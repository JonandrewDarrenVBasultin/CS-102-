"darkreignn","18 January 2021","I'm not the biggest Dragon Ball Z fan, but when my cousin wanted to watch ""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" with me, I decided to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did. ""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" is packed with high-octane and colorful action, warmhearted humor, and even some emotion and heart. Don't believe me? Read on!""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" hooked me almost right off the bat. The animation was crisp, colorful, and clear, and the story was surprisingly gripping. In the first ten to fifteen minutes you're introduced to plot points including themes such as paranoia, planetary domination, and betrayal. And as if that wasn't enough to grip me, at a certain point I even found my eyes starting to swell up; my cousin looked over to me, asking, ""Are you going to cry?"" And I wiped my eyes and said, ""I might.""So, ""Broly"" has high-quality animation, and a surprisingly well thought out plot - what else does it have going for it? For one, the soundtrack is, simply, epic. The music is big and brash and loud, and enhances the intensity of the action, as well as adds to the emotional beats.Also, the movie has a really good sense of humor throughout that never seems overly ridiculous or cartoony; there are multiple subtle lines of dialogue or sly actions that the characters make that add a real personality to this movie, never contrasting negatively against the semi-dark plot. Sure, there is comedy, but it doesn't feel shoehorned for mass audience appeal - everything feels surprisingly natural.""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" is a genuinely good film. There's enough cinematic meat for you to chew on with its soundtrack and beautiful, fluid animation, and especially with its story - the movie takes its time setting up the main plot, introducing characters and storylines that you'll want to see through to completion, even if you're not a huge fan of DBZ.","

"nmn34","20 January 2019","I cannot stress this enough, this is not a good introduction into the Dragonball series. If you have not watched the series, do not watch this movie. It will simply make no sense and you will get absolutely nothing out of it. Now that out of the way, this is definitely one of the best Dragonball movies, if not the best.To really see what the movie does well, its important to understand what its predecessors do wrong. They treat the movie like its own story arch, with a big bad and his minions scheming for the dragonballs, tree of life, a can of Coke or whatever, and its up to the heroes to come together and curb stomp them all in short, unimpressive fights. After laying out Toriyama's shopping list disguised as antagonists, the big bad readies to fight them to close out the last ten minutes and gets eliminated by some sort of plot device like Gohan's dormant power, a Hail Mary energy blast, or whistling. There is little catharsis and the villains are tossed in the trash never to be heard from again. Except for Broly. The hulking behemoth gets center stage in this movie, after exploring his character he is thrown headlong into a brutal slobber knocker that carries the movie further than any cockamamie scheme and cannon fodder ever could. The fight itself is masterfully paced, Broly has been fighting for training wheels all his life and finally meeting someone that can match him he just keeps improving until he can match the overpowered heroes. As they escalate, so does he until he becomes an unstoppable monster devoid of reason and mercy. It in itself tells an interesting story that can't be expressed in words. Finally, Broly is the main event threat that he is designed to be.This leads us back to another massive improvement, in spite of the popularity of the character, Broly's prior appearances aren't good. In fact, the chatracter's backstory has been downright stupid. In his first outing, his personal driving force was his disdain for baby Goku's crying when they were in the nursery. Its a postnatal grudge match, as ridiculous as that sounds. Sure there is the grudge his father has for Vegeta and the Saiyan race but most of it is Goku's crying. This is followed up with his clone Bio-Broly who melts pretty much instantly and can't even speak. To fix the character with one of the worst backstories the movies had ever contrived, they focused on what worked. Broly has never interacted with any of the main cast, he hasn't interacted with anyone but his father since before the series starts. Stranded together, the two have done nothing but refine him into a killing machine to reek revenge upon the Saiyan race that scorned them. He was a monster made, living a childhood devoid of kindness or care, the only creature he can endear himself to is a massive carnivorous beast and even that is taken from him by his tyrannical father. When he is found and brought before Frieza, he is seen as an impressive tool to avenge his defeat at the hands of Goku but proves too powerful for the alien tyrant to control. There is nothing superfluous about him, he is a force of nature that threatens the earth.With such a direct plot, its the fight that everyone paid to see and it gives everything in spades. The animation is crisp as it transitions into CGI and everything has a good sense of weight. Goku getting slammed alas Loki in the Avengers doesn't look like he is made of feathers, Broly slings him around like a bag of hammers while the heroes body goes ragdoll. There are plenty of zippy movements that lead into a very visually appealing scene where they break time and space with their fighting only to smash their way back. They even manage to work in some funny comedy as Goku and Vegeta rope Frieza into the fight. The only real complaint is how the initial fight with Vegeta ends, Goku simply steps in and Vegeta doesn't complain. It lacks any decisive winner and transitions poorly.Again, if you are a fan of the series this is a must see, but if not know that it does not explain anything. If anything I said doesn't make sense its only a fraction of the show specific terms that they will not define. There are flashbacks to scenes from the series that well have no context for those who have not seen them and characters who get no introduction at all. This is specifically for the fans","

"saimazaidi","14 December 2018",""" THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW""
Review:-
This is an absolute gem of a movie. Modern Dragon ball can't get any better than this. It was really phenomenol.
Here a few key features of the movie
(i) PLOT :
The movie is divided into 2 phases. The ""Past&The Present"". The start of the movie is all about the history of the saiyans. The movie does a half an hour long depiction of the history of the saiyans. The past is mostly based off ""DB MINUS"" with a few tid bits from the ""Bardock: The Father of Goku"".
The movie is more about broly. Broly was a saiyan with really high potential. King vegeta being jealous of broly's latent potential decided to send away baby broly to a far away planet ""Vampa"". Paragus(Father of broly) being betrayed by The King, vowed to find his son and one day get revenge on the king.
The movie explains about the ties of fate between Goku, Vegeta and Broly.
The present section of the movie takes place after ""THE TOURNAMENT OF POWER"". Its about the encounter of the 3 fated saiyans with each other.
Pretty simple plot not too complex or anythig but is really well written and executed pretty well!(ii) ANIMATION:
The animation of this movie is out of this world. Toriyama and Toei Animation decided to change the animation supervisor and character designer ""Tadayoshi Yamamuro"" to ""Nahiro Shinatni"". His animation is more fluid and gives a refreshing feel to the movie.
There is a use of CG as well. In short this is the best anime movie of 2018 when it comes to animation.
Having animators from My hero academia, one punch man etc working on it. Also got Toei's best staff with the likes of Naotoshi Shida, Yuya Takahashi, Naoki tate and other great animators.
The movie is a one hour and fourty minutes of pure "" SAGAKA"".(iii) MUSIC AND DIRECTION
Movie director is ""Nagamine"" who produced one of the best episodes of super like episode 95 or the introduction of Ultra Instinct etc.
The movie is directed really well by him. His story boards were really amazing.
The music is composed by "" Sumitomo"" who had his fair share of criticism from the fans because of his music in the beginning of super. His music in battle of gods was pretty good but in this movie its so emotional and captivating.
(iv) FIGHT SCENES:Dragon Ball is known for producing some of the best fights in all of anime. And this movie is no exception. With the likes of takahashi and Naotoshi shida handling the main action parts of the film, the fight scenes are absolutely mind blowing. Especially the final section of the movie where Shida brings his A game to the movie, shida mixed with Shinatni sheets produced some of the best fights in all of anime.(v) PROBLEMS:
Nothing is perfect and Dragon ball Super broly also had some tiny problems as well.
1. RUSHING: Sometimes the movie felt a bit rushed. Mainly because the original script of the movie was actually 3hours long so they had to narrow it down to 1 hour 40 minutes.That is why some sections are abit rushed but its not that big of a deal.
2.Lack of Tension : THE movie lacked tension as compared to the days of dbz. But still its just a tiny problem not that big of deal to ruin a movie.
3.Retcons :
There were a few retcons here and there. but i can ignore such retcons as they don't seem that big to me.(VI) CONCLUSION:
You should absolutely watch this movie.
Not only its animated really well ,it show case some of the best fights of 2018, and it has great music too. Please go and watching this movie in the theatres. Its theatrical experience will blow your mind.
Overall its a pretty solid movie.
9/10 for me !!!","

"Abir-Xtreme","15 December 2018","When Dragon Ball finally returned after its big hiatus with Battle of Gods, the expectations and the excitement were both at their zenith. Unfortunately, it failed to hold onto it with the poorly directed and somewhat unoriginal Resurrection of F. What followed was even worse with a poorly scheduled animated series that threw the animators between a rock and a hard place. The result was mass disappointment and criticism for the once beloved franchise and it wasn't until the Zamasu arc did people start seeing glimpses of what was once adored. By the time the tournament of power arc rolled around, the animation quality had gotten up considerably and while the storytelling still needed some work the direction overall was better. In a way, Dragon Ball Super Broly is a reward for those who stuck by the series despite the issues because it conquers everything that went wrong before.Let us begin, up first I would like to get the bad out of the way. The only real problem I have with the movie is the incredibly bland retelling of the Dragon Ball Minus Manga. It is by far the least creative thing Toriyama has ever produced and it hurts me a bit that they did not keep the original Anime's take on things. However, that being said it was a fun experience to see Goku's mother Gine finally drawn out in front of us. Couple that with Toei's attempt to pay some homage to the original Bardock story with a very similar demise and it does give the older fans something to feel good about early on. The other negative is the sudden super realistic CGI that is used between all this amazing 2d animation, which can kick you out of the immersion if you notice it for a bit.Now let us focus on the actual movie and see what it offers, the general idea of the story is to connect a line between our main characters Goku and Vegeta with the new and improved Broly. When I say 'IMPROVED' I mean that in every send of the word. The little things with Broly before any of the action even begins is what actually makes you like him. Director Tatsuya Nagamine essentially split Broly into two beings, one is this curious and unsociable outcast that really just wants to be loyal to his father and feels disconnected from the world due to his unfortunate circumstances. The other side is shown during the intense action scenes when he sheds all emotion and turns into a savage monster that embodies everything from the original noncanon movie. This way you somewhat satisfy both the casual fans who want him to be the hulk of the franchise and those who wanted more depth in the character.Now the general plot without any major spoilers comes down to Freeza attempting to steal the Dragon balls yet again though this time for a far more ridiculous goal and while doing so, some of his soldiers come across Broly and Paragus who were outcast by King Vegeta out of sheer jealousy. They are convinced by Freeza that the best way to exact due revenge would be to travel to Earth and take down Vegeta, the eldest son of the late King Vegeta. Which automatically sets Broly on a collision course against Goku as well. They arrive on an icy land and so begins the battle. Here is where I would like to start talking about the animation and voice acting, for the longest time I looked at other animated Japanse shows like My Hero Academia, Mob Psycho and One Punch man and said to myself, how amazing would it really be If Dragon Ball could match that level? Well, I am glad to tell you guys that they have matched and exceeded our expectations for animation here. The kind of madness at display here is nothing but pure excellence. Which is expected when you have the likes Yuya Takahashi, Yuki Hayashi, Naotoshi Shida, Yoshihiko Umakoshi, Chikashi Kobuta and Ryo Onishi pulling the strings behind the frames. All this is only possible due to Naohiro Shintani freeing us from the shackles of Tadiyoshi Yamamura who had plagued the animated series with his poor designs. As for the voice acting, while I haven't had the pleasure to hear the English cast yet I can assure fans of the Japanese version that they bring out some of their best performances yet. Especially the voice acting of Katsuhisa Hôki as Paragus, he completely knocks it out of the park with arguably the most complex character. Aya Hisakawa, who had the incredibly hard job of replacing Hiromi Tsuru was also more than adequate. Other highlights include Nana Mizuki as Cheelai and of course Masako Nozawa for multiple characters.Overall, I am happy that Toei Animation finally took the steps necessary to evolve their most valuable series through this movie and I hope this continues in the years to come.Dragon Ball Super Broly is one of the best animated films of the year and provides you with Akira Toriyama's trademark humor and out of this world battles, which is only taken to the next level by the fantastic direction of Tatsuya Nagamine.","

"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","21 December 2018","Well, this movie is pretty logical and I'm glad they are taking this stuff seriously. There were some confusing things but they were pretty much explained.
It is clear why Goku's parents did not leave to Earth with him (enemy would sense them). It is clear what was happening during the hour when Gogeta was in bad shape (Whis was distracting Broly).The only question I have is why Goku didn't use SSB Kaio Ken x20, but probably he didn't want to break his body because thought that will not help.It's cool that Gogeta used the mastered version of SSB transformation.
It is good that Vegeta pretty much received as much attention as Goku.
I'm glad that they didn't make Broly extremely strong and he actually easily lost to Gogeta, because power levels are getting out of hand now. But if you give them time it's ok. I just wonder what's gonna happen with Broly? We will have now 3 main characters, wtf? Even Vegeta did not get his shine yet, Goku always gets everything first.The only reason I give this 8/10 is because I was lacking overwhelming emotions. The strongest emotion I had was when Broly attacked Vegeta and Vegeta smiled. I was like ""omg, that's my man Vegeta!"". Also there were a few nice emotional moments from the past of Goku.","

"johnofardeal","19 February 2019","I enjoyed this a lot! The thing that I liked the most was the choreography of the fight scenes. Amazing! I really felt like being there with them the whole time. The animation is gorgeous most of the time, except some moments when the CGI looks a bit blocky, videogame-ish, but it moves fast so you won't notice it very often.Another strong point was how they managed to rewrite Broly's story and fit it in the greater Dragonball universe. I think they did a good job at explaining most of the changes added to the characters. A lot of great cameos. The new characters were also enjoyable and the creatures from Broly's planet were really interesting, especially his giat pet.Satisfying climax. Of course, Gocku and Vegeta fighting together is always a pleasure to witness and the fan service is strong with this one. Also, Broly's transformation is just violent.I didn't like some of the design changes for the main cast. Sometimes it felt a bit weird watching someone's who's supposed to be Vegeta not being very Vegeta-like. But it's ok. The animation is more fluent and so they probably had to adapt. Also, it felt like there were no real stakes. I mean, after seeing Goku use UI in the series it's hard to bring some guy and make him instantly more powerful, but again, that's just how Dragonball is.Great movie! Thank you to all involved in making it!","

"educallejero","24 January 2019","The writing. My freaking god, the god awful writing was insufferable. The story was meaningless and it didn't improve the non-canon version from the 90's.All the characters were respected (contrary to the more childish, yes even way more childish DBSuper movies), but also totally boring. There was no tension of any kind, and even if I like were the movie went at the end, there were a millon better ways to get there.Another thing: At some point a character has to evolve. If it doesn't, what's the point of having these repetetive stories? It's always fighting a tough villain, so without character development, it gets really boring.The movie was slow, and the storytelling ""5 years old inclusive"" (which might be a great commercial decision, but I'm not 5, so it got into my nerves).It felt pure DBZ, no question, but also... it felt EXACTLY 1990 pure DBZ!Itsn't 2019 already? Why not use DIFFERENT CHARACTERS to showcase different emotions and relationships and grow? That won't happen if you only use Vegeta and Goku.-----
Having said that: Yes, the movie was atrocious in almost every way. But also, the spectacle was the best that DBZ has ever shown. The animation, and different animation techniques, plus the ""choreography"" was INSANE. In that important aspect, it was a 10. When you take account for the atrocious ""0 points"" deserving story, you get the five.--------
Please re-watch the non-canon Broly movie. It is better at everything but the budget for the fight scenes (and even if it is ""smaller"" it does have a good and way more emotional fight against Broly).","

"msbreviews","15 March 2019","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you stopped following Dragon Ball after Z or you don't even know what DB is, you'll basically be lost. You won't recognize certain characters, you won't understand how and why some guys are still alive, and you'll have no clue about how strong our warriors became. This is for the fans. I've seen critics bashing this film to shreds, and they start their reviews stating ""I've never seen the anime."" Then why would you watch a movie that clearly follows the anime's story and review it? Just leave it alone!This is the best Dragon Ball film ever, by a long shot. Yes, the track record wasn't that good to begin with, and most of the movies released aren't even canon. Still, Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' were pretty great, especially the former. Broly easily surpasses these two, in almost every aspect. Of course, I need to be fair to those first films. Dragon Ball Super elevated the anime once again and brought it back to the mainstream, so obviously, Broly had a lot of advantages since the studios offered everything they could so that the movie would be a major success. When the first two films were released, Super didn't exist yet. Basically, these first movies were trying to bring back Dragon Ball to life while Broly is all about keeping it alive and showing it still has tremendous potential.Thankfully, it all worked out perfect. The box office results are mind-blowing which will surely guarantee the continuation of Super (I'm waiting every single day for the news of the series renewal), and the film is, in fact, astonishing. The animation quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. You know when you go with friends to watch a movie and something so awesome occurs that you just look at each other in awe of what just happened? That's Broly every single minute from the moment the fight begins. Super gave the fans a glimpse of what the animation level could be if time was not an issue for the animators. The Tournament of Power arc is undeniable proof that when the production leaves the animators work with no pressure, the end result is outstanding.It's just so freaking awesome. This is the only word in the dictionary that can reflect how crazily good the animation is. Awesome. There are so many long sequences of choreographed fights, with the animation always on-point, and with exceptional editing. The aspect I love the most is probably how fast it all is. Finally, I can understand Krillin when he says ""how are you following that?!"" Everything flows in such a flawless style: the characters, the blasts, the environment, everything. The sound design is incredibly powerful, as well. From the get-go, you know you'll feel every punch, kick, ""Kamehameha"" and ""Galick Gun."" Goku, Vegeta, and Broly provide so many amazing action scenes, and I know I'll constantly rewatch them once they become available. God, Super ended a year ago, and I still find myself watching the final fight with Jiren every week or so.However, Dragon Ball isn't about the fights. Yes, everyone loves them, and there are a lot of fans who only care about the actual moment when our heroes fight their enemies. As a hardcore fan of the saga, it's so much more than that. If characters like Goku and Vegeta, but also Piccolo, Gohan or even Frieza didn't exist, their battles wouldn't have the same impact. They mean something because these characters are important to me. I care so much about them because they were beautifully-developed throughout hundreds of episodes. I know that fillers can be a bit boring, but for me, they were just another way of getting to know these characters. Give me twenty minutes of banter between Goku and Vegeta, and I'll be the happiest man on Earth, right now.I'll put it this way: if you enjoyed Battle of Gods more than Resurrection 'F', you will love DBS: Broly as much or more than I do. If it's the other way around, the first half of this film might leave you a bit disappointed. If you're one of those fans who only care about the fights, you can leave the first 45 minutes with barely any Goku or Vegeta to me and the other fans who care about the story. I heavily praise Akira Toriyama's screenplay. This is the big difference to the other non-canon movies: they weren't written by someone who really understands the characters at their disposal. Toriyama knows exactly who Broly is, where he comes from, and how he lived through his young years.He wonderfully flushes out Broly by giving him an emotionally captivating backstory, filled with parent abuse, violence, and isolation from the rest of the universe. The history of Saiyans and Planet Vegeta is (finally) told entirely, by showing us characters that we all know and love, but that we were never able to see for more than a few minutes. Nevertheless, the standout character of the film is Broly. He has more screentime than any of the other warriors, precisely due to the reason I mentioned above: for us to care about him. Truth is, when they start fighting, I don't want anyone to win or lose, because I genuinely care about all of them. Toriyama wasted half of the movie to develop this ""new"" character, and I 100% support his decision. Not only it generates more build-up to the inevitable climax, but it offers more layers to it. It stopped being ""just a fight.""Obviously, there were going to be nods to the past adventures. I almost dropped a tear when Goku and Vegeta show up for the first time due to the soundtrack alone. You'll love every single ""flash"" regarding previous moments of Dragon Ball history, including the latest series and arc. Toriyama also does a remarkable job in helping fans that never watched Super trying to understand what happened after Z, even if he didn't need to. The comedy bits are hilarious, as they have been with the latest series. From Vegeta yelling at Goku for doing or saying something dumb, to Bulma's interactions with Beerus and Whis, every joke lands in one way or another.As much as I love this film, it does have some issues regarding its mixing of CGI with animation. One of the things I didn't like at all in Resurrection 'F' was how some sequences felt like a video game. Unfortunately, there are a couple of moments like that in Broly. In order to keep the scenes flow without any cuts, CGI is necessary so the camera can change to another angle, and sometimes there's this feeling that you seem to be playing one of Dragon Ball games. However, my biggest gripe has to be with the overuse of visual effects. Using VFX to build rich environment and help the battles have more impact, not only doesn't work well but it's just not Dragon Ball.As we reach the climax, the VFX overpower the animation, and that is never a good thing. The fight loses its animated essence, and it becomes something that I don't even know how to describe, except that it isn't what it was supposed to be. In addition to this, even though I stated that this movie is about Broly and Broly alone, I would have loved to see more from Frieza. He acts purely as a plot device, and there's barely anything for him to actively do, but he's still important to make the plot move forward. Finally, the pacing could have been more balanced. Since the ending is predictable from even before the fight begins, it feels that the film was a bit stretched to try to reach the two-hour runtime.Also, if you've seen all the trailers, you basically know the entire movie. That's why I keep advising my followers to stop watching trailers or at least all of them. If you really need visual confirmation that the film deserves your time and money, watch the first trailer and decide from there. Dragon Ball Super always gave spoiler-heavy previews of the next episode, and the movie literally shows everything. Even without watching a single clip from it, I couldn't escape the spoilers regarding the appearance of specific characters, which pretty much ruined any surprise the film could have offered me. Even with that in mind, I still think the ending felt a bit rushed, contradicting the somewhat slow pace during the first two acts.In the end, there's no doubt about it. Dragon Ball Super: Broly is, by far, the best Dragon Ball movie to date, and it's really freaking awesome! It beats any other installment of the franchise, including the latest films. Akira Toriyama working together with a phenomenal team of animators is a match made in heaven. The story is remarkably well-written, with a full half dedicated to introduce and develop Broly as a mentally troubled child who had to deal with so much pain during his life. The animation reaches its peak quality-wise, demonstrating that when time is given to the animators, their work can be a visual masterpiece. With such an intriguing backstory on the history of Saiyans and a brilliantly structured build-up to an epic fight between Broly, Goku, and Vegeta, there was still time to cherish the nostalgia with some nods to previous moments in the beloved saga, as well as some hilarious comedy bits.With more control over the use of CGI and visual effects, this could very well be one of 2019's best movies. It still can be, but the climactic final battle lost of a bit of its impact due to the overwhelming VFX which completely overcame the animation itself. The ending is predictable before we reach half-runtime, and the spoiler-heavy trailers didn't help to keep surprise as a factor. I have to repeat what almost every critic has been saying: if you're a fan of the saga and you kept up with Super, this will give you everything you want and more. If you're just a casual moviegoer or if you stopped watching after Z, it's better if you don't ""poison"" social media with opinions on a film that simply wasn't made for you.Thank you, Toriyama! Thank you for giving me the chance to see my favorite anime on the big screen for the first time, and for making it epic.","

"delusions_of_greed","22 January 2019","Let me start by stating that I'm a HUGE Dragon Ball fan! So needless to say, I was very excited about this movie, but it absolutely did not live up to my expectations. The plot was definitely better and made more sense than the original and the action was INCREDIBLE, but outside of that, the movie was...... dumb. They had so many opportunities to make the movie interesting, but they chose to cut corners and go with the most stereotypical plots. And the music. My God, the music was hysterical. In a bad way. At first you don't notice it, but once you get into the real action it does this hilarious Deadpool 2 thing where they sing ""Broly"" in an epic manner, but the biggest difference between DP2 and Broly is that DP2 intentionally made it funny, but DBS tried to make it serious and it turned out to be one of the things I laughed at the loudest. And the end.... Let's just say, I see what they plan on doing, but it was the most cop out way to end it. All in all, the movie is not good. Go into it with low expectations and maybe you'll enjoy it, but the action scenes and animation were it's only saving grace.","

"umlaziking","16 August 2022","It's a freaking awesome movie. I believe that this broly is a far more fantastic and a far better written broly than the previous psychopathic broly. This broly actually had a relatable story and an amazing character design. I will admit, it's not an entirely perfect movie and I admit, the comedy was really funny but at some points in my own humble opinion it was a bit over done. But I will say that this movie is the best dragon ball movie to come out in years, there's a reason why it's the highest grossing dragon ball movie of all time and there's a reason why so many people, not only in Japan but around the world... completely enjoy this movie. Im glad I got the chance to watch this, I'm glad we got to see broly in action again after so many years and I'm extremely glad that broly is finally canon in the main story of dragonball. I just hope they use him more for dbs arcs and not sideline him like they did with Frieza.","

"cookienocrazy","26 January 2019","I should start this by saying this was my introduction to the Dragon Ball franchise, and as some other reviewers have noted this might not be the best jumping in point. That said, fresh impartial eyes can be useful for giving an objective review, and I am familiar with anime, as well as other Japanese cinema and culture.
There was definitely something to enjoy here; the animation was solid, the soundtrack and audio in general was good. BUT this film suffers from major structural issues.
The first half of the film is fairly rushed backstory, rushing you through some pretty complex and convoluted history without allowing any space in which a character (any character) can be written with even the slightest depth. The second half is a fight scene between a few of those characters. Really, the whole second half of the movie is one drawn out battle. It's an impressive battle, with some pretty great direction and engaging moments. It's not unenjoyable, but it lacks the depth required to care about the outcome.
Ultimately, this film doesn't really have a story. It has convoluted BACKstory and a fight. That's all.
As I left the cinema I overheard some die-hard fans say 'it felt like half a movie'. I agree. There's stuff to enjoy in that half a movie, but that's what it is.","

"GeorgeStrCy89","7 February 2019","First of all I must say this is probably the best dragon ball movie. It satisfies those who know about the events taking place before this movie, and also those who have no idea about it and never watched anything dragon ball related in the past.Now to enter the movie, I can separate it in two parts: a) the story and b) the fight. I believe I haven't seen any dragon ball movie in the past with such a crazy and long fight, what was great about it was the fact that I didn't feel bored at any moment. Of course in order to make the fight have sense they had to start the film with the events that took place decades ago. Maybe the power levels didn't make sense at some point but I can understand they wanted to show little bit of everything, it's also a bit crazy how Broly manages to adapt so fast, to Super Saiyan God and Blue while he was in base form for so long (imagine this guy achieving God and Blue powers). I am happy they rebooted such a fan favorite character like Broly, for those who'd seen Dragon Ball Super series will probably know there is a character similar with Broly from another universe, but this one looks much more promising (and already more loved). For those who just saw this movie and have no idea about the Super series, let me tell you something, you should go and watch it, especially the tournament of power arc. Do you remember in this movie when Goku said ""Tournament of power opened my eyes""? in that tournament he managed to awake a far more greater power, yes all the core fans know what I'm talking about! In this movie they didn't show anything about it (and there is reasoning behind it) but I believe they just wanted to introduce Broly in the series. The thing I liked the most about the movie was the ending (after the end of this crazy fight), it felt like a promise we will see a lot more from Broly in the future. One thing I couldn't imagine was that maybe we will get to see Broly fight alongside Goku and the rest of the gang since Goku is willing to help Broly becoming stronger (if possible), and also train with him to achieve even greater power and possibly reach his limits too.Before I finish this review, I wanted to say one more thing. I have a question for my ""beloved"" critics. I know it's your job to always try to find something negative to say about anything, well since I read the last few weeks some of you called this Japanese THING nonsensical, well how much sense can it have when it's science fiction? I highly doubt that you have any idea about dragon ball, did you watch the series before this movie? Hope you will enjoy the movie!","

"elonmusk-is_a_moron","13 August 2022","Animation wise, this movie is excellent. Dragon Ball movies never looked this good before.I also liked the introduction, revealing more details of the Saiyan life.And the fight scenes were simple wonderful.But a couple of things left a sour taste in my mouth:First, and more importantly, the awful characterization of Goku which started in Dragon Ball Super (Yes, I know Toriyama said Goku is ""not a hero"" like Superman, but there is a line between being a hero, and befriending guys that regularly commit genocide)He is an idiot here. A totally unlikeable idiot with no more thoughts other than ""I must fight strong guys"". So, so annoying.We have reached the point where Vegeta, a former cruel villain from this series, is more heroic than him. If Super continues this path, soon even Nappa would be more heroic than him.The second, is Frieza.I see some fans already claiming Frieza is the ""Joker"" of the Dragon Ball Franchise. For me, that is awful. Look, I do not hate Batman, but one of the reasons of why I preferred manga over the DC or Marvel comics, it's because there is real progress in the stories, the villains (and some heroes) stay dead, instead of keeping an eternal status quo where nothing can never change: This is made purely for commercial purposes; the real reason Batman cannot kill the Joker is not because the writers want to make a profound statement about how ""killing is wrong"", but is made because the editors are afraid of losing the Joker hardcore fans as part of their readership.So, no matter what, Batman can never kill the Joker, and he always keeps escaping from Arkam asylum and nothing ever changes.I hate the status quo from superhero western comics, because it totally squanders any form of character development in favor of endless pandering.So yeah, the last thing I would want for Dragon Ball is to follow that route. I can get over Frieza coming back to life once. I can get over the addition of another Frieza looalike character. So resurrecting him a second time (And by Goku, no less!) was way too much.Worse, at the end of the horrible Dragon Ball Super, he gets away scott-free, and this movie shows him continuing his genocide on the galaxy. And Goku? He simply does not care, and allows Frieza to roam free (Despite the clear warning Vegeta gave to him, about how ridiculously strong Frieza could get just by training a couple of months)This movie, like the horrible, horrid Dragon Ball Super, is just another victory for Frieza. He got away with everything, and they try to pass this as a ""happy ending"". Now Goku is just one step away of being best pals with the same guy that killed all his people.It might sound like nit-picking, but it kinda ruins my enjoyment of this movie, disregard of the positive elements. I cannot stand the new Peter Griffin Goku that only cares about fighting and befriends genocidal tyrants because he is ""not a hero"".But hey, at least the animation was nice. And New good Broly is an ok character.","

"taurusent","20 February 2019","First of all I have to say that this movie amazing, but mainly thanks to the animation. I think is the best animation I have ever seen. Except for some CG parts which seems really unpolished, the animation is a 10.
The story is quite ok, but retelling the same old stuff for that long is not that great in my opinion. And Broly, now has a personality, wow, but it is nothing crazy or unexpected. He is better because the old Broly is a screaming beast.
But yeah, it is Dragon Ball so the complexity of characters and story are not the main thing.
And here comes my main complaint, the power levels are nonexistent and completely destroyed. For me it makes no sense whatsoever. Yeah, Super anime ruined the power levels, but now they are irrelevant 100%.
I get it, Broly is gifted, he had a harsh life etc. But so are Goku and Vegeta!! They are stronger than some of the gods, they defeated countless opponents, they trained all their life...but this doesnt matter at all.
What is the point of transforming in Super Saiyan GOD if that stupid ass Broly can handle it in his base form. Whats the point of changing hair colours every 5 minutes? Because thats how transformations felt in this movie, honestly.
It just seems a big big fan service for 10 year olds. They made Broly that strong just to have a reason to put Gogeta in the movie...it felt so so so forced.
Anyway, what can I say, it is clear that this movie was made with passion, love, and a lot of money and hard work, they ruined it with the fan service, the Gogeta thing.
In my opinion, Broly at his maximum power should have been easily handled by Blue Goku or Vegeta, to make some sort of sense...
I waited so long for this movie to see how everything becomes pointless. Goku and Vegeta should have started in Blue form because it felt like base form anyway.
It was a show, an amazing one, but it has to make at least a bit of sense to me to be enertaining.My ratings are:
Animation: 10
Storyboard: 10
Music: 9
Story: 6
Any sort of logic: 2Hope you find this useful, and maybe share the same opinion in some regards. Have a good day and enjoy the movie!","

"nunophoenix-683-948557","28 January 2019","As someone who's been following the series since the 90's, this movie was no surprise to me, not because of the abundant spoilers and info all around the internet concerning the script and other details but because, as expected, this extremely rushed movie is purely fan service and nothing else. The majority of millennials, kids and fanboys will go crazy with all the visual effects and the chaos that hides the numerous frames filled with poorly drawn characters and extremely ugly animations, just like many gaming studios do with graphics effects to hide visual flaws. You doubt? Just watch the fight in slow motion, which is basically the only decent way to follow the action and keep up anyway... Besides that expect the usual contradictions, the ""Hulk"" of the DB universe with a very weak background story and nonsense power (even for the series ""standards""), jumpy and weird camera angles that make you think you're watching a Jason Bourne movie (same flaw as BOG and ROF) and a significant but forgettable ending. Another failed ""reboot"".","

"Nayr39","3 February 2019","Dragonball movies have always had their issues, they're generally just poorly written and paced fan service doses for people to enjoy fun what if scenarios. This one takes that and pushes it to it's limit but without actually developing an interesting antagonist or any ounce of suspense around it. Like every Dragonball movie you know going in none of the characters are at threat, the planet will be fine and all will revert back to normal at the end of it. So the core of this movie has to come from the action and the character moments. This version of Broly is superior but ultimately just as shallow despite rewriting his character and making him more sympathetic. The writing during these moments is still weak at best, it's clearly catering to children and potential newcomers alike with awkward overly explanatory dialogue and at other times hitting you with stuff so simply or poorly written you can't help but roll your eyes. Thankfully there are many visual treats here, but all as formulaic as ever, you will see our main characters start out at their normal base level, then slowly ramp up with increasing levels of strength and set pieces until something inevitably happens to push the fight over the edge and end it. Unlike most Dragonball movies we get a different ending, our antagonist is actually saved and given a second shot at life, but on his prison of a home planet instead and our characters arch rival is just let go to kill and torture whoever he wants, despite Goku supposedly being a goodhearted person who would never let anyone on Earth suffer, but hey, random Frieza henchmen and anyone he decides to kill as he travels through space? Ay okay in Goku's book. Moment's like this make any character moments that need to shine fall flat, nothing is consistent, everything is convenient, references and callbacks like the Krilin/Namek moment or the fusion dance nonsense is all here in it's boring glory. Nothing feels fresh except for the fight choreography and animation. Which if you really want to just see beautiful animation, it's okay, but you could just go watch Redline. Instead you get a repetitive predictable slog of a beatdown with no twists or anything to worry about. It's a retread of a existing movie that does very little new. Watch if you are a massive fan of Super or for some reason enjoy brainless animation but other than that steer clear. There's not much of worth here sadly and far to many repeated mistakes that for some reason can just not be fixed even after the many years this franchise has exised.","

This movie is a complete revision of the original one, and it works so good. The animations are spot on, the storyboard, and everything else. The fighting scenes are the best ever to happen in all the series or the movies. This is just Amazing.
The only downfall is the composition of the movie. Initially all the material was about 3h long, and they had to cut it down. And you kinda notice it in the first half. For that only a 9/10, but I reckon once the Blue-Ray version is out, it might be a solid 10/10.","

"whoopwhoopywhop","20 January 2019","How many retcons are we going to have to see of Frieza wiping out the Sayians? It seems like anytime we try to go back and visit an earlier time period we end up with some sort of timeline inconsistency.This movie is plagued with established plot elements that just get ignored later on. The biggest ones I can recall are:Raditz somehow knowing that his parents sent Goku off to Earth. He was away on a mission and they had stated earlier that communication using the scouters is monitored so how exactly did he get that information?Broly turning super sayain. This one is so laughably bad. Broly's father explains that if broly gets too out of control he loses all sense of himself. After fighting in this state for quite some time Frieza decides to kill his father in order to trigger the emotional response that Goku had on Namek when Krillen died. The problem with that is, Broly is a mindless killing machine at this point, his father's death should have had no effect. Broly had shown more emotional attachment to a severed ear, than his father (who forced Broly to kill the only friend he had)
Personally I would have had Vegeta accidentally grab the ear in the middle of a fight, say something about how disgusting it is and have him blast it. That would have at least paid off the emotional character arc set up earlier in the story.Overall, the fight scenes are good, but the story lacks any substance. I'd wait for the eventual arc they'll do when more super episodes come out.","

I will not give away too much, but if you haven't seen it just know that our heroes were once again triumphant. However, this time they made a friend which was so nice to see. Battle scenes were excellent, dialogue terrible -but what else do you expect from a Super movie? The pacing was just right and the character development spot in! 9/10","

"anibal-portillo","9 February 2019","It's a great movie, the history is quite different than the original, but certainly the flow with the DBS saga is great and compatible, is credible. Animation is good, very fast and clear in every action scene, the humor is acceptable also as this is a SHOUNEN is logical to have it there and I can live with that because I love anime. One of the best scenes is the Adult Broly Entrance, is full of dramatic power in one single hit!! Insane entrance!!! I love it!!!","

Reason:
1) Many Dragon Ball Movies are usually as many claim ""LMAT"" Last Moment Asspull Technique but this one had feeling of watching Superhero Origin Story
2) Slick & fluid animation & Fight Sequence & Action Choreography was Fantastic & better than ToP unlike usual ATATATATATA
3) Broly had better backstory than Broly:LSSFully Satisfied ***********************************************","

"ernestocatalan","19 January 2019","The animation could have been better. I only enjoyed this because I'm a die hard fan but the movie's pacing starts slow. I didn't like that there was no detail to characters until a match started, they look bland and unfinished like a cheap cartoon. The fights were pretty good with cool visuals and if you haven't seen dbz before there's a lot of screaming. If you didn't grow up with DBz then you may not enjoy this one.","

"KayMcDaniels","28 January 2019","Just got home from seeing Broly a second time, this time with my daughter, who is 9. Being her very first movie theater experience, this was a pretty momentous event, and she was thrilled to see a Dragon Ball movie as her first! I watched her more than the movie, because I wanted to make sure her reaction was just as much as mine was, and thank you Akira it was!Having said that, this movie was just as amazing the second time viewing as the first, as I'm sure it'll be the 50th! With exception of a very serious fan base in the audience (first viewing was opening night and it was packed with hardcore fans who applauded every transformation and cheered with every momentous moment, including Freizas terrible acting after killing Paragas!) Dragon Ball Super: Broly is without exception the best movie of this year!I know that most fans are up in arms over the change of origins story for both Broly and Goku, but I much prefer this to the previous origin story, as this one made Broly seem much more human and more relatable as a character rather than this overblown and overpowered character he was depicted as in the three previous Broly movies.The fact that this movie could potentially be included into the Dragon Ball Super canon makes it all the more wonderful! If I could rate this movie higher than 10 stars I would!","

I was really impressed by a lot of the action and effects, even though some outshined other parts, it just had the old school feel with a few touch ups. Really, really impressed with what this movie had to offer! Broly was an absolute beast and seeing Goku and Vegeta fight him was truly just bone chilling. I love it!!! Any fans of the series will really appreciate how they connected this movie into the story line! Seriously hope they make more movies and continue to impress! My only complaint is some graphical continuity problems, I want the effects and graphics to be more consistent!! Overall it's a must see!!!","

"nmik2005","25 January 2019","Broly has been one of the best character's that has come out of the Dragonball movie canon's and fans have been hoping that he'd be actually part of the canon and finally this has happened. This movie not only adds a lot more depth to Broly's character than any of the other movies but also adds a lot more backstory to Dragon ball mythos. I am not sure how I feel about the change that was made to Bardock's story but I guess the Bardock special was never an official canon according to the makers, so maybe that's ok.So back to the movie, wow. The fights are so exhilarating and is way better than any of the fights ever show in the anime. The animation was top notch, the only complaint would be some of silly humor which could be a hit or miss at times and the mediocre sound track. The fights definitely made up for the average sound track.In conclusion, Dragonball Super Broly is definitely a must watch for any fans of the franchise.","

Why they introducing more useless new side characters? Why is Trunks and Goten in this movie again?Both Trunks and Goten ruined the last two Broly films with there annoying antics! Come on give Broly a break from these two characters! Why is this new Broly better then old one? I know why he was popular because he was to awesome for your eyes!I don't need to know about Goku parents definitely if you keep on retconning same Saiyan home planet blowing up for tenth time. Sure Cooler will be involved next yeah more Frieza screentime.Frieza again oh great he wants Broly as a weapon oh please Broly put Final Super Nail into him. Gogeta was way better in Fusion Reborn & as SSJ4 in GT then he was here.Stick to original Legendary Super Saiyan Broly film thats way better canon movie.","

This is definitely revolutionary for dragonball to have a good plot in a movie. Is it really good? No but it's amazing when compared with other dragon ball films, you can indeed get emotional and most things makes sense. Decent amount of humour, breath taking fight scenes and acts as a huge catalyst for the future of super.The impact in 2d animation industry is huge, it just shows to people that if done right 2D animation can easily outshine any 3D animation be it Pixar or Sony. It just goes to show the amount of effort that went into this film and the fighting sequence, choreography and pacing are all done right.1 mark deducted from unnecessary CG and the fact that the plot is not amazingly good. 9/10 for dragonball fans. 8.5/10 for shonen anime lovers but haven't watched all of dragonball. 7.5/10 for random guy who just wanted to watch a film.","

however, one also could not deny that the core content is recycled, there are no new characters, no new plots, once again, it is merely freiza and broly and gogeta even if it is one of the rarest to appear, yet again, this recycled content is put in presented excellently and in a nearly perfect way that covered the dull fact of its repeatedness and expectedness,

"charmingkostas","24 January 2019","The announcement of this film brought back some long-forgotten memories. It was a few years back, when the Battle of Gods was announced, triggering tsunamis of excitement from long-time fans of the Dragon Ball series.Yet, the final product was bland, and failed to deliver; more or less like what happened with the follow-up film, ""Revival F"". There was promise, but the execution was poor. Then, we welcomed the new Dragon Ball series, some fifteen years after the end of Dragon Ball Z. We stayed with it, till its finale last March, and an anoouncement of an action-packed film that would focus on the past of Sayans. Again, more promises.Only, this time, things are different. To be honest, the part of the film that deals with the events of the past could have been omitted. After all, the star of the film is Broly. A Broly who is far from the caricature that was presented in the DBZ films. This Broly has feelings and emotions. This Broly is ready to fight, in order to protect those he cares about. This Broly is an absolute beast, a brute - yet only because he is confused. He's trying to survive in an unfamiliar place, misled by the revenge-driven villains of the film.But all these facts can only guarantee one thing; that we are treated to almost an hour of intense fighting, superbly executed and fluid animated scenes, humoristic instances and moments we feel like we can't take any more of what we see. The plot's role is to provide a (solid) background to the immense action, something which is good for newcomes, but a tad tasteless to old-time fans.Voice acting from the Funimation legends is top-notch, whereas the score gives some thrilling vibes, with it being repetitive at some points and lacking the epicness of Sumitomo's work in the past films and the recent series.Overall, Dragon Ball Super: Broly brings back all the things that led the series to stardom and to being part of the popular culture for the past 30+ years. Fans following the series are sure to spot a few things they might not totally enjoy here and there. However, people who are planning to see the movie are due to a fantastic experience, that pays tribute to the series and brings promise to whatever comes up next.","

In that moment also is explained how Frieza becomes the king of an army, and why Vegeta, Goku, Radditz, Napa and Vegeta's brother didn't die on the explosion.2- The comedy is pretty good even in the middle of the fight this movie can make you laugh without getting out of context.3- Action last about 1 Hour, yes, 1 hour and you barely feel time pass because you get into it like if this was another episode with a Great combat scenes and great animation.","

"MoistMovies","24 January 2019","For using a lot of CGI, they blended it better than any other anime ive seen using the medium. But still, many parts felt like they were cut scenes from a video game with more money put in, mainly the battle scenes. I couldnt escape that feeling unfortunately. It kept reminding me of how great they used to accomplish the fights in DBZ's later sagas, and how after all this time, they shoudlve been able to hand draw the fights and totally out do that earlier ones from the series/films.I get that its more expensive these days to do it all hand drawn, but considering the popularity of dragonball. They can afford to. 8 mil budget, and already they made 10x over that. Double the budget and keep most of it hand drawn and it'd have felt more like a animated film, rather than mash of film and video game cut scenes.And then theres the story, for the most part i enjoyed it. A different take on many familiar stories from the past when i grew up watching DBZ. But Frieza.. his motivations and story were silly and made no sense..
The height wish was very original dragon ball. But it felt out of place. And obviously a gag they intended to be in the same contrast to bullmas, it took me out of the film as being too far out of context with the rest of what was going on. Its been along time since original dragonball and frieza was never in it. The style of comedy didnt fit for me with him.
And i thought they'd have him grow as a character by now which i felt they were doing well in Super towards the end. One of my favorite parts of that series.
But in this film they regressed him back to a by the numbers villain type which i found unfortunate.
Goku is still less likable than he used to be, a change that happened early in Super, Im used to that now. So it didnt effect my enjoyment. He's growing as a character, just not the way i'd like. And vegeta becoming the responsible type more and more is what i prefer. But it creates a contrast that moves the stroy along for Super, so it's something i've grown to accommodate.Worth seeing in a theater if you're a dragonball/z/super fan. But if you're an older viewer like myself, you may not feel the same hype other younger viewers did especially if you are a critical person who loved the older sagas of DBZ and like hand drawn animation.","

"ahoffyman","18 January 2019","To start I'd like to clarify I have been a dbz fan since I was 7 years old when I discovered DBZ on toonami in 2000. Since then I have seen DB, DBZ,GT, Super, every movie and special, and read the manga. I was an avid collector of dozens of action figures and toys as a kid and have bought tons of DB merchandise over the years. I became a black belt in Taekwondo, and made dozens of friends through DB, many of whom I'm friends with to this day. I played through all the game boy games many times and decorated my entire room in Orange and blue, with a DBZ mural above my DB clock on the wall. I had the promotional cardboard stand ups for both legend of Goku games in my room and........You get the picture. I am thoroughly familiar with and enjoy DB comedy and style.
Now I say all that to clarify that I am indeed a lifelong DB fan as it has helped shaped who I am today.
With all that said I need to mention some gripes with this movie that many of the fans have overlooked and are overhyping(looking at these other reviews).
This will contain plot spoilers on the movie, but nothing too specific. This is an honest review coming from a fan who is also a film buff, and is not content with just blindly screaming ""This is the greatest movie ever made"", as some have stated(please).I will start with what this movie did well.This movie is Based on DragonballZ, obviously. A series that earned its popularity largely on the quality of its action sequences. It is therefore quite ironic that this movie shines brightest during its first half. During this time we are told the story of the origin of the Saiyans draft into the Frieza force; a new(far more realistic and superior) origin story for Paragus and his powerful son, Broly; Our first on-screen introduction to Gine and her family relationship with Bardock and sons; and a nice nod to the older fans regarding The Father of Goku special. Everything done before the flash-forward to present day is emaculate. Story, animation, cinematography, characters, motivation; everything was phenomenal.
Once the timeskip happens, however; things begin to sour. We are once again greeted with the super comedic, one-dimensional parodies of Goku and Vegeta, as well as all the other characters that have become jokes thanks to their writing in DBS. (Think of egghead style krillin vs. DBZ krillin artstyle)Apparently Bulma has been collecting the dragon balls to wish herself 5 years younger. Why not even younger than that? Well she doesn't want people thinking she got plastic surgery. And why does Frieza want the Dragonballs? I can tell you it's not for immorality. Any guesses?.................. Wrong. He wants to increase his height by 5 cms. Why not taller? Well he wants people to think he's still growing. Yeah, it's dumb. And the dialogie for everything beyond this point is just rather cringey.Ever wanted to be treated to Vegeta yelling at Goku for the obsurdity of the fusion dance. Watch him pull an awkward ""dance move"" while yelling at him in this masterpiece. In fact expect Vegeta to do few things out of character in this.You get the point on the cringe. Let's move on.CGI is utilized yet again in this movie, sometimes for the best, othertimes its so off that it takes you out of the immersive experience. It's best when used on landscapes and power beams but it's simply distracting and awkward on characters. Instead of an actual score for the music, the Japanese have decided for a narrator to just be chanting the name of the last person to power up. More cringe. People were actually laughing out loud at this.POV shots during fight scenes were utilized rather well, giving you a sense of the flight and battle while not taking up too much time during what turned out to be the longest fight in DB movie history.The choreography was pretty decent for what you could see when the cinematographers didn't insist on using the ""shake effect"", making it harder to follow what was already a hard to follow fight. I was quite perturbed by this in fact, as well as many shots of fists flying followed by shots a closeup impact on someone's face(i.e. indicating lazy animation). For all intents and purposes I think they have run out of ideas on making a fight more epic than Goku vs Jiren and have opted to just throw any and all animation styles at you. It comes across as doing too much and the obsurdity of it all took me out of it yet again. In fact during the GogetavBroly fight, they seem too break into some pseudo alter dimension, as if this now gives them an excuse to use even crazier animation.In fact, the introduction and transformation into Gogeta is completely out of the blue, rushed, and lazily foreshadowed(if you can call it that). And it's at this point of the movie you start to realize that it's the fourth or fifth time the creators have added in something as almost a wink to the audience(not referring to gogeta).The writers actually gave us a significant amount of time learning about Broly as a person. It was a very good inclusion and I greatly enjoyed what they did with this incarnation, but when your two main characters are arguably the worst parts of the movie it's tough to call it the Greatest of all time. Anyway, go see it for yourself, whether you agree with me or think it should be #1 on Imdb I'm sure you will have a decent time regardless.","

From the art style to the perfectly animated fights dragon ball super broly has improved the fights they couldn't in the tv show and now feels more smoother than it was in the tv show.

"nickraman-27699","18 January 2019","Its been 9 months since we last saw Goku and the Z-fighters on screen (as of this writing, the dub is roughly near the start of the Tournament of Power saga.) These 9 months left DB fans restless and anxious as the previous DB films (later retconned into the Super's Beerus/Resurrection F sagas.)Sure Battle of Gods & Resurrection F were solid fan serviced films because of the franchise's dub reputation, but were they really great DB films? The last DB film I enjoyed was Fusion Reborn and that wasn't in-universe canon as was many of the Z films.But coming back to Super's take on Broly, its the best DB movie that actually beefs up (pun unintended) Broly's backstory instead of limiting him to a 1-note antagonist. Here, its refreshing to see the makers retell the origins story of the triad saiyan warriors (Goku/Vegeta/Broly) and their bout with Frieza (some carryovers from the Bardock Z special are adeptly left-in but hey, it works. ) It's also refreshing not hearing ""Kakarott"" grunted by Broly every 5 minutes in this as opposed to the 8th movie (yes, that film and their ""sequels"" have not aged well despite being ""a DB film, chuck your logic at the door excuse.)Its really nice having Vegeta get first dibs on battling Broly at the start, something the series lacked in before. Also, the pace is frantic without loitering around in stare downs and verbal diarrhea our characters are infamous for. The incredible special mention goes to Naohiro Shintani's art and animation work. Yamamuro's design were not a sight for these eyes. Not only do the fight movements look seamless and glorious visually, but it seems the production was able to keep it consistent throughout (as opposed to Yamamuro's dimensional take on the heroes marred with many shades of color. The shades seen here are fitting given the Z-manga style of keeping-it-simple-stupid.)The surprise fusion finale was fitting and smart of Toei/Toriyama to pack in given how Broly is a popular character in the west (as of this writing, this limited Eng dub release made 7 million on opening day. Thats the third highest since Resurrection F's lifetime here (8 million).) The open-ended finale of Broly sure gives hope that Goku may need to call should the need arise.Any blemishes? The origin retcon retelling of the saiyan races (particularly Goku's departure to Earth) feels a bit iffy now but given's Toriyama's lack of memory, it may be a bitter pill to swallow for fans.Still, the money coming in Japan & its limited run worldwide, DB is certainly not dead. Given the roller coaster of the word ""hiatus"" being tossed around in the past year, its a matter of time before DBS returns to airwaves. Preferably with Shintani helming the shows new direction.Any day now Toei. We're waiting.","

Now we have a true origin story for the Ledgendary Super Sayjan. That, mixed with seeing an even darker Freeza, in my opinion is what makes this the best movie in the franchise to date.

You WILL care about the Broly character and what he has endure since his exile.Akira Toriyama manage to give the proper place not just to the origin of the franchise but to Broly himself, not as an evil killing machine but more of a result of the terrible circumstances of his childhood.The soundtrack of this film is superb as well, hitting all the good notes where they need to, in the drama and the action scenes the music just felt right.This is a great film for Fans and definitely Newcomers who have no idea where the Saiyans come from or what fuzz is about.As a big fan who owns a big part of their classic films i can say without a shadow of a doubt, this is their BEST WORK!","

"SuperSlim451","19 January 2019","Broly has returned and this movie delivers on all fronts. It has the humor that you would expect from the series. Goku has his moments when he shows he isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. The story is actually engaging and the fight sequence is amazing.In the first Broly movie that turned into a trilogy it was said that Broly didn't like Kakarot because as a baby he was crying. That was the extent and it made Broly look like a mindless brute. This time he has a real story that makes sense. A story, a background that is actually pretty sad. And it went in a bit more depth about Goku's history and even Vegeta.The animation is gorgeous. Especially during the fight. It will keep you on the edge of your seat as you're wondering how each are going to overcome what's going to happen next. Frieza is just a classic villain. Just funny. Feels natural.I will say the movie isn't perfect because it isn't... but it is as good as any other animated movie I've seen in years. And this movie definitely tops all Dragon Ball movies made. Definitely worth the watch.","

"DJPilkington","19 March 2019","Back in 2013 when the Dragon Ball renaissance began with the release of the ""Battle of Gods"" movie, few anticipated that the franchise would continue to achieve such heights of quality half a decade later. While fans have expressed doubt during the at-times spotty run of the ""Dragon Ball Super"" anime continuation, ""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" brings the passion and excitement to new heights and proves that the ageing shonen franchise still has steam.As the film's title flatly implies, this is very much Broly's movie. But fear not! Gone is the monosyllabic psychopath of the old Toei Anime Fair movies, replaced with a nuanced, sympathetic and well-developed reimagining of the character. While still possessing a fiery temper, this Broly is a compassionate and misunderstood figure whose isolated upbringing exiled on the inhospitable planet Vampa with only his overbearing, vengeance-crazed father Paragus for company has made him emotionally stunted and vulnerable to manipulation. Broly is effectively built up as the true protagonist of the film that we end up rooting for. In many ways, Broly reflects what Goku would be like if he had never left the forest as a kid -- Broly even gets his own quirky supporting cast in Chirai and Lemo.The animation, fight choreography and art style of the film are all perfect. Everything is so fluid, colourful and exciting to watch thanks to Shintani's new art direction, giving a fresh take on the early DBZ style. In the best possible way, it's sometimes so fast-paced that you can barely make out what's going on, but these guys are meant to be millions of times faster than the speed of light after all.""Dragon Ball Super"" mixed the high-flying power fighting of DBZ with the comedic lightheartedness of the original DB series to varying degrees of effectiveness, but ""Broly"" has the perfect mix of both. While some might scoff at the idea of Frieza being reduced to a comic relief villain, I personally find it hilarious and it makes sense seeing as how DBS's last arc had him team up with the Z-Fighters. Goku and Vegeta play surprisingly minor roles in the film, but the build-up to the canon debut of their mighty fused form, Gogeta, is epic. Both of them also get plenty of funny moments to contrast their laidback lifestyle against Broly's life of hardship.""Broly"" isn't quiiiite perfect; the introductory backstory of Paragus, Broly and Frieza's destruction of planet Vegeta is handled brilliantly for the most part, but including as well Bardock feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. It feels as though there was meant to be an additional character arc for Goku coming to terms with his Saiyan heritage that ends up feeling a little half-baked -- it would've been perfect if Goku had somehow discovered some information about his parents that causes him to question his previous notions about them. Maybe one day Toriyama will release his full 3 hour long (!!) script draft and that will shed some light. But overall, ""Broly"" is a fantastic, fantastic movie that's nostalgic enough for longtime fans and accessible enough for newcomers.","

"pedropittss","14 April 2022","For those who say Dragon Ball has no story and is too shallow, this film shows the magnitude of the anime mythology about a warrior race that was decimated by a tyrant. From the very first scene on Planet Vegeta you realize how the creators wanted to give the fans a story worthy of such intense battles, and put intense ones at that! Every frame of this animation has a detail, every aspect of the fights has a meaning. This movie also turned a lot of things into canon that were not official, and it's something that the Dragon Ball Super series itself has been doing. A film at the height of Dragon Ball, with characters that we are passionate about and new ones that we have already gained respect for. Congratulations TOEI.","

CGI and other special effects were well executed and brought a ton of flavor to the film along with the fight scenes themselves. If you are wanting a movie that strictly highlights the awesome duo of Goku and Vegeta then this is the movie for you! Best Dragon Ball movie yet.

From what I gather, one chick wants the dragon balls to be five years younger and the evil chick wants to be taller so they all fight over it at the last hour. I appreciate the art style and the fight scenes look spectacular for a cartoon. This was made purely for the fans and it shows.

The animation in this film was astounding, you can feel the thuds with every blow, and the backstory (while aspects were retconned) provided the all important context without making you feel like you want to skip to the DragonBall we all know and love.This film has masterfully muscled its way to the top of many charts, and rightfully so.

Story 8/10
The story is pretty amazing by dragon ball standards. It is simple yet interesting and well written. The only problem I had was that the story could have been fleshed out more and It also felt like the movie wanted to do more but couldn't because of the limited time and because Toriyama-sensei's script was shrunk from 3 hours to approximately 1hr and 45 Minutes
Art 10/10
Pure sakuga !!!! but CGI seems out of place sometimes(doesnt match the 2d animation). I have seen reviews saying that this style is way too old and seems like an old Ghibli movie but they are stupid, The art is amazing, The camera movement, Its Amazing!!! This is the best piece of work Toei has ever animated and I am not even exaggerating because most Toei's work is pretty....You get my point. (cough cough One Piece,DB Super cough cough)
Sound 9/10
Very Well Composed, Absolutely Amazing! Though the wrestling announcer chants were weird but now they are growing on me after watching the movie 3 times!!! The sound effects for punches and energy blasts were so impactful!

Freize like always pulls menacing strings.The Story and the Production Overview:The last Dragon Ball product I seen was the final few episodes of the tournement saga featuring Jiren a few years ago. Now here I am Watching Broly. Truely there is only 10% story. When you thought you were going to get a story, its 90% fighting that was cool at the beginning, it dragged on and it lost me near the mid end.The action and animation is completely fine no doubt. The overdone fighting was the problem.Nevertheless, it was great to sit through another Dragon Ball moment like old times.Highlight:The fight scenes and the orgin story.

"lockout-59506","10 May 2022","For anyone who has been watching dragon ball since its inception you would know that the Broly story has already been done and Goku / Vegeta have already fought him durring the Z era. Reintroducing Broly as someone the Z fighters don't know is kind of weird and doesn't make much sense.Lets all be honest, Dragon Ball Z was pretty much the last good series from the dragon ball universe. GT felt rushed and more like a cash in on the popularity attempt more than anything. Everything after that was near unwatchable. I thought maybe this was going to be a remade version of the two Broly movies from the 90s into a single movie with enhanced art and was disappointed when I realized it wasnt. The only reason I gave this a shot was due to the highly rated reviews. Now that I have reread then I think most are fake. Many use the same phrase ""best dbz movie ever"" yet this isn't in the DBZ era. So either these people are bots or they dont know anything about the dragon ball series.When the saiyans first turned into SSJ in the Z series it was awesome! Here comes a legendary warrior not seen in the galaxy for thousands of years. Then another SSJ and another until it became common place and it kind of dumbed down the whole idea. Especially after they kept exceeding the level until they reached some type of God SSJ and even exceeded that.It seems as if the series is going to keep radically changing their hair color calling it a new plateau with more power but it honestly doesnt feel like more, just something different and uninteresting more than anythingAt least their keeping up with the rest of the film industry, constantly remaking or cashing in on top name franchises with mediocre to garbage film releases. I couldnt even finish this movie. There is honestly little to no story except in the first couple minutes but it never seemed to proceed. The animations were ok but nothing to write home about. Frieza sounds different and Bulma sounds different and neither in a good way. Also the fusion nonsense towads the end (when I turned it off) was all nonsense. First vegeta acts like he has no idea what fusion is or like he has ever seen the dance and then they go on to fail the fusion dance literally making the same exact mistakes trunks ans goten did during the cell saga resulting in a fat and then an ultra skinny fighter that were both useless. The level of unoriginality made my brain hurtIf you are a true fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stay away from this mess and watch some of the original dragon ball and dbz series tv shows an movies.","

"JayWolfgramm","12 March 2023","Broly as a character always seemed interesting in concept. Not just an evil super saiyan, but the super saiyan of legend. But all, and I do mean ALL previous movies with the character failed to make him interesting. In all three of his previous movies he would just run around shouting ""Kakarot"" and smashing things up. Pretty much like the Hulk but without any solid alter ego. This movie takes those lemons and makes Lemonade.This is Broly's best movie. They do change a bit of continuity for him, and it is for the better. This time around, Broly is basically a Tarzan. He has been raised in a wild environment and has had to get stronger from necessity to survive on that planet. He hasn't been trained to fight, but all the strength is there. His motivation this time around also makes more sense. Instead of being mad at Goku for crying next to him as a baby, he is mad at Vegeta because his father tried to have him, and his father killed. That is a far more compelling motive.Not only is this Broly's best movie, it is Bardock's best movie. A good portion of this movie is devoted to reintroducing fans to the backstory of three different Saiyans: Goku, Vegeta and Broly. In order to do that, the movie flashes back to planet Vegeta and shows the situation befoe Frieza fully takes over and does his thing. This does age up Goku and makes his back story a little too identical to Superman but I am OK with that.The movie certainly has a pacing issue. Most of the first half is exposition, set up and character growth. Not a typical first half for a Dragon Ball movie, but a welcome change of pace. The movie is like reading a book and then watching a fireworks show. A lot of character stuff and then all at once explosion after explosion.Frieza is here as well and has some all-time great moments working off of Broly and Paragus. Cheelai and Lime are the best new characters introduced in the series since Beerus and Whis. Cheelai and Broly have a real Tarzan and Jane feel to them.It is a different animation style than the show and sometimes that works for its benefit, but other times the animation quality seems to really drop. I also don't care for the music that does nothing but chant the characters names over and over again.All in all, this is a real solid entry into the Dragon Ball movie universe. So good that I can't wait for it to be folded into the series proper. Not just a good Dragon Ball movie, but a good animated movie in general. It is deserving of the title of ""Super"".","

"njasis","18 January 2019","I loved the animation and action in this movie. The characters are fleshed out enough for those who have seen Dragon Ball before, and if you haven't seen Dragon Ball you can still enjoy the movie. The main characters are likeable, and the villain is also quite interesting. There are good guys and there are bad guys, but also someone in between, which makes it all so much more interesting to watch. The fights are awesome, with spectacular animation though of course it can always be better. The artstyle resembles the original series, and the music has some nice tunes here and there that builds up the tense moments. This is one of the things that the movie should have more of - tense moments. Since it""s only 1 hour 30 minutes long the movie feels kinda rushed and thus lacks some dragged out scenes that could have made the moments even more epic. Even the story feels a bit rushed though they did a really good job to explain Brolys background. And who knows, there might be a second movie some day. All in all the positives outshines the rest which makes the movie a great one to watch. A must see for action and anime fans.","

"gavinp9","24 January 2019","'Dragon Ball Super: Broly' is a sequel/continuation/reboot of the 'Dragon Ball' TV series and the two most recent films, 'Battle of Gods' and 'Resurrection F'. Like those, it's like slipping back into comfy pajamas - Goku (Schemmel)'s still funny and righteous, Vegeta (Sabat)'s still got a chip on his shoulder and Frieza (Ayers) is still out for universal domination. Starts with a good backstory of the Saiyans on their planet and how/why Broly (Mignogna) and his father, Paragus (Clarke) are exiled.Not much for secondary characters to do, but we still see Trunks, Bulma, Beerus and Piccolo. Once we've established Frieza's hand in turning Broly bad and bringing them to Earth, it's up to Goku and Vegeta to stop the 'legendary Super Saiyan'. From there, it's pretty much a massive battle scene for the final 30min.As in the series and films, there animation is excellent, the soundtrack's fast, there's plenty of ""powering-up"" and close-ups and enough jokes thrown in to provide levity. It's fun to see new levels of 'Super Saiyan' and their respective colours and the changes in fighting styles these bring. Nothing groundbreaking, but a good ending and decent story.","

"MovieRiffing","15 July 2019","One would hope that on the second attempt of telling Broly's origin story all of the kinks would be ironed out. Unfortunately, this new entry brings issues of its own. Instead of silly (but somewhat charming) narrative devices bogging down the story, this time truly dreadful CGI ruins the final showdown. Interrupting beautiful 2D animation with underfunded 3D efforts has become commonplace in modern anime, and Dragon Ball Super: Broly got hit square in the face.","

"datautisticgamer-74853","25 January 2019","As someone who watched the entirety of TFS's abridged Dragon Ball Z, I guess I could consider myself an on-and-off fan of the Dragon Ball franchise. For that reason, I was near-captivated by the thought of seeing this movie at my local AMC. My (brief) opinion?At times, the plot felt a little too eager to get to the action scenes, though the action is trademark Dragon Ball: with well-crafted effects and general unpredictability, the animation really helps bring out the action scenes. The writing is occasionally hilarious, but mostly it does a fine job of developing its ""new"" characters. Unfortunately, it doesn't really develop Goku, Vegeta, or some of the other returning characters, as if Toei assumed the audience knew who they were. But that's the thing about anime films like this; they were made for fans. So while it is understandable where Toei was going, it still would have been nice to see a brief time lapse of how other characters like Bulma came to be where they are in the film.For casual audiences, this may very well be worth your time with its action, surprisingly wonderful animation, and insightful backstories on Broly, Paragus, and a few others. For families, do keep in mind that since it's a Funimation dub, they kept most of the language and violence intact from the original Japanese version. On the other hand, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this film if you are a Dragon Ball fan. Hey, at least it's better than Evolution, right?","

"Brevin_Campbell","10 February 2019","When it comes to Japanese animation the franchise of Dragon Ball is probably one of the biggest if not already the most massive. The series, Dragon Ball Z, ran on television from 1996-2003 across 291 episodes and was a cultural phenomenon. The series has sense had a total of 15 movies and loads of merchandising. It was no surprise to most fans of japanese cartoons that the film managed to land in the top 5 making 11 million dollars domestically. (Box Office Mojo) The film does quite a lot to please both old fans and new ones. And in comparison to the older film Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan this film is not only surpasses it but create a more compelling narrative. It does this with its more compelling characters and backstories for this universe.The film starts out by giving us a bit of backstory on not only the enemy but the world that the Dragon Ball Universe inhabits as it gives us the history on a alien race called ""Saiyans"" or ""Saiyajin""for the japanese audience. It talks about a tyrannical ruler named Frieza who becomes the ruler of this planet of saiyans after their father, King Cold, grants them this authority. This entire halve allows people who have never watched Dragon Ball before to have more of a clear idea of what is going on in the film. Allowing the viewer to get a strong sense for what this franchise is all about. It however also changes the lore up for old fans so that way they stay entertained throughout this first halve by giving us new characters such as the main character, Goku, having a mother, or giving us a better idea of how the saiyan race tends to operate.But what makes the Dragon Ball movie truly more sophisticated than the simple brawls that the series has been known for is its deep dive into its main antagonist, Broly, who is given a rich and complex backstory that will leave many non fans quite impressed as the film attempts to pull on your heart strings. It is probably one of the few times that the writer, Akira Toriyama, has attempted to create such a interesting character. If you look at the original film Broly is much more of this one note brute who only says ""Kakarot"" over and over, and is simply used as a plot device who the heroes must defeat, but here Broly is a person who has been forced into battle by his father, but we see scenes in the film that Broly doesn't want to fight for his dad, and would rather live a more peaceful life. These are aspects of Broly that really help us understand the character being crafted on screen. The film also gives us some new additions like Cheelai who ends up being a pretty great new addition to the rest of the cast and plays a prominent role in Broly's character development. There is a scene between Broly and her when they are at a cafeteria in which Cheelai takes interest and Broly and shows that she finds herself caring a lot for the brute even being willing to protect him.
Now the film is still at the end of the day a Dragon Ball film and because of that there is still a big action fight in the 3rd act and its pretty great, but unlike the action scenes in previous Dragon Ball films this act has more weight to it because you care about the character involved. This gives the action more weight in the big explosive battle.The animation in the final fight also looks incredibly beautiful. When you see the main character and Broly going at each other you can't help but get immersed in the fight and take in all the action. Your eyes wander throughout the screen trying to take in every color change, every deviation of position of the characters, and it becomes both overwhelming but also engaging in a way that allows you to have a clear understanding of what each character is doing, and for that reason alone it is extremely entertaining.There are some areas of the film were the animation dropped in quality mainly for the more comedic moments during the action halve. It was obvious a decent amount of the budget had to go the main character and antagonist punching each other and because of that everything going on around the fight had to be have its quality diminished which was quite disappointing for me as a fan. And while the fights were cool to look at it and the backstory does help them it is a very extensive fight. The movie is 1 hour and 41 mins and the fight takes up pretty much the entire 41 minutes. And it actually ends up being quite glorious the way they manage it. And I must give the director, Tatsuya Nagamine, a lot of props for managing to pull something like this off because it couldn't have been easy.In conclusion Dragon Ball Super: Broly works pretty well as a Dragon Ball film, and even manages to break some expectations giving us a more complex antagonist with a rich and endearing backstory to go along with it. The animation isn't always perfect and the action long winded, but is a great and enjoyable time at the theater and one that I feels really works in spades. And rather you are a new fan or a older one both groups will get something from it.","

"Stefan_Loves_Movies","13 February 2022","Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018) is an Animation/Action/Adventure DBZ movie, 1h40m long, directed by Tatsuya Nagamine. It's a remake of the original (1993) version. I think this is as good as the Broly concept can go. This version (2018) of the movie is clearly better than the original. It finally feels like a compelling story. The only thing that bothered me: the fighting scenes were WAY TOO LONG.Conclusion: Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018) isn't a perfect movie, but it's a step in the right direction. Despite its flaws, I had a good time with it! 7-8/10 stars!","

But without a doubt what was the best in this movie was gogeta legendary fusion of Goku and Vegeta the fight between him and Broly was amazing
the animation
The music
It was fantastic
There was only one thing that bothered me about the movie and that was the plot, it wasn't that much of a plot, but it doesn't matter

"NDbportmanfan","17 February 2019","Having watched the two back to back; I can safety say this one is better. The problem I had with the original is that they tried to incorporate too many characters into the battles. 1993 had 8 while the new version just had the main two on the battlefield. That leaves plenty of time to actually tell Broly's story in a meaningful way. Which is done fantastically I might add as the flashbacks even help new viewers understand the lore.The fight scenes are very long but the visuals are so amazing that I certainly lost track of time as I was marveling at the beauty. I also was happy with Broly's power growth throughout the film as it felt more realistic than the original movie.What I didn't like about it was a lot of the jokes. I know Goku is the comic relief of the series but I do not enjoy when other characters like Frieza act goofier than him.This movie revitalized my love for the series (It died off after watching GT) and I am excited to see the other movies connected to the Super series.","

"Ido_Fong_Wong","21 January 2019","Let me start by saying that yes the animation was phenomenal and the movie looked very polished, but it wasn't perfect. The use of CGI at some part the beauty they had established, although it seemed used for useless details so it wasn't too bad.As far as I'm concerned everything else goes down from there.. The story was a rehash of the original Broly movie so that point is moot they could've done anything since that's what Super seems to stand for. The story held almost completely and with very few plot holes. However I cannot tell if it was cannon with the rest of the Super series.The characters seems only like total parodies of themselves outside of the fights, but far less intelligently handled than previous iterations of the story. They seemed dumb as rocks and far too accepting for their own good.Now the music I don't know if it that was part of the localisation but it was simply horrible. Adding the name of the characters in it does not make it music, and that is only pointing out one element. Either the series have lost their touch since Super or as always localisation plays a big role.The voice acting or most likely the mixing was also very lackluster. Some of the dialogs were being buried in louder well inserted music/sound effects and they were likely important, but I can't tell because I couldn't hear them so much it was soft spoken. If I had to point out the worst one it would be Frieza.All in all, it is a very entertaining movie, but I wouldn't have needed to see this on a big screen, or at all.","

"daphnebiatchie","28 January 2019","Alright, I'm from the generation that watched dbz on cartoon network when i was just a kid. I watched the Broly movie years later then, and I loved them (well, the first one anyways, the second one was okay'ish)From that point of view, I have to say... it's not the same broly,
he looks the same, at some point, and yes, the story behind him is a bit better,
but all that made Broly Legendary, isn't there.What made ""old Broly"" great, was that he was a brute, unstoppable, vicious and just mocked his opponents efforts with a grin and a devastating counter attack.That Broly isnt there in this movie, and if I'm honest, the first part of the movie, the flashback, that part was great, excellent even, but the fight and ""whole idea about broly"" , it just feels like a way too long friendly practice fight.
it doesnt seem like anyone is ever getting desperate, Brolly is powering up to stand a chance against ""the good guys', instead of the other way around.The animation is top of the shelf though, music is good, voice acting..reasonable good, nothing particulary good or bad, just DBZ.I liked it, but hoped for better, and well... there wasnt anything at stake, so there never was any tension building up.
I hoped to see Broly, but it felt more like..Goku vs ""super annoyed Goku""Go watch it if you're a hardcore fan, or just curious, otherwise...dont trust ratings that give max stars for this imho","

"TristanSilya","22 January 2019","Although I am a big Dragon Ball fan I went into this movie with no expectations except for expecting to see some cool animations and good fight scenes. This is so I can rate the movie with as least bias as possible.I believe if you're completely new then it may be a very shallow and confusing movie and the only thing that might do it for you is the animation and fights.Pros:Animation is very fun, exciting, and refreshing to watch.Gogeta looks amazing with all the blue effect and auras.Sound does a great job at conveying how strong and powerful the moves and hits and blasts are.Backstory helped set up the narrative and fights a little (more later).Has decent funny moments.
Cons:A little too much screaming, even for Broly. A few times in I was shaking my head and thinking, ""okay, I get it, they're overdoing it with the screaming."" Yes, it's Dragon Ball, they do that a LOT and they still overdid it here.When Goku was getting ""Broly Smashed"" in red form he was screaming like he was getting murdered although he sort of just let it happen. It did show that Broly was strong but it also showed how unnecessary Goku can be for no reason when we all know he can go blue form and prevent wasting time and taking a ton of damage for no reason.The last bit was pertaining to Broly. He was introduced as a very strong and loving boy who respects his dad and wants to protect Cheelai when she was getting bullied. He also explains how he made friends with a creature and how he wears it's ear as a sentimental piece. But they also push him as a brute, merciless, killing machine that has no self-control if he gets mad. During his fight he literally became an entirely different person, completely. Yes, he was strong but at the same time it felt like the Broly that we saw throughout the whole movie wasn't there. The explanation was that his dad, Paragus, raised him to be that way. If that were the case then he would also be a jerk when he is calm. Instead, he is a nice, honorable, caring and sentimental person until he fights and he transforms into a merciless monster that would hurt bystanders and innocent people as seen when he tries to attack Frieza (as far as he knew Frieza didn't do anything evil) and Whis for being in the way even though Goku/Vegeta were his main opponent. The fight DID start because he wanted to get revenge for being abandoned by King Vegeta but quickly turned into something more and entirely different. I wish they gave Broly a little more motive and control during the fight to give it a little more meaning and purpose.Some of the jokes were a little cringe-worthy and was a bit forced. One example is when Goku asked for a definition of a word right before a fight. I didn't like the break of tension that it did for me and wanted to hold on to the tension that was built up.","

"mattlewisnati","29 January 2020","The character animation style is amazing! The fights are intense! This movie will keep you captivated for exactly what it was made for, pure DB action and it excels at that.My only complaint is the character power levels.SS Vegeta should have been contested at Broly base. SS2 Vegeta contested at SS Broly. SSG Vegeta being dominant. SSB Vegeta being completely overpowering.SS Goku should have been contested at Broly base. SS2 Goku contested at SS Broly. SS3 Goku being dominant. SSG Goku being completely overpowering.Frieza base should have been contested and dominant with Broly base and SS Broly. Golden Frieza being completely overpowering.To downplay the battle history, experience and power gains of Vegeta, Goku and Frieza is just disrespectful to the whole franchise. And to compare him to the power of Beerus was also disrespectful. Using SSG and SSB for the sake of fan service was out of line. Even we know better.","

"ebrailey22","19 January 2019","Been a fan of dbz since i was atleast 10 or 11. This is the best movie of the series. Awesome cinematic look and re imagining of Frieza destroying planet Vegeta and Brolys upbringing. You see more of saiyan culture, and an inside look of how Friezas race took over theirs. Can't wait to watch it again. Only slight downfall or reason I'm not giving 10 was because of the music","

"rueryuzakil","1 February 2019","As far as the Dragon Ball movie criteria goes, Dragon Ball Super Broly fits it pretty well. The fight scenes are fast-paced, climactic and very impressive, and we are shown certain things we've never witnessed before in this franchise. There are plenty of comic relief moments strewn throughout the film, far more than I personally expected, which ended up being a double-edged sword for me.It's difficult to give a spoiler free review, so the oncoming things may(?) be spoilers? So proceed at your own risk.Some of the comedy seemed very out of place to me. Some of them were intimately intertwined with the premise(like Frieza's wish) and just seemed unnecessary to me because it removed the long-term tension(the tension outside of fights). There were some cases of out-of-character moments, at least to me. Another one, and I'm probably nitpicking here, is an aspect of the animation, the character's micro expressions. The new style is amazing and very fluid, but the characters seem to gesticulate too much in a typical anime manner which just makes them look comical and unrealistic. It's like the animators are doing their best to showboat.Characters who were heavily promoted barely show up at all. This includes the likes of Beerus, Goten, Trunks, Paragus and Whis. You shouldn't expect any action from Beerus, who remains grossly underappreciated, and Gotenks, who doesn't show up at all.Now, the story. It is far inferior to its two predecessors. Plot holes, premature character development and power inconsistencies are all there. Some might even be considered copouts. Fight scenes are the driving strengths of this movie.However, Broly, himself, is a very good character. Believe me, I absolutely despised the original Broly and was sick of his notoriety in the fan base, but this new, canon rendition is a much, much better change of pace. Even if you haven't seen the old movies, I have a feeling you're likely to take a liking to him.Finally, this movie tries hard to emulate the ones bearing the old renditions of the new characters. Fusion Reborn, Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan and Bardock, the Father of Goku. While it succeeds in a few scenes, the rest are just painful. Especially if you haven't seen the three above mentioned, these moments will just seem pointless to you. As for voice acting, the staple DB cast does a great job as always, while Vic Mignogna makes a triumphant return as Broly, breathing new life into the character.Now, that's my review. Had I not watched all five trailers, the three classics or expected a stronger story, I might have given this movie a slightly higher ranking. However, it would not have made my Top 10 Dragon Ball movies list.","

"guaridainrikku","24 March 2019","Back in the early 90s i remember me as a little kid being glued to the tv, watching Dragon Ball, then growing up with these series as they evolve. Seeing this movie brought back all the nostalgia and the memories, this is really a diamond to look at in awe, the animation in this movie is so well made, looks so fluent and detailed. It has reignited the kid in me, being glued to the screen and wishing to be in that universe to join its battles. Being now an 29 years old adult, sitting in my chair, wobbling from one side to the other at the theatres, trying not to yell at the screen ""C'mon, let them have it"", i really felt as if i was back to the 5 years old me, cheering for Goku to kick those butts.

The movie shows the backstory of planet Vegeta and its subsequent destruction by that damned Lizard (Frieza).

"yourtamim","30 January 2019","Well as we all waited so long for the movie,let's take some deeper look into it.Bad Drawing-
As you've seen Broly movie was a piece of bad and lazy drawing.A well developed drawing was missing from the whole movie,surprising!
I'll blame Toei production for repeating this kind of mistakes even in their movies.It's a shame for a big production like Toei for doing such thing.Bad story line-
Well I wasn't surprised at all cause I was expecting this to be happen.
Literally I couldn't found a strong plot and any depth in the story.That Bardock sequence was so boring that I almost closed my eyes for a nap.Like seriously? That was Goku's father!! Where is the hype! where is the damn thrill thinking about it. I can remember when I was a kid how much excited I was to see gokus father.But when this non-canon fairy tail actually came into reality.I was disappointed seriously. and I'm not the only one who've been missing good story line from the time of Boo saga.absurd jokes-
Like seriously? Frieza wants those dragon balls to increase His heights?
The way of throwing these jokes were awful as hell.only that fusion part was funny.
*It's not comedy if you feel annoyed of it*well only the good part maybe was those fighting scenes.Toei worked hard for that for sure. I dunno but expected a lot more as we've waited more than 10 months for that thing to come and can't remember how much freaking years for
Broly to take part in main story line.
well umm
I felt like it was nothing but a 1h 41m special episode that Toei used to broadcast in every week.
I am disappointed as hell btw.*coffee time*","

There's barely any story here, the last 45 minutes is one extended fight scene, and without a good story driving the fight scenes, they get boring fast. I think if it had been a little shorter, it would've been easier to watch.","

"afenixmusic","28 December 2020","I just watched it and this was the most regressive that Dragon Ball has ever been.
They dumbed down all of the characters so much it's just heartbreaking.
Goku just wants to get stronger. Vegeta just wants to get it over with. Piccolo is just there to teach them one basic move. Frieza is there just because. And the saddest part is Broly and Paragus - they've completely been stripped of any motivation behind their actions and just been deduced to ""we're just here for the revenge hurr durr"" plot.
In the 1993 movie Paragus has come up with this elaborate revenge plan, to trick Vegeta into rebuilding the Saiyan race. He has clear motivations, a unique twist to his actions and interesting dialogue which brings a lot of weight to his character. Now the motivations are sort-of the same, but the way he achieves his plans is just pathetic and disrespectful to the legacy of the character to say the least. His arch ends so abruptly that you just stop caring for him and that is very sad.
Broly as well, has been deduced from an all-out menacing galaxy destroying killing machine to a vegetable who blindly follows wherever you point your finger at. You can argue that his arch of him growing up helps to flesh out his character, but I'm sorry - playing with fluffy dogs is not how you build a villain. The original Broly had true-felt hatred sown deep inside of him and his every hit blown towards the main characters carried that hatred. Now, it's as I mentioned - ""Imma hit this guy because I'm told to"".
The animations are basically the same quality as in the 1993 film, and I'd like to stress this - it came out 25 years before this 'remake'. Albeit in this film they're in slightly higher frame rate. But the overall quality of animations is as expected from a modern animated film and are still what I'd consider as average.
The character design also suffered a downgrade. Paragus, from a military leader was deduced to a simple servant. And Broly - his unique world-bending color-shifting attacks which actually felt like they might blow up the entire world with a touch of a finger - are no longer there. The green aura remains, but it just feels so darn basic.
No feeling of hopelessness, no menacing aura, no feeling of unity - there are simply no stakes to make this story feel impactful.
Do yourself a favor, skip this movie and watch the original ""Dragon Ball Z Movie: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.","

"d_z-a","31 January 2019","Amazing movie, It truly did justice to the series and is the pinnacle of animation of this series. The battles were amazing and the art style was just absolutely beautiful and made the movie a true treat to watch!
However i did have some quirks with it.
Number one, They ditched the music for the fight scenes in favor of some ridiculous chanting. I was very annoyed at this but didnt take away a star since everything else was so well polished and i dont believe it deserves to be punished for this ( although it really should)
Second they made Brolly just a bit too strong from the start. He should have had to work a little harder to attain the power he got to , and the movie in turn felt a little rushed.
So in all honesty the movie actually deserves a 8.5/10 but it was such a treat in every other aspect that i feel obligated to give it a perfect 10/10!","

I enjoyed the story on planet Vegeta, the scenes with Bardock, etc., I really want to see more stuff about the average saiyans who are not the protagonists. The animation was beautiful, but the whole fight with Broly was kinda boring and it didn't have any weight at all. I miss those brutal injuries from Dragon Ball that horrified me as a kid, but they were neccessary because you knew the fighters really pushed themselves to their limits. Now there's just punches, kicks and more punches and while they sure look good on the screen, I just couldn't take the whole thing serious. The soundtrack was very cringy, it tries to be cool soo hard, but it's really just bloody awful. I think the old DBZ Broly is far superior to DBS Broly, I liked his character a lot more too in DBZ. He was just an uncontrollable embodiment of rage, which was truly terrifying, DBS Broly is not that scary at all. Overall, I think this movie is very overhyped, it had all those things I didn't like in the DBS series, and I really wish they could just go back to the roots, before super saiyan was even a thing.","

Luckily the fighting was the coolest i have seen from dragon ball. really epic fight animations. absolutely beautiful. But it was never that serious and the story never continued during the fighting. they just got the fighting over with and then had a mini ending. Thats why i only rate it 8 stars. I wish while they were fighting the story actually continued and was like a drama movie or something. but it was like okay the story got us to the fight scene, now we will have a couple epic fights but then the movie is basically over. the end characters including freeza and vegeta, didnt match the the story telling of those characters in the first 3rd of the movie. In the end freeza didnt even fight for real and was used like a side guy like yamcha. Maybe he is a side guy, but he doesnt know it! He should have been a little more angry or promising goku that he would get vengeance when he gets stronger or something. In the end he kind of like had this ""its cool, im a side character"" kind of vibe to him. maybe the movie needed 30 more min.","

"flavio_zanatta","6 January 2019","Since the release of the new DBS series I was so sad about the poor animation, the poor storyline, the horrible drawing traits, but this movie changed everything. At the same time made me afraid of what is coming for the future of Dragon ball. Are we going to keep up DBS with the same good level of the movie or are we going to go back to that awfull drawing and poor story?
Now about the movie I was definetelly impressed. Very well directed, they finally gave the whole context, well explained and very well animated. CGI was used in the right moments and throughout the movie I felt that feeling from DBZ and in the theather I went, the session was full, the vibe was absolutelly amazing, everybody was so happy to see Veggeta turning to Super Saying God and the fusion between them is just outstanding, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I felt pleased to see it and will be even happier if the tv series keep the same level of animation, like DBZ madjin boo saga. Totally worth watching.","

"dhall-38216","11 July 2019","I am a long time Dragon Ball fan, and as such, have seen most of if not all of the movies. This is not the best one so far, but still better than most. The writing is really solid, and it retcons Broly's origin story to make it much more engaging and believable.
There is a large exposition dump at the beginning so even people unfamiliar with the long history of the series can understand each character, but don't let it turn you off. They're written with clear motivations and it's a very simple but well told story. Again, credit to the writers for the story, even if some things are lost in translation.
My only big problems with it were with the animation and music/sound. The animation that is hand drawn is great as always, but the CGI ""enhancements"" were pretty obvious, but some were implemented very well. This problem is made worse by the extreme movement of the camera, as there is so much movement going on at times, I had no idea what was going on. When the characters are flying around in three dimensions and the camera is also swinging around aggressively, it makes me lose my bearings completely. It's similar to the fight scene in Battle of the Gods, when Beerus fights Goku with his new god powers, but it's poorly done and amplifies the already visually noisy action.
Speaking of noise, that's how I would describe the music. Some is really well done, like the choir being used at dramatic moments, but others made me physically cringe. It's cheesy enough that each character announces their attacks and stuff like that, but now each character has their name poorly incorporated into generic rock music during their action scenes. I'd love to be watching the fight, but hearing the characters' name being ""rock yelled"" in the music is very distracting. It happens for literally every character that powers up and fights. Imagine if it had some peaceful music with some dummy singing ""Piccollo..."" when they visit him in his quiet wasteland. Well the reality of what they did is just as stupid. The sound design could be better too, maybe give each strike and explosion a little more oomph.
Overall, it was entertaining and well written with a tight story, and though I would have liked to see more side characters, they would be pretty useless to the plot. The parts that were supposed to be exciting were lacking because of the disorienting camera work/animation style. As for the music, it may have just been the edit I watched and it's a pretty easy fix, but it was horrible. Get on that internet, make yourself useful!","

SPOILERS.The story is,in the base level, about goku and vegeta's fight against Broly.The good thing about the movie is it's action. it's obvious that no pennies were spared in making of the movie.The movie fails at it's story. Broly was raised by his father for revenge. Two soldiers took pity on him and wants to make him a free man. This sets up a recurring theme in the movie. The theme of brain washing. This theme even though touched is utterly ignored in favor of quickly going to the fighting scenes.The fighting scenes themselves are set up in a horrible way too. The ""epic fight"" starts with no warning. It starts with Broly walking in and the fight starting. The lack of ANY set up of the fight is a sight to behold.I would love to say something more but I can't, because this movie HAS NO STORY. It tries to tackle a heavy subject which deserves a story far longer than 1 Hour 44 minutes and far more than three people punching each other.","

"harish-8988","15 April 2022","I don't understand the positive reviews.All the progress that Broly story had made so far is lost in this movie.All the time goku and vegeta were fighting, frieza, cell, buu, beerus, tournament of power, etc. And Broly and father was stuck in a planet all this time?What happened to the old Broly, he was defeated by goku and vegeta, then resurrected again and again and now you are telling me that didn't happened.And I don't understand the power levels, Broly maybe a legendary super saiyan, but goku and vegeta are both super saiyan God and Broly can take them on in his normal form without even proper training and food?Just to remind you the scale, goku ssj3 defeated buu and buu was super strong. And now a super saiyan god, which is a step ahead of ssj3 can't defeat a saiyan?Not only ssj God, but Super Saiyan blue also can't defeat him.This doesn't make any sense.Instead someone could've used the dragonball to revive broly maintaining the original arc, and making broly more powerful than before.And what happened to Ssj3, it's not been used since buu. I think due to long hairs, the animators have to do some extra work, so the story now only includes transformations that change hair colors. It would be just easier to change the colors rather than change the hair length.DBZ was the best, super and it's stories doesn't feel like DBZ. Even when the characters are shown to surpass super saiyan levels and became a God they don't feel that powerful as it was shown in DBZ.I still remember when goku transformed into super saiyan for the first time. You can feel that he is much more stronger now.Now it's just they change hair color and that's it...It should be Dragonball Hair Colors rather than Super.","

With the extreme high score (almost 'everywhere') of this episode I was very looking forward to watch this movie, but all my expectations weren't fulfilled.The beginning of the story in this movie is a bit changed from the original story from the series, but it's not such a big deal. Broly looks physically also a bit different than what we used to, he has a scar on his cheek and chest and his jewelry is gone and replaced by a metal circle around his neck. (I have no idea why ?)The animations are (at some point) very well done, but sometimes also so badly (a bit like the DBS saga), like there are still drafts and there was not enough time to finish the movie 100%. The shading is sometimes also very poorly done. The 2D / 3D transitions are very obvious but it personally didn't bother me.The soundtrack would have been great if they have taken that ridiculous ""Go Broly Go"" and afterwards ""Go ... (somebody I won't mention) Go"" track out of it. (For a strange reason there has always be ""weird"" songs in the DB movies, with some not fitting metal / doom-metal tracks imho).The story is also very predictable (like in all the movies), but that's not a real negative point because it's always been like this. During the battle I find it pretty stupid how fast the environment could change, up to 3 times during the movie. I regret Goku isn't transforming into Ultra Instinct transformation like at the end of the Dragon Ball Super saga.It was enjoyable to watch but I preferred the penultimate episode of Dragon Ball Super or the ""Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan"" movie than this movie.","

This movie does contain spoilers for the Tournament of Champions arc of Super, but we all kind of figured what was going to happen with that!I don't think words can describe how amazing Dragon Ball Super: Broly truly is! With the updated animation everything was extremely crisp and beautifully done! Even Whis got in on some of the action! It was also lovely to meet Gokus mother and have a much softer look at Bardock. Unfortunately some fan favorites were missing, but that didn't detract from the experience at all! Overall I would go see this movie a million times in theater if I had the funds to do so! My boyfriend and I wanted to try to stay behind to catch another viewing, but no luck.GO SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!!","

"emir-adenaury","23 February 2019","Not a film for people who are watching Dragon Ball for the first time. The new story from Broly is quite interesting, very likely there will be a sequel to this film. The fighting scene was amazing, I couldn't ask for more than this. The use of some old school animation like a double-edged sword, old fans will probably like it, but not for people who have just watched Dragon Ball for the first time.","

"jerryprince","26 December 2018","I enjoyed this movie and loved the fighting scenes. Yet, like any other human beings I found three things which I didn't like.1) Story seems to be rushed
2) No Sense of tension (SSB Gogeta should have struggled against SSJ Full Power Broly but I know they're simply following the plot. )
3) Too short (would have loved to see 2 hour film tho)","

"drewgueit","12 July 2019","I am an avid DBZ fan so it pains me to say this, in this day and age, the story and fight scenes are simply not good enough! I know some people may not agree but I think the Broly story is a tired one. I would, at the very least like to see a refreshing story about Broly. He is a great character with so much potential, please write something new and captivating!
Now, the fight scenes! Just horrible & lazy! No combat structure to the choreography, just excessive zooming in and out, characters charging and posing with distracting lighting effects... and far too many zooms into screaming mouths!!!
There was no progression in the fight scenes! Just blow for blow.
What hope do we have for quality anime if people keep slapping on 10/10 for productions like this... Appalling!","

"masterarcan","31 May 2023","Not only they canonize Broly, giving him a better backstory than the old movie, they did so much more.The first part of the movie is set on planet Vegeta shortly before its destruction at the hands of Frieza, explaining the origins of Broly, also introducing, for the first time in a canonical way, King Vegeta, Bardock and his wife, making us quite an idea to what kind of characters they actually were. The second part, on the other hand, is set on Earth, roughly after the tournament of power, we'll see an enormously extended amount of fight scenes, where Gogeta will also make an appearance, finally becoming canon.The animation is really smooth and dynamic, best seen in a Dragon Ball movie, this time the 3D animation is well done.Personally, the best Dragon Ball movie so far.","

"dcpacker","1 February 2019","As someone who has grown up with Dragon Ball, I have enjoyed the many episodes and films that the franchise has offered over the decades, but this one takes the cake... Let me tell you why.The final fight is something to behold. As I was watching, I assumed a small scuffle was going to take place, with the final fight coming later on in the film. I was wrong! With amazing animation, a great soundtrack by Norihito Sumitomo, and powerful sound effects, we are treated to not only the best fight in the franchise (in my opinion), but also one of the best fights i've seen in anime in general. It kicks straight into high gear and just keeps getting more intense. I personally rate it up there with such great anime fight scenes as Ichigo versus Aizen in Bleach, and Kakashi versus Obito in Naruto Shippuden.If you're a dragon ball/anime fan and enjoy a good fight scene, this is a must see film.","

"matrixltu","5 February 2021","I don't know why people gave it 10 points. It's a very weak movie once the real action begins on earth. Goku and Vegeta feels very weak. Broly, who only fought bugs and big cats his whole life, is super strong in his normal form, while Goku and Vegeta, who fought the best fighters in whole universe - have big problems even in blue form. Whaaaat? The pace of the poweruping is absolutely unrealistic. It's like the writers skipped 20 episodes and fast-forwarded everything and copy-pasted small bits in-between. Even dialogues were worse than in db-gt during the whole fight. This movie is fun to watch and very well made the first 50 minutes or so and then it turned to utter mess. Nothing made sense. Motivations, powers, pacing, character thought process - very disjointed and childlishly made.
Animations were awesome though. Love the old-school look.","

"Ralph-Jordie","27 January 2019","Sorry to have to do this people, breaking up that amazing 10/10 streak this movie is on! But it simply is not worth 10 stars! It could have! It most certainly could have. But being the cynical (and critical) a-hole that I am.. Sorry!I'd like to start out that my girlfriend went with me completely voluntarily (nope) and enjoyed herself very much (that part IS true!).The reason that this movie is a 9 out of 10 is just me acting out against Akira for allowing some of the, what I like to call: dragonball super design work. Although dragonball super has made LEAPS when it comes down to designing it still has its scenes where you just wonder; WHY!?SAME HERE. Part of the CGI was a completely different style and made scenes look messy because it did not incorporate with the designing. Some scenes just had bad designing all together. WHY would you let that happen, Akira?It can't be money. I've seen better scenes in other animes with not even half the budget. If you're going to make a masterpiece, AND THIS MOVIE IS. You might as well go the extra mile a make sure everything is spot on!What I loved was the fact that they made Broly so vulnerable! He came to earth not even wanting to fight, not even being able to go super saiyan. And during each fight he just reaches level after level after level..Loved the saiyan prequel.. Loved that Vegeta finally got some decent recognition.. Loved the fights.. If I could give a 9,5 I would. It, it just.. the small details in designing! WHY AKIRA.","

Geez, feels like I just watched the rest of the movie in 30 seconds... Listen. Too much MINDLESS ANIME.. 80% of the characters are too cartoonish... Like it came out of a Cartoon Network universe... Please bring back the original DragonBall Z graphics and art style instead of thiss.. thisss bs Mickey Mouse dreadful animation... (Like Vegeta & Raditz as a kid)... The fighting transportation scenes are nice, a bit over kill in some scenes but it's okay just make it more understandable...The ''sexual'' space girl who's suppose to replace Bulma.. is a bit too much.. With her touching, showing off her body is coming off as being over seductive... Please don't make it as the other 99% of sexual mindless anime shows on funimation & crunchyroll... and Broly's father wearing that pink mini shirt??.... Once again... CALM DOWWNN....Overall this tv was funny.. Typical Goku and Vageta. The new babysitter?? Hilarious.. I would've gave it a 7 or 8 out of 10 but all the mindless animations truly brings it down.. It doesn't look like a Dragonball series tv show anymore... If they keep on doing it this way all the original fans will loose interest on this 4-5 year old kid cartoon tv show that it will eventually become... Ughh...","

"gallsinfrastructuremgr","17 January 2019","So I have been watching Dragon ball since I was a kid. Huge fan watched all series though multiple times. However, this movie had great action, story, etc... no complaints there. However my issue is that they didn't account or care about past cannon knowledge.1. We are aware Frieza requested Vegeta to be brought to him and Vegeta blamed Frieza for making him into the person he was... left out... also made kid vegeta seem bratty and annoying unlike the flashbacks in the series in which he respected his people and father and was proud to be the prince of all sayians.2. Bardock was given the ability to see the future he knew Frieza was going to destroy Vegeta and knew Goku would defeat him. Not mentioned or covered.3. Goku was sent to earth to wipe it clean for sale, even Raditz noted it would fetch a good price... and noted Goku was sent there with instructions to wipe itn and he lost his memory. However we have in this movie a superman type send off by his parents and not as a normal job as originally depicted in the series noting earth as not worth anything.4. Goku was born the same time as vegeta and broly had a decent power level here hes weak and a possible late bloomer. Granted he was low class but they seemed to make it worse.5. During the fight Vegeta is fighting at God level and having issues with Goku able to jump in at that point and handle Broly at normal state... that was a crock...6. Vegeta has the ability to go SSBE he never does this... its a level Goku as we know hasn't reached... and as we know before the movie he can't and hasn't went UI again. So Vegeta should have out classed Goku in terms of power.Perhaps I am a stickler for details but little things like that bother me... but as stated other than these oversights it was a good movie.","

Anyone who says that the animation was bad has no clue what good animation is or doesn't now what's the difference between animation and drawings.The only things I don't like about the movie was the retcon of Goku's past and Bardock (I know it's all canon with DB Minus but I'm still not a fan of that story) and the unnecessary CGI.","

"pmac429","18 January 2019","This movie did such a great job of making Broly a likeable, interesting character. So much better than Broly's original (non canon) origin. The animation, music, and fight sequences were spectacular. Also bringing Gogeta into canon was long overdue.The one small issue I had was Goku's redone origin. It was taken right from the pages of Dragon Ball Minus. It worked, it was in many ways more heartfelt than the original origin. The only problem is that it contradicts Raditz in the show. I'm fine with Bardock's TV special being erased. Because although yes it is amazing, this movies take on Bardock and Goku's relationship was also very good. But in the show, when Raditz comes to earth he explains to Goku that he was sent to Earth to destroy is because it was profitable. Which contradicts why Bardock would've sent him to Earth. And it contradicts that Bardock did it at all.I guess the way to pass up that idea is that Gine and Bardock lied to Raditz and told him he was sent to Earth to kill everyone and it was profitable. But it is still a slight annoyance.Overall without that small nitpick this movie was fantastic. It was fresh and original, while also providing a great amount of fan service.10/10 would recommend","

"IppeiK","20 January 2020","The revival of the Dragon Ball franchise with the ""Super"" series has been somewhat of a phenomenon, and it has continued with this movie (the first one I've seen which wasn't also a season of the TV series).I was initially confused as to why they were doing another Broly film, because he has appeared and been defeated at least 3 times before. This film, however, does an incredible job of building the backstory and thus adding a bit of emotion to the film. To this end, they use the characters and their personalities well to create something that is just more than powering up and battles (there is that, but it's not just that).Only obvious downside is the fact that non-Dragon Ball fans probably won't be able to enjoy this as much but, if you were going to watch one Dragon Ball movie. This would be the one to watch.","

"serrisex","2 January 2019","The film itself is absolutely awesome. It mixes emotional content and brutal fighting really well. All the movie can be split on two parts: introduction in Broly's and other saiyans story, then fighting-fighting-fighting. That's strange, the main reason for this, I believe, is origins of Bardock's family story in the film which was borrowed from a tiny manga, totally uncanonical.
And here's the problem of this fabulous movie: from DBZ we know quite well that saiyans are the warrior race and their occupation is killing. Goku's mother was quite tough woman and we saw it with our own eyes. But now DBS: Broly tells us many, many of saiyans and Gine herself were... absolutely human. And it's very, very bad. Movie is canon now, but it collides with previous canon.So, the positive and negative sides of movie:
+ Broly, the monster who kills for revenge from previous movies now has a much better story and character you'll love
+ fresh art style, top quality animation
+ fight scenes are something else, you need to see itToriyama knows how to make you feel, but he makes entirely different person from Gine in the processNo matter what, movie is must see for any Dragon Ball fan and all the good anime lovers, too.","

"balajtitibor","15 January 2022","An excellent sequel to DB Super. The visuals are the best we've seen so far (just like in the One Piece: Stampede movie), though it has to be said that the fights it was invented in the first place. It expanded the world nicely (for exemple :planet Vampa), and we also learned more about the Saiyan-Frieza relationship and history. It was a good move to get to know Goku's mother Gene, a rethink like Broly Tarzan. We can't have a bad word for music amd The tempo. The dubbing sounds seem to have really enjoyed their role, and the new supporting actors have also been brought in very well. I couldn't imagine Broly without Cheelai and Lemo in the sequel. And the last 40 minutes of the film put the crown on the movie. The fanservice was also stylish, not overdone. It was just time to see the divine figure of Vegita as well. The fights are beautiful, liquid-drawn (i.e., swirling) and the coeography is incredible. There may be so many mouth pulls because the Galic Gun was yellow, and Broly's Super Saiyan Full Power form (Legendary Super Saiyan) was insignificant. It doesn't hurt to let go of the levels of power for this film because it's interesting enough to think that with a simple mortal negligible practice, it can humiliate two people who have surpassed all the gods already. Another mistake is to note that the story is really quite slim, but I think in addition to the many good things the film serves is forgivable. In summary, it comes with a lot of surprises and everything there is to love about Dragon Ball. I can only recommend a mandatory piece.","

"JokerSmokers","27 January 2019","This movie preludes the events that occurred up till present day where Vegeta and Goku arent willing to be complacent in their strength would like to further themselves. This movie sees Freeza make a come back but as usual his power hungry ways blinds him from the bigger picture. His tunnel vision only unleashes a wrath that will be the demise of every living being and places risk on himself as well as planet earth. This movie focuses on the many phases and strengths the Saiyans themselves enjoy and how they develop their strategy in each failed attempt to stop Brolly. Many scenes action packed and vividly colourful. The movie comes to an end which may or may not surprise you.","

"wagamarcin","14 February 2021","First and foremost I'm a big Dragon Ball fan. It went through my childhood, teenage age and now it goes and make impact on my adulthood. I really love the idea of making a canonical movie that fits with original storyline and prolongs happenings of DB Super serie.Broly was created firstly in Dragon Ball movie 7: Legendary Super Saiyan. Comparing to contemporary Broly, the elder one had origin that was insulting our DB hearts and emotions. The dumbest reason of involving a villain i have ever met. A guy who was furious with Goku because Goku cried out loud and didn't allow to sleep Broly peacefully. Laziness in its all entirety.
Our more funky Broly perhaps hasn't great and mind-blowing roots and is simple in its simplicity but when you rewrite character you need to place some interesting stuff. Like e.g his friendship with furry monster. His madness is also quite good explain with father who leeches Broly to fulfill ambitions to rule whole galaxy.Another step are fighting scenes. Very good looking but some CGI interrupts when you're not familiar with it as a DB fan. Honestly I love final stage of power tournament in DB Super because it's great drawn, dynamic and without CGI what is kinda artificial for me. Maybe I'm too demanding and it was just a little scratch on a awesome surface.What about our main blokes? I'm proud that Vegeta is well presented here with all of his esteem and proud. I boast the way that he isn't guy who Brolly pummels and makes a train bag out of him. Vegeta plays similar part as Goku and it is hell of a satisfying. Frankly, Goku struggles more in this movie. And a solution to defeat Broly by making a fusion shows Broly huge potential but also his limits. Gogeta plays with him with confidence at the last part of a fight. Canonically Gogeta is shown for the first time. And they nailed it. Everyone waited for that moment and should be happy.Ok, maybe this review is a mess but I've watched that film 15 min ago and it left me with great emotions and I'm impressed. The best DB movie and there is nothing to argue about.
My rate 8 out of 10.","

The battle scenes are extremely impressive and I never found myself looking at the clock thinking is it nearly over?The script is entertaining, the music is cool and at a run time of 1h40 minutes I think it is the perfect length.Highly enjoyable from start to finish and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series.","

"ShYnBrCk","24 January 2019","This movie has everything you would want if you're a fan of any Dragon Ball shows, movies, mangas. And yet, it is a fantastic introduction, I believe, to the universe itself. I went along with a couple friends, one who had watched some DBZ but very loosely, and the other that had not seen one minute of the series. And once the credits rolled and we walked out, we were all stoked.The movie gives an exceptional background to the origins of Goku, Vegeta, Frieza, and the star of the movie, Broly. You didn't need to know anything about any of these guys before to understand the rest of the movie. As a long time DBZ fan, I learned new stuff. The only issue with a newcomer coming into this is that they wouldn't know the power-ups that Goku and Vegeta obtain (Super Saiyan God, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan/Blue), but I don't think you need to know that. It's clear that each new iteration is a more powerful one. As to the namesake of the movie, Broly's character was extremely cool and really flushed out. A man of little words that possesses incredible power. Maybe a cliché trope, but it fit so well.The fights were some of the best Dragon Ball fights out there. It was non-stop, fast, visually pleasing, and raw. There were no lulls. I sat there tense as to what was gonna happen next in the fights. The humor was great, the dubbing was fantastic, and the animation, during the fights and in-between, were second to none.Overall, this movie was a joy to watch. It was legitimately fun. And if you're a hardcore DBZ fan, you'll love it beyond belief.","

"alirethaalwash","2 February 2019","I really love Broly and Bardock ,but the whole idea of Broly is him being unbeatable just making him lose (even to Gogeta) will destroy his fundamentals, they also ruined Bardock's character by making him smart and good hearted he much was better with being a more typical saiyan","

"amittripleh","31 January 2019","The prologue section was so touchy. The character was phenomenal. The action scenes are way to cool; The transformations are as usual. And who can give up to the SAIYAN SCREAM. A good to go storyline to make a damn good start with the new arc.","

"gsullengermovies","22 January 2019","I have been a number one fan of Dragon Ball for almost 8 years so I know more than even other hardcore fans. This film is not only the best Dragon Ball film I've ever seen but also the best animation ive ever seen in the franchise. Goku is a character that whenever you need him to pull through he will and it shows throughout the entire franchise this film included. Surprisingly the only part that wasn't 1000% for me was Gogeta he was kind of underwhelming and I enjoyed the other fights a bit more. Broly is an actual character now which is great he actually has a really touching story about his childhood. I do not see this moving out of my top 5 movies of the year.","

"dmarvcel","29 January 2019","To clarify, I didn't watch much of Dragon Ball Super, stopping near episode 55. Even without watching the ""Tournament of Power"" arc, I could still catch onto almost everything featured in this movie. All you really need to watch in order to understand this recent Dragon Ball feature, are the movies: ""Battle of Gods"" and ""Resurrection F"".","

"ilirahmeti","30 January 2019","As a Dragonball fan i loved the Movie animation wise and Story wise.Especially the beginning was really entertaining with the animation and the story all was good put together but as the movie continued they over did it with the part where gogeta fights Broly with the breaking dimensions scenes which is a little too much.Now after watching the Movie you ask yourself questions like ""Is Broly stronger than Jiren?"" ""Is Gogeta stronger than Beerus?"" And being honest i dont think that Broly is stronger than Jiren. If Goku went 20x kaioken SSB i think Goku would be able to do something against him where else when he fought jiren in that form it didnt do anything. Gogeta is on par with Jiren i think but still a little below Beerus. But MUI Goku is stronger than all of them.","

"mike-dion","24 January 2019","Just went to the movies and saw this movie. And man was i disapointed. I have never seem such a bad anime movie not only was the story itself crappy. But the anime style fight scenes soundtracks and power levels were completely ruined. I would say save uraelf the time and money and dont watch this really bad title",NA

"Leo24407","2 November 2022","This movie was better than the entire dragon ball super anime. If all the arcs of the anime were like this movie, it would've been of the best anime of all time. The animation was amazing to look at, the fight between Gogeta and Broly was brutal; I mean all of the fights were, we could see Broly's potential of being one of the strongest saiyajins ever. Broly's backstory was really good aswell, seeing that he was like a caveman, with no knowledge of the ""real world"" was cool to see.And of course, seeing Vegeta in SSJG for the first time was absolutely perfect.Overall I think this was a masterpiece and one of the best anime movies ever.",NA
