"benjaminskylerhill","5 April 2023","Granted, this film is not going to appeal to people who have never been fans of any games featuring the titular brothers. But given the fact that these filmmakers were tasked with making a movie that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations, they did a pretty good job. In fact, a slightly better job than I was expecting.The voice cast was the subject of much controversy, and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot-on. A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion, but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters.Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences, and some of them were quite thrilling. This is easily Illumination's most visually stunning film, and a massive step up from every one of their other films since the first Despicable Me.As for the plot, it's just the plot of every Mario game. And for the most part, that's all it needs to be. Every beat plays out almost exactly like you'd expect it to, with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there.The messiest parts of the movie, if I'm going to get critical, are the dialogue (which is often quite stupid) and the characters. They just try to deal with too many of them, and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires, almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff, and even when there is a payoff, it's haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending.Although I think 85-90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated film normally, this one could've benefitted from an extra 10-20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more. We move so quickly from location to location that there's never any time to breathe or get invested.But that's my adult perspective. I had a pretty breezy, fun, and heartwarming time, though I would've liked more meat on the script.My theater was PACKED, and probably 75% young children, and they all seemed to have the time of their lives. Your kids will probably love it, and you will probably more than tolerate it.","

"Ltufano23","5 September 2023","Video games have long been plagued by subpar adaptions of their materials, but on their second attempt, the Mario Bros save the day. Being on par with the likes of Sonic and Detective Pikachu, this film hits all the fun beats you would want from a Mario film. Including plenty of fun moments for fans of the expansive franchise, this also stays completely understandable and entertaining for anyone who checks it out. With some interesting voice acting choices, no one took you out of the film and everyone felt like great choices for this vibrant world. Wishing that it stood out more or took on more intriguing choices, I was still walking away happy and hopeful for the future of this franchise and the possibilities to come.","

"SnoopyStyle","19 April 2023","Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling Brooklyn brother plumbers. When the city's sewer goes haywire, Mario sees an opportunity for heroic fame. Instead, they get sucked into an alternate world. The brothers get separated. Mario joins Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser (Jack Black). Luigi gets captured.It's brightly colored. It's energetic. It's got the characters. There's the game play. The story is fairly simple. It's pretty much what I expected. I wish there is more heart to it. The brothers could have been that, but they get separated pretty quickly. I played some of the games over the years and this will probably appeal to the fans. It's got all the brightly colored chaos for the kids. It's less so for everybody else.","

"AdrenalinDragon","5 April 2023","I think for what this movie sets out to do, Super Mario Bros. Movie pretty much ticks the boxes of an entertaining, reference fan-service heavy movie. A lot of the jokes are basic sure, but it's just impressive that there is some competency to a Video Game Movie. Sometimes simple and straightforward is the best way to go. Not high art or anything, but it ticks off almost everything for what Mario should be at least. Voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought, and Jack Black was the highlight as expected. Yeah, not gonna win any big awards but judge it for what it is, and yeah by Video Game Movie standards it's one of the best ones easily if you ask me.6.5/10.","

"nickryan-44535","5 April 2023","I am someone who is not swayed by ""critics"" or rotten tomato scores. I didn't even really have any expectations going into this movie. As someone who grew up playing Super Mario Bros, Super Mario World etc., I was really just going to see this movie based on nostalgia and it does deliver on nostalgia. The visuals are stunning, and while everyone has their reservations about Chris Pratt the voice acting is perfect (except one for one elderly character). While many have said this movie moves quickly or ""too fast"", I would say it has great pacing and never leaves you bored. While it is not a perfect film it leaves little to be desired. It is everything you want from an animated Super Mario Movie.","

"justinvitelli","5 April 2023","First off this movie is for kids and fans of Nintendo and the Mario franchise. I still think an adult who isnt a fan could still enjoy it but this movie is so full of fan service that it will have you smiling the whole time. The voice acting I was skeptical but they all work and work well too. Jack Black is the star here. I love how they kept the story simple like all of the games. Truly felt like a video game on screen. This movie felt like a beautifully animated amusement park ride. The audio in the movie was amazing too. The sounds and the score with reimagined iconic music was perfect. Some of the songs in the movie felt unnecessary but they worked. I think they should've bumped the run time to 105-120 min. 90 min felt too short as it goes by quick. I havent had this much wholesome fun at the movies in a long time. If youre a fan you HAVE to see it.","

"folk_egm","5 April 2023","This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don't necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan's wishes, but it's understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much. But if you don't think too much, it's an easy and enjoyable movie to watch, with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me.","

"gabethedinosaur","6 April 2023","After meeting Chris Pratt at the Santa Barbara film festival I'm very amazed of how remarkable Chris played Mario for the first. I remember playing Mario kart double dash on GameCube 20 years ago with my sister during Christmas Day and I absolutely loved the game . Universal and Nintendo did a great job making this movie for kids and adults who played the video game since the 80s 90s 2000s to now . The Mario movie was absolutely awesome and very creative from the video game . Chris was absolutely hilarious as Mario . Jack black as bowser was the best for the film. His voice was a mixture of Vader which I find so outstanding. Chris who voiced Mario did a fantastic job. He used the characters voice very carefully. The sounds were just like the video game. And i think that was absolutely awesome. The story taking place in New York to the mushroom kingdom is brilliant. Princess peach was the best part of the movie . She had a good way of showing bowser she will not marry a turtle . And toad was the best part of the movie . The rest of the characters including donkey Kong voiced by Seth rogen was so awesome. I hope in the next Mario movie yoshi finds Mario and Luigi and becomes they're pet.","

"mj-80986","5 April 2023","Took my kids for a special sky screening and boy were we excited! At first I was rather skeptical thinking this film won't do any justice to the games. However, I was wrong! This film met our expectation and beyond. I think I enjoyed this film more than my kids. From the moment the film starts it is enjoyable. Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes. A lot of laughable moments. Apart from the film being too short it still met my expectations. As a 39 year old who played all the Mario games since childhood, this bought back a lot of fond memories of sleepless nights of playing the Mario games. A must watch film whether you have kids or not.","

"movies_are_life_","10 April 2023","Sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. It's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out. If not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.","

"christiam-51976","6 April 2023","Some people are taking this movie too seriously. This movie is just supposed to be fun and colorful and not to be taken like a tarantino movie or something. Of course the plot could be improved a bit here and there but it's actually a really fun and entertaining movie when you just enjoy the ride. If you're a big fan of Mario you will absolutely love this movie 100%. I felt like a little kid again when i saw all the characters and easter eggs in every scene. The animation was insanely well done and i believe they could've made the movie a bit longer to expand on the world a bit more and get to know each character more but that's about it.","

"educunhaholanda","8 April 2023","If you only watch the movie with the intention of having fun, you will certainly have a good experience with Mario. However the plot is quite bland and the movie runs at a very fast pace between one scene and another, hampering the progress of the story.Also, if you haven't played the Mario games, you'll fail immeasurably to pick up the game references that are scattered throughout the movie, and there are many of them. For anyone who's a Mario fan, this movie is literally fan service and it's no wonder why they're giving it a 10.For me, this movie doesn't lived up to the hype, but for a Mario fan, it certainly did.","

"Arts-student","21 April 2023","As a purely fluff piece - it's fun, bright spirited, and enjoyable for families. A movie that has all of the elements you'd want represented from Super Mario bros video games, and as a bonus, it also showcases Mario cart and donkey kong junior. The animation is strong, the worlds are exactly like the video games and truly fun moments for kids. The runtime is great and the movie moves along without pause.AND I expect better, higher quality movie making.The voice acting in this movie is so lazy. Chris Pratt is forgettable-anyone could have done better voicing such a beloved character. Princess Peach is the same - voice acting is boring and fairly emotionless. The worst voice acting belongs to Seth's terrible Donkey Kong junior - not a single attempt to make an actual character voice, just Seth's normal voice slapped on Donkey Kong. Toad's voice acting is also meatless and without any real jokes.The script is mostly empty and there is little to no attempt at character motivation, organic character decision making - for example, why Princess Peach tells Mario he can come with her to save her kingdom. Almost every opportunity to make a joke is skipped. None of the characters have stated goals aside from King Koppa.And saddest of all to me, there is no attempt to create backstory or give context to these beloved worlds and characters.","

"ColinTheGorilla","9 April 2023","This movie is so much damn fun and I absolutely loved everything about it. The composing in this movie is some of the best I've ever heard and it fit so well in the movie. The voice acting was pretty good too and I didn't think Chris Pratt would be any good as Mario but he was actually pretty good but Jack Black stole the show as Bowser as he absolutely killed his role. Charlie Day was great too as Luigi as he was probably my 2nd favorite in the movie. The only problem I have with this movie is it felt so quick and I wish it was longer and it's only 90 minutes. Other than that this movie is just a ton of fun and worth the watch.","

"javier_8","14 April 2023","First of all: This is A MOVIE FOR KIDS, it's not for grown ups, don't be a 30-something or 40-something years old and expect to see the best movie of your lifetime. It's not gonna happen, it's a kids movie.When I was a kid I saw the old Hopkins-Leguizamo movie... OMG, it was horrible. I get it, we didn't have CGI back then, but an animated movie like this one would have been amazing. Waaaay better than that... garbage of a film.This new one explores all the common elements of the franchise, beautifully crafted world with attention to details. My 7 year old girl LOVED IT. I was kinda bored, but she loved it, this rating is for her, that's what's important, it's a movie for kids, they should rate it.There are a lot of man-childs on the internet criticizing it. Don't listen to them. If you have a kid who loves Mario just take them, no doubt about it. If you're a nostalgic grown up, you're not going to have a bad time, but it's not what you expect, there are like 1 or 2 ""grown up jokes"", that's it, it's not like those disney movies that have a lot of hints for grown ups, this one doesn't, it's a KIDS MOVIE as it should be.I get that grown ups need to be entertained, but it shouldn't be the rule, the most important thing is that kids love it.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","5 April 2023","**Possible Spoilers**30 years since 1993's fever dream live-action nightmare, The Super Mario Bros. Movie rights the wrongs of the last one; though it's certainly not a perfect movie, it's perfectly fine for what it is, and as family entertainment goes I've seen far worse than it. And with the gorgeous animation, the faithfulness to the games and the music, Chris Pratt and co. Do their best with the same old 'Mario comes to save Peach' storyline being worn thin at this point.Sure the film's problems can be dissected to the nth degree on YouTube retrospectives talking about the movie, but it is what it is and it works where other blockbuster fan-service vehicles have failed (like Terminator: Dark Fate, Ghostbusters 2016 or The Lion King 2019). And Mario (at least Nintendo) has the potential to become a cinematic powerhouse that defies the 'bad' press and reviews (they're more mixed for the movie).The film is basically feature-length comfort food more than anything else; and considering it's a family film that's pretty harmless, I'd say it's done its job more than well. Certainly better than Illumination's other more recent films I'd say.The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the safest kind of cinema, and maybe some people should accept what they see; but not everyone has to. Besides, fun is fun. 3.5/5 stars.P. S. Could this film lead to other stuff like Zelda hitting the big screen? Or maybe even Metroid? Who knows?","

"cruise01","9 April 2023","5 out of 5 stars.The Super Mario Bros movie is an awesome animated adventure film that is one of the best adaptation of a video game series. It has everything you can ask for. Its like an open world of nintendo game series like Donkey Kong making an appearance.The film is fast paced. The plot is good. It has a story about the bros. The film features a lot of easter eggs that can hint for more movies. The action sequences are awesome. Bowser is an awesome villain. The animation is beautifully done and stunning. The voice talent is also great.One of the best sequences involving a mario kart chase on a rainbow road is insane. Fans and kids will love the series and love how everything is put together in this film. Overall, i love everything about the film. I can not wait for more.","

"cplushie","8 April 2023","As a Mario fan myself it was a very enjoyable and fun action packed movie. While watching I just couldn't wipe the smile off my face. Jack black did an amazing job with voice acting bowser. Everyone did a great job and while I do agree Chris Pratt could have been better i got use to it really quick and im sure pretty much everyone else will too and besides, the Italian accent in the games is great but definitely not meant for a 80 minute movie. The plot is very simple which is good however because a Mario story shouldn't be complex at all and the people at illumination definitely know how the games should be. Speaking of that, you can tell the people behind this movie put a lot of heart into it. Definitely give this a strong recommendation if you like Mario or have childhood memories with Mario in any way or just wanna watch an enjoyable family movie.","

"knives123","6 April 2023","I love Mario, and I enjoyed this movie, and so did my 7y/o. But with that out of the way I'll be honest - this movie is quite bad, as movies go. The story is barely present, every scene leads into the next with very little plot or agency - things just happen, characters just need things, that place is suddenly a karting city, that other place has an elevator leading up to a castle straight up a cliffface. The script is probably just screams and the a few catchphrases. It's all held together by nostalgia baiting, references and pandering, wrapped in Minions slapstick. It is all barely coherent. There is also a thing to be said about the music which was murdering classic tunes, some of which is just shockingly bad.Is it a Mario movie? Sure. Is it a fun Mario product for the whole family? Yup. Is it a good movie? No, not really, in fact I'd give it a 6 if I am honest; not awful, but that's about it. So if you are 8 or a Mario fan - sure, you are likely to have a blast. But if you're just a person looking for a fun animation movie wholy uninvested in Mario? Nah, you can probably pass on this.","

"dfreyberg_rocks","5 April 2023","I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.","

"webslinger-00280","5 April 2023","The story was simple, but worked wonders with the excellent characters that perfectly reflected their game counterparts. They even had unique aspects given to them that helped them stand out in all the right ways. The action was phenomenal with great depth and detail that shows how much work was put into this. There were so many nods and references to other classic Nintendo properties that you'd want to go back to find them all. And Charles Martinet is in this with a small but great role. But with all that said, it does mess up its flow with some of the music. Definitely not the original score though, since it mixes the classic music with an epic and emotional tone. But the copyrighted music Illumination probably payed a third of their budget for felt out of place in this film and took me out of the experience a couple times. Other than that, it's an amazing that I'll gladly watch again.","

"ashfordofficial","16 May 2023","The animation was superb and eye-popping. Illumination really stepping up their game. Unfortunately the movie was a bland, witless and flagrantly pandering production with a weak and dull direction and screenplay. I didn't liked most of the mediocre VA performances and in my opinion Chris Pratt as Mario was an unfortunate miscast. The standout and probably the best performance was Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach.The movie was a monotonous mess from the beginning to the end. Shoehorned pop songs were a distraction and also an embarrassment (You guys ain't James Gunn). The ending had too much cringe and it was an unsatisfying conclusion to a tasteless fan service.","

"namob-43673","18 April 2023","The headline basically tells the story. This is not a good movie. Anyone who claim this is a great fantastic movie probably have some issues. But this is neither as horrible as I see some people argue. This is just a middle-of-the-road sometimes funny decently entertaining movie with bad music and very lazy writing.The good is that this is decently fun, even funny a few times. And if you are a fan of the games, especially Mario Cart, you will smile through many scenes. The voice acting is great, and if you are a simple kid you are likely going to love this. Sadly there ends the good stuff.The bad starts with the story, or rather lack thereof. Because it is as simplistic as the games which is both a strength and a weakness, but mostly a weakness because this movie offers nothing. It is actually kinda soulless and cliche. The music is mostly atrocious. Just put on Mario Cart music on bad speakers and you basically have this movie. But what really bothers me though is that the lack of story and very simplistic writing which feels so lazy. No one really cared. They only wanted to make a fast paced Super Mario Movie with as many callbacks and in-house jokes as possible, and that is it. There is no deeper meaning, nothing new, no real character development, nothing worth noting. Also most of the fun stuff you already saw in the trailer, it is not much else. So lazily done.Sure you might have fun watching this, because it is not a bad movie, but will you remember this a few weeks from now? Will this be a classic? Do you want to see more? The answers to those questions is a big ""No"".In the end I give this a 5/10. If you have kids you think you might like this or you are high and want to get away from reality for a while, perhaps go see this. For the rest of you this will be a Meh at best.","

"keystone_koasters","5 April 2023","As a Super Mario fan myself, I was hyping this movie up for quite a while. So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the ""you just got Luigi'd"" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.","

"SimonsRants","7 April 2023","Completely unmemorable. I didn't hate anything in the movie and even kind of enjoyed some of the funnier moments (Jack Black as Boswer steals every scene he's in) but it was so unoriginal and so formulaic it felt like a cliff notes of a plot rather than an actual plot. I'm still in the parking lot of the theater and I'm struggling to remember anything about the movie. Just the epitome of mediocre.I think it's also about time we stop hiring famous actors to play animated characters just because they're famous actors. Some of the actors do great in this, but there was absolutely nothing about Pratt's performance that justified him being cast.","

"parksiet","6 April 2023","As I started to write this review, I was told I was being too harsh on this movie. I was told to think of it more as a video game playing out on screen, to just have fun with it. And frankly, I have a different perspective, as I will get into. But it just reminds me of the beauty of film; the subjectivity of all our opinions. We can all go into the same movie, and all come out with a variety of different opinions, thoughts, and interpretations. Mine isn't the right one, it is just my opinion. But let me just say, it's a fact that audiences are going to enjoy the heck out of The Super Mario Bros. Movie! My proof? The audience I saw it with went nuts for it, there was lots of cheering and clapping, and a round of applause at the end (reactions I haven't seen since Spider-Man: No Way Home). But while everyone else was clapping at the end, I was sitting there thinking to myself: ""That's it?""Before you try and guess where this is going, NO I did not hate this movie. I enjoyed myself the whole time and loved so many moments in it. I have played Mario games all my life, especially lots of Mario Kart, so seeing these iconic characters and locations on screen was a blast. There were so many references that made me smile, and I even loved how cues from the music in the games were used in the score here. The whole movie has many great moments, from the Mario Kart scene to the Donkey Kong vs Mario fight, to the training scene in the Mushroom Kingdom that plays out exactly like me trying to play the games (a real struggle). But your liking or disliking of this movie really comes down to how far these Mario-isms go for you. The plot is simple, hollow even. The Illumination style doesn't help. But the Nintendo stuff is exactly what you want. So if you are a fan of Mario, you'll have a good time! If not, this movie probably isn't for you, you'll probably come out of it confused about why so many people are loving it. Me? I think I've established myself as very mixed.And yeah, some of you are going to say I'm being too harsh on this movie. Trust me, I don't want to be, nor do I think I am. I did love the Mario stuff, I just really would've liked an actual script next time... it plays more like a demo of the world of Mario. The movie is still really cute and perfect for kids, it does a great job of capturing the spirit of the games and the excitement of the set pieces, it is just a pretty hollow script that barely operates as a narrative feature. Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad are all very blank slate characters (although this is perhaps at the request of Nintendo, maybe they didn't want overly specific versions of these marquee characters). Really, I think most of my issues stem from the Illumination side of things. This movie has all the same qualities as any other Illumination film, from Minions to The Secret Life of Pets: it's got 20 gags (or references) per minute and really moves fast through story and character moments - it feels like a movie speed run. I would've liked it to slow down more, explore more of the world and get more time with the characters. It also had some humor that didn't work for me, but seemed to work for people around me (singing Bowser wasn't my favorite). But frankly, I really can't fault the movie for all this, it did what every other Illumination film does. So it's easier for me just to accept that maybe Illumination's style isn't for me. I prefer the Pixar or DreamWorks style, or if we're talking about this type of movie, I prefer The LEGO Movie or the two Sonic films as those were both very good stories with thematic elements while honoring their source material (and being very charming films too!)The voice cast was actually decent! I don't always love Illumination's insistence on hiring big-name actors over voice actors, but it worked here for the most part. Jack Black was awesome as Bowser, same goes for Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, and the rest of the cast was pretty good too! But here's the big question: how was Chris Pratt's Mario voice? And the answer - it was fine. He did well for what they had him do, although I didn't love that this Mario had a Brooklyn accent over the classic Italian one. I thought it worked for the most part, but I still would have preferred they just use the original Mario voice.I can be critical all I want. I could mention how the needle drops were too much, I could go on about the lack of plot, I could complain about how I wished it was longer, but I don't want to. Because as a Mario fan, I loved so many moments here. I was smiling throughout the film. Sure, some things didn't always work, but I had a good time, as did everyone else in my showing. Kids will go nuts for it, it's a great family film. It's so joyful and energetic and feels like a fun adaptation of the Mario games. Plus the animation is fantastic! It's pretty cute, and will be very re-watchable. The movie is by no means perfect, but families looking for a good movie will find one with The Super Mario Bros. Movie! And of course, this will be perfect for any Mario fan!Now, time to go play some Mario Kart!","

"BA_Harrison","5 April 2023","There's an awful lot of fan service in The Super Mario Bros. Movie: long-time Nintendo players will certainly have their hands full trying to spot all of the easter eggs. I'm thinking that the writers of the film thought this enough, because they certainly didn't bother coming up with a decent plot. I can see a lot of adults finding the predictable storyline and weak humour tiresome; easily pleased youngsters will no doubt enjoy the rapid pace, crazy characters and colourful graphics, but I imagine a large percentage of those hidden references to games gone by won't mean much to anyone under the age of ten.It's a shame because the film looks great, the different Super Mario worlds brought to dazzling life in a welter of colourful CGI animation that is undeniably impressive. I only wish that as much care and attention had gone into crafting a script worthy of the creative visuals.5.5/10, rounded down to 5 for the 'happy' ending in which Mario's actions result in the destruction of most of Brooklyn, presumably with a death toll running into the tens of thousands. Wahoo -- that's a not so great!","

"erick-hernandez","5 April 2023","There are some very minor spoilers ahead, i just want to say that this movie exceeded my expectations! The Critic score should not be taken seriously it's nowhere near a bad nor average movie. There are some things that i didn't like about it but overall i left the theaters with a smile.The Visuals are probably the best Illumination Studios has ever done, very smooth and gorgeous to look at. The human characters like Mario, Luigi and Peach's faces look different from their videogame counterparts and kind of weird at first but you will get used to them and at least their clothing match but on the other hand the animals and creatures from the Mushroom Kingdom like the Koopas, Donkey Kong and Bowser all look very accurate and detailed.The Voice Acting, Sorry but Mario does NOT sound like Mario, at all in this movie! I'm not a fan of Chriss Pratt's acting as Mario. Luigi sounds better but not accurate either, Peach is good i guess and Donkey Kong sounds like Seth Rogen...Yay... Bowser however, gets a straight 10/10 Jack Black actually tried to sound like Bowser and he should be cast again as Bowser in future movies. Long time Mario fans will be surprised to know that Charles Martinet is also in the movie, but not as Mario... The character he got to act for is such a waste and not even worth mentioning to be honest.The Story is not your typical Mario videogame story, it's actually baffling at first how literal they took the Mario ""origin"" story of him being a New York plumber. The movie starts going in the wrong direction but as the movie goes on it becomes better and better and ultimately it worked in the end. The pacing is very fast there is no real character development except for Luigi and maybe Mario but there's just too many relevant characters and not enough time to flesh them out. At least they all have defined personalities.Overall, it's not an Amazing movie but definitely a fun and good first outing by Nintendo and Illumination, it's full of Mario references and just good fan service like a Mario movie should be. Here's hoping future Mario movies!!And 8 but giving it a 10 to even out the hater trolls.","

"nightwishouge","7 April 2023","There was an uproar when Chris Pratt was announced as the voice of Mario. Personally, I don't hate Pratt (although I don't love him, by any means) but it was a disconcerting sign that The Super Mario Brothers Movie might be taking the typical Illumination Studios route of throwing a big-name cast on top of an uninspired script. Now that I've seen the movie, were those fears justified? Yes. Yes they were.I'm not, by most definitions, a ""fan"". Especially by current definitions, which require you to Stan anything you even remotely like to the point of issuing death threats against anyone who dares to speak ill of it. If I like things, I like them for personal reasons, not to tie my identity to them or to take part in some screaming mob. I don't tend to get hyped for, and subsequently disappointed by, the latest big-budget movie. Worst case scenario: I'll forget about it a year from now.But I was cautiously optimistic for the Super Mario Brothers Movie. I'm not a gamer, but like many of my generation I have a lifelong association with Mario. My first video game console was an NES. In high school I played Mario Party and Super Mario Kart for hours on end with my friends. Recently I completed Super Mario 3D World on Switch--probably the first video game I've played all the way through in at least a decade. I guess you could say the franchise is important to me.Beyond the actual games themselves, I like the universe Nintendo has created for Mario. It's colorful and comforting and fun. I like the gentle characters, the imaginative game mechanics, the simple storylines and low-key conflicts. If I ever got an urge to write fan fiction, I'd probably set it in the Marioverse. It might not be great, but it would be sincere and nostalgic and full of the joy that the games have given me. Super Mario Bros., by contrast, feels like it was made by a team that never played a single Nintendo video game, much less understands what is appealing about them.Everything about this is boring. The story is rote and chock full of confusing decisions. The characterizations are flat and dull. The action sequences move so fast, with so little impact, that none of them really matter. The animation is...well, fine I guess, but I'm not giving anybody credit for simply NOT ruining the visually-pleasant environment that game designers have been building upon for forty years.The screenplay--as per usual in such cases--is the culprit. It's the standard kids-movie template with nothing in the way of heart or wonder. Just a bunch of famous people talking fast and pretending that's an inherently funny thing. Every animation studio apart from Pixar is terrified of sincerity these days, so SMB takes the typical approach of being its own episode of Cinemasins by having the characters constantly lampshade every bizarre aspect of the Marioverse that the games have simply taken for granted over the years: ""Okay, so these bricks float in the air, that's normal."" ""Whoa, a talking mushroom, I guess that's not weird or anything."" I think studio executives have this idea that they need to pander to the adults in the audience with these constant self-referential quips or else we'll spend the entire movie laughing at how little sense it makes, but guess what, Hollywood: not every adult is a detached YouTuber who cynically combs through genre movies to crow about ""plot holes"". Some of us just want to invest in a fantastical world without reservation. Some of us want to go on an earnest adventure without a jaded peanut gallery continually cracking wise and undercutting everything that makes a magical realm special. Can you imagine how insufferable Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy would be if every other line was Aragorn being like, ""Okay, an evil wizard made a ring that turns people invisible. Random!"" Then he leads a a ghost army and Galadriel shows up for no reason other than to deliver an aside like, ""Well, THAT happened."" Raise one eyebrow to show how unflappable and nonchalant she is. Then she does kung-fu or something because STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER (who will be completely marginalized in the third act so the men can save the day).So yeah, all the usual criticisms. A talented cast with nothing interesting to do. A shallow story that has no meaning and serves no purpose except to link together a bunch of pre-existing things you already know you like. A sense of humor that plays into the modern ""alternative"" comedy tradition of standing outside of things and ironically observing them rather than participating and having genuine feelings about things. A stupid and obvious soundtrack with thirty-plus-year-old pop songs. (That's especially egregious when Mario games have amassed possibly the most iconic musical library of all time. Does the tired training montage really benefit from the made-famous-again-by-Shrek-2 Bonnie Tyler hit ""I Need a Hero"" when it could be using, I don't know, ANY Koji Kondo track?) A movie that chooses to keep apologizing for its own existence rather than having any fun whatsoever.That live-action adaptation just keeps looking better and better.","

"Mauseum","18 April 2023","Graphics were fine, nothing spectacular. Bowser was only interesting when he was being menacing and any other time he was just stupid. Mario and Luigi had no connection. Peach was meant to be a strong and empowering female, but lack any depth. Toad was really bad. King was ok but Seth's stupid laugh was exhausting. Basically, besides the Nintendo references, there's not much to this movie. It just moves from one action scene to another with some stupid offset comedy between scenes. I was expecting something similar to Wreck it Ralph in style, heart and storyline. But by the end of it, it just feels empty and my kids didn't like it either.","

"evanston_dad","31 July 2023","I spent hours of my life playing Mario Bros. On the Nintendo way back in the day. I came into this movie expecting to wallow in the nostalgia of it.However, after an admittedly hilarious opening scene, I realized quickly that this movie was going to be a cynical cash grab banking on people exactly like me not caring whether the movie was good or not as long as we got our Mario fix. Well no, not good enough. Would it have been too much to ask that the film be both a loving homage to a popular game an an actually good movie at the same time? Apparently so, because this movie devolves into crappy chaos by the time it's over.Grade: C-","

"dsohn7","22 April 2023","I'm a Nintendo fan for life. From my SNES in the 90s to my current switch, Mario, Pokemon, and Zelda have been staples. But I'm not reviewing a video game. This is a movie, and I'm a screenwriter. Here are my thoughts:The entire story was loosely stitched together around how to force the Mario (and Luigi) into scenarios that reference familiar gameplay, from the classic obstacle courses, to rainbow road, DK country, Luigi's mansion, etc. Until they get to the boss battle.As a game: great. You have the controller in your hands. And every time you score coins, collect inventory, beat levels, etc. You get a little dopamine hit.Movies aren't about that. I'm not necessarily saying the Mario IP can't work as a movie, but the writer didn't focus much on adapting it into a movie. Fan service is necessary when adapting something that comes with a fanbase, but it should not be prioritized over the story. This movie was 90% fan service and as a result, Mario and Luigi turned into plot-driven characters who were as passive as two sticks in a river (of sewage).Their ineptitude as plumbers could have set their journey like a buddy cop movie where they have to prove themselves, save the day, and change the hearts of their disgruntled city, but those early scenes of them fumbling only served visual gags with zero consequences and until they moved on to something else.Oh, and all the boss battle required was the invincible star. As gamers, we know how that works but in telling a story, it's a total cop out that kills the tension and makes defeating Bowser too easy. They literally could've sat in place and waited for Bowser to arrive and did the same thing, rendering the entire middle section pointless.Illumination isn't great when it comes to story. I'm convinced they're more about what cute/silly characters they can sell merch for. Regardless of if you voted this 1 star or 7.4 (where it's at now as I write this), I think we can all agree, it's not a 10.","

"jackson_ro","5 April 2023","Can't help but feel like a massively missed opportunity for such a massive IP. While a lot of elements are added in from various games over the years, the script is simply flat and uninspiring, while fails to really showcase the wondrous world of the Super Mario Universe. However, I do understand that the film is a serious undertaking, attempting to introduce a somewhat dated character to a new generation of viewers who may or may not know much about them, but I think a better balance could have been done to appease both type of fans. The music score is definitely a highlight of the overall film, and I think that says a lot about the overall quality.","

"zkonedog","7 April 2023","In 1993, the live-action Super Mario Bros movie was such a travesty that it took three decades for Nintendo to dip its toes back into those waters. As such, 2023's ""Super Mario Bros Movie"" was highly anticipated but also wildly speculative in terms of what the final product might look like. The result: an absolutely smashing success from Illumination-a clinic in how to adapt a video game property for both the intended child audience and the nostalgic/legacy crowd!For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of the titular Italian brother duo. At film's open, Mario (Chris Pratt) & Luigi (Charlie Day) are down-on-their-luck plumbers just trying to stay in business. But when an opportunity arises to save Brooklyn, they are mysteriously whisked away into the Mushroom Kingdom, where the evil Bowser (Jack Black) threatens the realm of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Toadlings (notably Peach's closest assistant voiced by Keegan-Michael Key). Teaming up with Mario in this wild-and-wooly landscape, Peach must form an alliance with the Kongs-especially the warrior Donkey (Seth Rogan)-to stop the Koopa invasion.Adapting a property in which the user controls the experience-like video games-is always tricky for the big screen. Why would an individual want to watch a story about Mario & Co. When he/she could play it, right? Well, writer Matthew Fogel and directors Aaron Horvath & Michael Jelenic largely skirt this issue by leaning heavily on two mainstays:First, ""The Super Mario Bros Movie"" is made squarely for children. It is at that stage of life in which the Mario crew is often discovered, so this is 100% the right choice. In that sense, it plays like a Disney or Pixar flick with simply a more action/adventure bend to it. Does it mean that Bowser is often played for laughs? Yep. Do things get a little goofy at times? Certainly. But that is exactly how it should be in a Mario movie, as largely that is what the entire enterprise is based on-childhood fun! If you have young children who may not yet be familiar with-or just growing accustomed to-the Mario universe characters, this flick will almost certainly delight them!Just as importantly, ""The Super Mario Bros Movie"" does not short change the decades-long fans (like myself) who grew up with all this in the 1980s & 90s. Every scene or music cue here is imbued with at least some sort of significance to the broader Mario universe. Background ""Easter Egg"" references abound to the point that eagle-eyed viewers may find themselves distracted by the main plot in looking for them! Because so many warm-and-fuzzy, nostalgic memories are tied up in retro video game properties, seeing a ""Punch-Out Café"" or the iconic Duck Hunt mallard puts the viewer in a wonderful headspace to enjoy this experience.Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect as I settled into my theater seat. But as the credits rolled an hour and a half (perfect runtime for this fare!) later, I couldn't recall smiling for that long continuously at another movie in a long, long time. The children around me were enchanted by all of it and knowing laughs/gasps were exhaled at all the ""insider references"". I rarely have the desire to re-watch a theatrical release immediately upon finishing viewing #1, but this is the exception in which I could see it all again tomorrow and still have the same smile throughout!So, if you grew up playing Mario games-see this now! If you want to introduce your children to the Mario characters-take them to this now! Also, make sure to stay to the very end of the credits, in which some potential sequel-bait is teased tremendously. All in all, ""The Super Mario Bros Movie"" is a theatrical experience I will not soon forget.","

"mieriks","10 April 2023","This movie, about The Super Mario Bros on their journey through the Mushroom Kingdom, is the perfect Mario movie I never thought I could experience!I almost can't describe how enjoyable this was. So many characters and elements joined this incredible journey, and my attention was caught the entire time. I really loved the style and the way this movie was executed. Much was going on, but many things also gave enough time to let us enjoy, be happy and/or laugh about it. And speaking of laughing, I did it many times. The humor was just right! The Lumalee was unexpected hilarious, though!The story was kind of simple, predictable and straight forward, but that's how the Mario games are, aren't they? An interesting thing is that most of this movie was actually kind of about what we usually don't see from the characters in-between the main scenes from the games. We usually only see or hear the same moments or lines from each game, but this movie brought even more detailed personalities and backstories to the characters that really made some depth to the story. The best of all is that this part was done in a fantastic way. It didn't ruin anything! There were also a lot of fan services, but who doesn't love that when you're a big Mario fan? Super Mario Bros. (1985), Donkey Kong (1981) and Mario Kart 8 (2014) were just some parts of the huge amount of Easter Eggs. My favorite part was probably the Mario Kart sequence! There was so much to take in!Even though neither of the well-known characters were voiced by the original actors, the new actors did an incredible job by continuing to make these characters present their original personalities, and bring on the love for the audience. A great casting!The animation and its details and lighting were just insanely impressive! The most recent Mario games have great graphics, but it was both strange and amazing to see these characters in this amazing-looking world by Illumination Entertainment. Everything looked so original and good, and it was just like being inside games in a realistic way. It felt so alive! I also appreciated that there were surprisingly many, epic scenes that really gave some cool and awesome moments in a cinematic way!My props also go to composer Brian Tyler who created, reused and mixed many familiar melodies from many of the games that brought so much nostalgia and good feelings to the experience. There is no Mario without Mario soundtracks!This is my inner child's dream come true, and I'm forever happy that this movie came to life in a perfect way. So much could have gone wrong, but directors Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath made this successful in every way, and therefore, this is my favorite animation movie of all time!","

"petrow-31308","9 April 2023","Pros: it looks nice and sounds OK. The creative department showed obvious care in the making.Cons: the ""story"" is an absolute garbage, the aim was to cram as many 'memberries from the games into the 92 min runtime as possible, with a connecting tissue that is as complicated as a wedge. The pacing is also all over the place; I checked twice my watch to see how much time's left, and parents all around did the same. From a Super Mario BROTHERS movie Luigi is absent in about 80% of the movie, Mario has more screentime from which half the time is being outdone by Peach and degraded to a side character in his own movie.This flick cannot even tie the shoelace of Puss in the boots: The last wish, and is easily one of the worst movie Illumination produced so far.","

As it should have been! The game features transferred to the movie perfectly. Adult puns and jokes in there as well as ones the kids will get.Cheeky, little, cute Post Scene Credit (which as Marvel fans we know to hang around to see if there was one).Our seven year old son thought it was amazing and he only knows Mario Kart in the gaming world. So it's appealing all round for adults (nostalgia) for kids (pure fun).","

I love the visuals and animation. It's really accurate to modern games and also has references to Previous Mario games and other games made by Nintendo. The soundtrack was really catchy (That even got My all time favorite 80's song Take on Me in the movie and It was playing in the Kong Kingdom scene) Some scenes made me laugh (We don't even need Toilet humor to make people laugh) Charles martinez who voiced Mario and Luigi even was in the movie and the most surprising thing was we get to see Mario and Luigi's Family. I honestly do not see any flaws in the movie not gonna lie. Overall a really great video game movie and the one who broke the video game curse the most.","

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","7 September 2023","This was a movie that I was intrigued about when I heard it was being made. I grew up with the Super Mario Brothers video game for the regular Nintendo. Getting Mario 3 was a big deal and I remember playing the game with my sister, cousins and even my father. The Mario games have been part of my life at different times. Jaime and I watched this on a Sunday morning for something light.The crux of this movie is that Bowser (voiced by Jack Black) takes the super star from the Penguin King (Khary Payton) to impress Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). A flooding event leads Mario (Chris Pratt) and his brother Luigi (Charlie Day) into another world. The brothers are separated. Mario meets up with the princess to save him and her world.What makes this the best to me is all the references to the Mario games ranging from the original to kart. It seems like they even incorporate Super Mario RPG as well as the Donkey Kong Games. I wasn't sure how well this would work, but I think they do a great balance of references with doing their own things. It did well at the box office and of course, is set up for a sequel. I'd watch it.Now I do know there was a bit of a backlash in having Pratt voice the titular character, since he isn't Italian. There are those that also felt it was a slap in the face of Charles Martinet, who brought such life to the character with Super Mario 64. I didn't mind it. They don't go over the top and I just like Pratt. The best voice though is making Luigi neurotic with Day. I liked seeing Taylor-Joy along with Black, Payton, Martinet, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, and Fred Armisen. The voice talent is just amazing across the board here.This is also well-made. I'm glad that we have a combination of new school animation while giving a feel of what I grew up on. Again, paying homage to the games with locations is a plus. I also like that a couple times they follow the action like a side-scrolling 2D game. That made me smile. I like the music. They reference multiple songs across games, which is great. I think they did a great job with taking something as beloved as what we get here. It truly is a feat. If you're a Mario fan, shut off your brain and go for the ride. It is worth it.My Rating: 8 out of 10.","

There was zero humor, all the best lines were in the trailer and it wasent just funny. The kids liked it a little but one of them just feel sleep.Illumination does great animation but lately they are lacking in the story side, nothing wrong with the design or animation but the humor just didn't work and they really need to hire better writers. It seems that they keep recycling the same humor as their previous movies.5/10 for the pretty animation, otherwise boring movie.","

"mike-c-b","15 July 2023","The complete absence of care.Mario & Luigi are treated like objects. Cliche one liners. No time to breathe. Only panic attacks. Bullying each other. Doing what they're told. Rush rush.Mario is not permitted to possess discipline, courage, imagination, heart, backbone, standards, have value in society and be proud. He hides, has anxiety, and wins by chance.Villains are worshipped. Allowed the breathe. Parade. Be the victim.All scenes have the single most cliche music possible.The start of the film puts you in a panic and blows your synapses using panic music, one-second cuts, and the sense of doom. It's also shot to put you on the side of the villain - before there is even a victim introduced yet. What are you supposed to think? Doom is exciting, interesting, and worth watching?The villains aren't shot with a backstory except for ""shock & awe"". Even in lord of the rings, villains were shot as slaves.Why make the film?","

Universal Pictures and Nintendo games did a pretty good job making this movie happen for the fans.Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor Joy, Seth Rogen, and Jack Black did a solid job with there voice performances, I mean I guess I can't complain about the accents of Mario and Luigi, but to me I think it was a pretty good idea once you get use to there acting skills. And I gotta admit, it was pretty better than the original version that was made in 1993.What I really liked about this movie, is how they actually added many different cool video game references once you compare to other Super Mario Nintendo games. After all, Super Mario Bros. Movie is such an enjoyable video game movie ever made, and it'll feel like your playing Super Mario Bros games all over again!LET'S A GO!!!","

"bradleyaitken","5 April 2023","This movie is a mario fans dream movie, with many Easter eggs from all the games to the plot being something different than the same save the princess plot. It shocked me how good this film is and deserves to be the best video game movie of all time. Though it was quite fast paced which made it a nine out of ten for me. But thats the only bad thing about it. Besides chris pratt mario. With the funny jokes and references to other games, this truly is a fantastic movie which i highly recommend to people who read this to go watch. You will not be disappointed by this film. Nintendo fans would enjoy this more since there's more understanding on whats going on with non nintendo gamers not knowing the references in the movie. With the best part being the fact they finally showed us where the blue shell came from. When the blue shelled koopa used it on Mario and donkey kong to stop them. Overall, a amazing experience that i will never forget. This is a really wholesome movie to me, how much detail and story that was crammed into a 92 minute movie. Some parts even made me cry just from being so nostalgic to me. I was there with the series when i got my hands on a DS and Wii back when i was young, the memories i made playing those mario games came back through this movie. Thats why its this good, the childhood memories of playing on your DS and Wii games that are Mario games really make this movie more fun to watch and understand. Like how Mario and Luigi throughout their whole life, people telling them they won't succeed. But show them that when there together, nothing is impossible. And felt that connection with my own brother since i was always being picked on when i was small but he was there to protect me like how when young Luigi was building a castle out of bricks and another kid destroys it and Mario comes help him. Thats why this movie is great. It has some really good backstory elements sprinkled in there. The super Mario bros movie is something you don't want to miss out on.","

"The_Coffee_Frog","5 April 2023","I have been a huge 'Mario' fan pretty much all my life, from a little kid until now, I still eagerly anticipate the release of the new games, I think 'Super Mario Odyssey' is a gaming masterpiece, so needless to say, I was immensely curious about this movie considering the original 'Mario' film still lives in infamy for being so terrible, and the fact this film was being made by one of my least favourite animation studios, Illumination, the people responsible for unleashing the Minions onto the world. My expectations were rock-bottom, but then the trailers started releasing and......it looked good, nothing groundbreaking, but I thought it would be along the lines of last year's second 'Sonic' film. I suddenly became really excited for a passable family film with great references and pretty solid humour.....which is still significantly better than Illumination's current output.Unfortunately, I found the 'Mario' movie to be a gargantuan disappointment, both critically and as a fan.The film's premise is very simple, when Mario and his brother Luigi get sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom and get separated, Mario works with the land's Princess, Princess Peach and a mushroom guy called Toad, to rescue his brother and save the land from the evil Bowser who seeks to rule it.This premise, is very similar to the video games it's based on, but unlike last year's 'Sonic' which uses the games' bare-bones story and expands upon it with classic story beats, while infusing pre-established series lore (I.e., Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles), the 'Mario' movie instead chooses to keep the plot as bare-bones as the games, now, this isn't inherently bad, though a bland story can be draining to watch for an hour and a half, but if the film's humour and characters are good enough it can be entertaining, however, this is another instance in which the film fails.The film's humour is disappointing....despite a few instances of genuinely funny interactions, mostly coming from Jack Black's lovelorn Bowser, a vast majority of the gags are very Illumination, they're the kind of jokes that a long-distant uncle might make, or a teacher, just the blandest, most generic instances of comedy....like a Sunday comic strip from the 1940s that send kids and parents looking for an easy laugh off, but lack any real thought or craft, at least, though, there are not fart jokes, a mainstay in Illumination's filmography.The characters are very bland too, every character is slotted neatly into an archetype and is not allowed to leave that for second to show even the slightest degree of depth, the characters are, in fact, giving more depth in certain video games, such as the 'Luigi's Mansion' or the 'Paper Mario' series, this results in barely any eternal conflict for the characters, which, on top of a bland story makes the film drag on even more. All of this topped off with pacing that moves faster than a bullet bill, which makes everything feel like a sugar-induced fever dream and, some characters who are shockingly missing, even from brief cameos.The writing is truly abysmal: the film's narrative isn't compelling in the slightest, the emotional stakes fall flat on their face, it doesn't feel at all like the characters go on a journey, everything feels empty and generic. There isn't a soul here, everything feels mass-produced.There are some positives though, the animation is really good, particularly the background animation and character design, the characters animation could have been a bit more expressive at points in my option. The score, too, was really great, the orchestral remixes of the games' iconic music is heavenly, the voice acting is surprisingly solid, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Chris Pratt and Keegan Micheal-Key are top-notch with their delivery, though, as much as I enjoy Anya Taylor-Joy as an actor, she currently anyway, isn't the best voice actor, her delivery never felt authentic to me, and, of course there are some great references, even some non-Mario ones which greatly pleased a Nintendo nerd like me.Overall, the 'Mario' movie was a disappointing experience for me, I went in expecting nothing more than a fun time with a few good jokes akin to 'Sonic 2', but instead I got a sugary pile of slop, that I can't see anyone under the age of 10 enjoying.","

"NinaSayers666","16 April 2023","It's barely even a movie, given it functions mostly as a big, long ad for Nintendo products (Mario games, in this case). It has that lovely Illumination™ style of humor throughout it all, the stunning shallow writing we've all grown to love from them, and the immaculate character development we certainly expect to be blown away by. It's awful, really. There are so many plot points that make zero sense and function merely as a way of getting the film moving without really adding anything to the story, it all feels infinitely pointless and hollow.At least the world they built is pretty, that's the one positive.","

"judealexharnett","19 November 2023","This movie wasn't bad, it wasn't good either though, it was just alright. Everything about it was alright. Whole the story itself felt pretty weak I feel a lot of people sat there and said I know that character or wow what a cool Easter egg, and thats why people enjoyed it so much. The movie itself sacrifices a lot of good storytelling to focus on these Easter eggs and nostalgia. A lot of the characters are really underdeveloped and I was so unmotivated to root for either of the Mario brothers. And idk who decide to cast Chris pratt as Mario but it felt so strange but Jack black definitely hard carried as bowser. 6.8/10.","

"bulgerpaul","6 April 2023","A 90 minute game of ""spot the reference"" wherein all of the references pertain exclusively to a single 30 year running video game series that will appeal to absolutely nobody outside of young children with no attention spans and adults who've played literally every single entry in the series...so it's a good thing I've played literally every Mario game, multiple times.But aside from spotting some of the hilariously subtle Easter eggs peppered throughout the movie, and identifying which games they came from, yeah, it's bad. I know defenders of this thing will only respond to criticisms of thin characterization pointing out the characters in the games are thin too, however, the games are content to leave their characters entirely undeveloped, and instead just giving them broad personality traits conveyed through facial expressions and body language, and I can envision a Mario movie in which non-characters with heavily animated personalities can be successful, however, instead of opting not to develop the characters at all, illumination instead under-develops them, which to me is significantly worse. At one point we're given a random emotional beat from Donkey Kong where he wants to be seen as somebody who does more than smash things, a beat that is given no buildup and no legwork is put in in order to place that beat into a broader character arc. We're teased with an origin story for Princess Peach that never pays off. Mario and Luigi are given inadequacy complexes brought on by fears their father is disappointed in them that gets dropped throughout the entire second act before resurfacing very suddenly in the third act. And the list goes on.Had illumination merely wanted to replicate the excitement of the games by throwing us directly into an abstract action comedy romp using the mushroom kingdom as their toy box, I'd have been perfectly satisfied with that, however, instead we're given a litany of half baked characters sporting either set-ups with no pay-offs, or pay-offs with no setup.","

"TheNamelessCzar","10 April 2023","This movie is simply just another example of a movie studio, trying to make a few bucks. They try to capitalize on the popularity of the video game, but failed to understand what it takes to actually make a movie. There is no character exposition or world building. It is just one video game reference after another in an attempt to hold your attention without realizing that there really is no plot. Granted, I never played the video game to any degree, but I shouldn't have to to be able to enjoy a movie about it. It wasn't a bad movie, but it was a very good one either. A little bit more thought and work could've made it a decent film.","

"RussHog","6 April 2023","I try to review this from lens of a kid and as a kids film. It's a bad kids movie. It moves too fast. Fails to develop the characters in any meaningful way. The plot is lost and convoluted. Princess Peach looks weird. Cross-eyed. It tries too hard to fit too many video game components into the movie instead of focusing on the story. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is BAD. Mario himself is easily the worst part of the movie. Some kudos to Jack Black's Bowser and the turtle kingdom elements which are the best part of this film - but it could the used a lot more. The animation in this film is good - so four out of ten stars for that.","

"KinoBuff2021","4 December 2023","'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' (2023) is fun. Fans and casuals of the Mario franchise will certainly be entertained with the dazzling visuals and countless Easter Eggs and references to all sorts of games/media from Mario and Nintendo. But if you've never played a Mario game you might feel a little out of place as the film is based around these references to the games people have grown up with.The animation is amazing and the visuals give it such as a cinematic feel its just dazzling at times. Enough for you to wish the film was longer so you can watch the Mushroom Kingdom live in action. Unfortunately the story is pretty simple and fast-pace, but still entertaining. The voice acting is better than what people were expecting from the voice-actor reveal. Jack Black as Bowser is for sure the highlight.The film is definitely worth watching for anyone who has played a Mario game as you will quickly have enough fun to just spot the countless references throughout the film. Newbies may feel awkward but the visuals are good enough to keep you or more likely a kid entertained.ALSO, watch till the very end for some great mid-credits and post-credits scenes!","

"TheMustardNerd","7 May 2023","This is gonna be one of my shorter reviews, since the movie isn't bad, neither great.The voice acting was surprinsingly good. Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, and Anna Taylor-Joy were my favourites. Chris Pratt as Mario worked pretty well, since this is a new take on the plumber.The visuals were good: colorful enviorements, beautiful effects and entertaining action.T
But the main problem with the movie is it's lenght. In 80 minutes, you don't get that much out of it. It feels like they had a script for a 2 hour movie , but it was shortened to not bore the kids in the audience and to save some cash.The movie features a lot of locations, but it's pretty lackluster in it's world building since we barely spend any time in those. The dialogue is extremely limited and the scenes go by so fast, that many times, they become somewhat irrelevant to the plot. Since the characters got out of a sticky situation with so much ease, it fails to make you care about anything. How am I supposed to care for Mario since he defeats his enemies with so much ease. Same with Peach: she just gets into sticky situations, but a few seconds later she just gets out of it with the help of some deus ex machina crap.There's no set up, no polished character arcs, there's no pay-off, no forshadowing, almost anything.The characters are flat, boring, and lacking in personality. Their relationships don't feel authentic, cause they barely spend any time together. The movie is so short that they spend like 30 minutes togehter (in the best case scenario, sometimes it can be less than 10 minutes) and at the end you're expected to feel like they formed some great friendship, to feel that they have chemistry and things in common beyond: their humans, they want to defeat the same villain.Also it has a lot of Mario Stuff I guess....The reception for this movie was kinda pathetic. It was either pretentious critics, acting like this movie killed cinema or some trash, or a bunch of manchildren who need everyone to agree with them ""What did you expect from a Mario Movie?"". From the Mario Movie. You would expect... a movie: a story with conflicts that pay off. Likeable characters and immersive world-building. It's a movie; of course I expect to me more complex than the Mario Games.I honestly didn't k=connect with the movie. I was just waiting for it to end. I didn't even intend to watch it until the internet decided that this is some ground breaking divisive movie. It's not. Maybe it's gonna leave a big impact on the industry, since in made over a billion dollars, but I highly doubt I'm gonna remember this movie once The Flash or the FNAF movie will come out, and people will move on to the next big shiny thing.With both terrible and good stuff, the movie is OK: a low-key waste of time, with mildly entertaining scenes and bright colors. I don't see anyone outside of Mario Fans and Families getting that out of this.","

"influxtwo","10 April 2023","I was born in the late 80s. So I had a first-hand perspective of being a quintessential 90s kid as far as Nintendo & their Mario releases were concerned.I used to wake up before 6am to watch the Mario animated series airing alongside the Zelda & Donkey Kong shows.I used to play & beat the first 3 games & their consecutive Mario World games & other spin-offs. I even like the original Live-Action Mario film a lot still to this day, despite it's varying degree of separation.This new film I obviously then had to see on the big screen and I honestly got to say I wish I had saved my money and took a nap instead.Don't get me wrong, I can't hate it, and I won't. It started out so good, with so much potential. And I just feel by the end, it wasn't anything special.The voice-acting, on nearly all fronts actually took me out of it, and continued to distract me while the movie became one more noisy eruption rampaging through every scene, after another. Toad & Peach were tolerable in their roles. But I couldn't take the voice-acting seriously for Mario, Luigi, & Bowser, Dk, etc.By the end the noisy nostalgia quickly became almost unbearable and although the fan-service was locked in place, it wasn't enough for me to really care.This film, particularly towards the end, felt like one for the kids, & true meta nerds, don't get me wrong, but it was just missing good pacing in my opinion, and the voice-acting, I'm sorry to say, butchered what could have been a masterpiece.The visuals somewhat worked, but the chaotic and rushed story was like a Wizard of Oz acid trip that I actually quite wanted a lot more out of. The stakes weren't high for a Mario movie, the voice-acting was bad... if there's a sequel, I just hope it's a-better.I can just proclaim that I'm happy that many fans are able to disagree with me and look past any & all perceived weaknesses.I will just hold closer to the games.","

"abalpn-99472","8 April 2023","It's been three decades since I've watched the live-action film in 1993 and it became a major flop. Almost 30 years. Not to mention that there was an animated film that was in 1986 but it was only in Japan. The fans wanted another film or an animated reboot. Now in 2023, it finally happened. This animated film is even better than the live-action version. This is the true film that the Nintendo fans wanted to see. My brother and I just came back from watching the movie and we enjoyed it very much. The action sequences were amazing and phenomenal. They blend very well with the animation. There were funny moments and emotional parts that made me want to cry. I liked the story and plot of the movie. In most of the games that we played, Mario and Luigi would rescue Peach from Bowser. They switch it so Mario has to rescue his brother with the help from Peach. There were two sides of the film's story. One side shows that Mario cares for Luigi. And the other side is that Luigi has a chance to shine for himself. Peach is very brave and confident in this film and it was interesting. There were games that Peach and Toad joined Mario and Luigi in adventures.The animation is fantastic and spectacular. Even the characters as well. Illumination worked very well to design and draw the animation so I'm giving kudos to them. The movie had all the references and easter eggs from the games that I played throughout the years. I'm glad that the movie included the musical themes from all the games and even the sound effects. I'm giving credit to Koji Kondo for his brilliant work of composing the themes. Brian Tyler is a good choice to compose the entire soundtrack to the movie. He did plenty of composing for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.We know that Charles Martinet voiced Mario and Luigi throughout the years but the directors casted Chris Pratt. They thought that Chris was the best actor to voice Mario because of his roles of animated films like The Lego Movie or Disney/Pixar's Onward. Chris did not try to voice Mario like from the games. That's probably what the directors wanted him to say and do. They probably know about the voice that Martinet did over the years. Charles Martinet is in this movie as only other voices. If they casted Charles Martinet to voice both Mario and Luigi, then it would be too much for him in the voicing booth. My brother and I were skeptical about Chris Pratt being the voice of Mario but when we watched him in action he was not that bad. Chris did on and off as Mario and being himself. Chris did sort of had a Brooklyn accent. It is just like the DIC cartoons from the late 1980's and early 1990's. I kept in mind when I was watching the film it was just like watching those cartoons again. So I was okay with Chris being the voice of Mario. Charlie Day is great as the voice of Luigi. Jack Black really nailed his role of voicing Bowser; he was definitely the perfect role for the cast and he made his voice very intimidating just like in one of the games. Seth Rogen is hilarious as Donkey Kong. Anya is beautiful as the princess. Keegan is awesome as Toad. Kevin Michael Richardson nailed his role of voicing Kamek. I know Kevin from other voice actor roles. Overall, I did not mind about the voice cast. What matters to me is seeing this animated movie and the characters in action.I've noticed that the movie is about an hour and not that long. The whole production should have thought about putting more plots into the story, but Illumination does not make their movies for about two hours long. It is okay for my brother and me because this was worth the wait to see it. This animated movie does honor the legacy of the entire Nintendo franchise. There are Nintendo fans who are young or old that waited to see this movie and enjoy it in theaters. This is also a movie for families to enjoy watching because it does feel like a family movie. That's what Illumination does. So, if you're a fan, watch the movie and enjoy it. I cannot wait for other future sequels or spin-offs. Who knows? Probably there will be more. I rate this movie 10 stars (⭐) and giving it two thumbs up. 👍👍","

"Seb_3","7 December 2023","This is definitely mostly targeted towards kids, in that aspect it does a tremendous job. It quickly paces along from set piece to set piece, while referencing the many games in the series, a great introduction to new comers and a fun watch for fans.Ultimately it doesn't have layers upon layers as to appeal to an older audience, and the animation isn't spectacular. There is a lot of bright colors, funny quirks and fast paced clips and cuts. The voice of Luigi is great and sounds exactly like you would expect, while I was a bit worried about Chris Pratt as Mario, his voice grew on me and it wasn't as distracting as I feared. Jack Black as bowser was absolutely outstanding doing an amazing job capturing the quirky and ""funny"" side, balancing that withIt does bring references that nintendo lovers and fans of the Mario franchise, and the cast of characters that are closely connected to the franchise. While the movie isn't revolutionary in any way, it's a fun time especially for kids, that passes along at an astronomical pace.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","22 April 2023","Filled with a litany of references to all things Mario, this vibrant animated adaptation is sure to please fans of its source video-game series. 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)' really is perhaps everything you'd want from a video-game adaptation, displaying a deep reverence for its inspiration while interweaving its homages - both aesthetic and narrative - directly into the story it wants to tell. As an adaptation, this is perhaps unrivalled; as a movie, I've seen far better. The story is really weak, a barely-there A-to-B that feels designed purely to get from set-piece to set-piece and doesn't any take time to stop and smell the roses. It's like the narrative only exists to cram as many Easter eggs and references as possible into the movie's relatively slim frame. It isn't the most natural way of exploring its world and it means that its characters are rather perfunctory in the grand scheme of things. The relentless pacing doesn't translate to a gripping experience, either. To be honest, the flick just sort of happens in front of you. It's not bad, just not particularly good. The visuals are its clear highlight, with atmospheric cinematography and lively animation that puts the rest of Illumination's lineup to shame, and the voice acting is mostly strong across the board (Christ Pratt is still an odd choice as the lead, though). Ultimately, I'm a little torn on the experience. On one hand, it's a breezy and aesthetically pleasing adventure that undeniably captures the spirit of its inspiration, but, on the other, it isn't compelling in the slightest and is very basic when it comes to its narrative. It's a pretty strong adaptation, but a fairly weak movie. It's fine.","

"suzasailor","5 April 2023","When I was a kid I remember anticipating the new Super Mario Bros movie... boy what a letdown that was. So this new one had to be good right?I'm watching it with my family, staring at the screen, and feeling nothing through most of the run time. Just bright colors and movement. The problem was. The screenplay is just cliff notes with fan service. The movie should have stuck with the brothers and traveled throughout the mushroom kingdom and other worlds and save the princess. Simple right? But A lot of the time It felt busy and empty simultaneously. Maybe I'm being too hard on a kid's movie? Why should I complain? It's not the 90s Mario movie, right?Wasted potential, that's how I felt. The movie never really took off for me. It didn't have those wow moments that it could have easily had. No surprises, just safe commercial entertainment.Pros:
The visuals and music are top-notch. As a big fan of the games, these elements hit home.Jack Black's Bowser was the best part of the movie. When he is onscreen it's a joy to watch. Luigi and Toad are also very good. There are a few moments toward the end that are exciting too. When the Mario Bros are together, they work... however.Cons:
The bros being separated for most of the movie was one of the biggest mistakes of the film. You get an entertaining Luigi and do absolutely nothing with him. Donkey Kong could've been completely removed as he brought nothing. There was a little too much Mario Kart. Princess Peach was fine but again there was too much of her and we really don't get to know her. For most of the movie, it felt like it was on autopilot and they had a checklist of items that they had to go through. There needed more quiet moments to let the audience breathe in this magical world. It felt less like an adventure/journey and more like Super Mario highlights.Overall, it comes down to the screenplay, which could have told an interesting tale of these Bros' adventure to save the mushroom kingdom, but when you don't really care about the characters and get a movie that takes too many warp zones to the end. You end up with this half-baked film.4/10.","

"grantlauzon","4 December 2023","What if he said ""Nobody gets away from General Blue Shell!""Sometimes not explaining something is better. ""He's Mr. Nimbus he controls the police."" It's funny because it forces the viewer to ask how does he control the police or why does it only work on police. It's silly and makes no sense but the suspension of disbelief makes it work.In Mario Kart the Blue Shell power up lets you throw a shell that's blue that flies to whoever's in first place and blows up. In this movie a blue koopa is fighting Mario and after Mario beats him the Blue Shell Koopa says ""blue shell"" and then flies towards Mario and blows up.Why did he say ""blue shell""? He has a blue shell but what does that mean to him or the audience. Audience members who know Mario Kart will know what is happening when he flies forward and blows up. Audience members who don't will see him fly forwards and blow up.If he said ""Nobody gets away from General Blue Shell!"" Then that would add depth to the character that was fighting Mario. The audience would know that he's special in some way. It's like if Naruto looked at the camera, said ""Naruto!"" Then used his Rasengan. Why would Naruto say his name as if it was his signature move? Or like if at the end of Dirty Harry, Harry looked at the villain and said ""Dirty Harry"" then blew the guys head off.It might seem like I'm obsessed with this but this is what the whole movie is like. There's so much detail and texture to this world that it implies a deep history and world building without having any of it. The Blue Shell Koopa doesn't have a name but he felt the need to say or explain or proclaim ""blue shell"" as if it means anything to anybody. Was he trying to impress himself or was it a proclamation that he is of the blue shell family and they are to be feared. IDK.Why does DK have a state of the art Go Kart factory when everything in the Jungle Kingdom is made out of wood stone and gold? Maybe DK's obsession with racing (instead of ruling) is one of the reasons why his father is disappointed in him. It would be cool if that was the case but it's never stated.The world looks like it makes sense to the people who live there but really it's just ""blue shell"" cuz mario.","

"TheVictoriousV","7 April 2023","In my review of HBO's The Last of Us, I wrote that we've entered a golden age of the once-cursed category of ""video game adaptations"". A favored explanation for why movies and shows based on games seem to get better is that, well, a lot of the titles that get adapted are already trying to be pretty cinematic, ergo it's easier to translate the characterizations and drama to the screen. (Some parts of the aforementioned Last of Us are shot-for-shot recreations of the game's cutscenes.)But this doesn't account for the hype around adaptations of things like Sonic the Hedgehog and now Super Mario Bros., which were always more about gameplay than story -- especially when they were brand new. We play Mario's games because we want to jump on blocks, drive karts around, and crush turts; not for intricate plotting or enthralling cutscenes. So why is it that everyone had high hopes for the new Mario feature?Well, one big factor is how faithful it looks. The last time we saw the eponymous Italian plumber star in a big-screen release, we got the murky 1993 film where King Koopa was just Dennis Hopper with a knobbly bald cap and none of the creatures looked right (which is to say nothing of the relationship that the Mario brothers -- who were also ""father and adoptive son"" and possibly something more -- seemed to have in that one).The new movie, for the most part, looks unabashedly identical to the games (minus Mario's shrunken keister, the most derided video-game-movie design choice since Sonic's human teeth in 2020). It doesn't stray away from the feel of them just to make it ""work better as a movie"" or whatever (it does make some changes, obviously, but none so bad as, say, giving Angry Birds a backstory involving refugee allegories, interventionist themes, and somehow also clowns). Even that one rap song -- which would normally stick out as a desperate, wannabe-hip, probably studio-imposed addendum -- is actually lifted from a DIC Entertainment/Saban Productions Mario cartoon that many veteran gamers grew up with. There's sincerity to the project.Of course, there are some things that seem like they came from a focus group meeting rather than a creative mind, like the faint girlboss-ification of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Mario being played by Chris Pratt doing his best Chris Pratt. Now, Pratt isn't a bad voice actor, and boy does he put his heart into that ""wahoo"", but nothing here justifies him being cast instead of, I dunno, Charles Martinet (who does have a cameo).Still, nobody really stands out as a flat-out poor casting choice -- Charlie Day is entertaining as Luigi, Jack Black is heaps of fun as Bowser/King Koopa, Seth Rogen works as Donkey Kong, even Keegan-Michael Key works well as Toad, the lil' mushroom guy. My problems with the movie are to do with its comedy, its rushed pacing, and its unremarkable visuals.This is Illumination Entertainment so it's foolish to expect anything above ""technically well-rendered"" and ""inoffensively cute"", but one feels that Mario deserves better. And we, as connoisseurs of animation, should probably demand more in an age that has given us the likes of Puss in Boots, Arcane, and Into the Spider-Verse, all of them exemplifying energetic 3D animation that looks like it lept from the realm of 2D -- an effect that baffles even my VFX-programmer dad, especially how it's achieved in Puss in Boots, with its anime-esque battles.But most impressive about Puss -- and its effect on filmgoers -- was that it made everyone excited at the prospect of another Shrek movie. Yes, it actually made people want MORE of something for once. And by people, I mean actual people; not social media bots that feign excitement at Disney's zillionth ""live-action remake"" announcement, nor their cognitive equals that run interchangeable Disney fan pages. Even more relevant is Arcane, which is certainly one of the biggest contributors to the consensus ""video game adaptations are cool now"". That was Mario's competition here, not the 1993 attempt. Something that almost exclusively excites fanboys feels like a step back.Will this movie re-sour the idea of video game movies? Not at all. But it likely won't make moviegoers hunger for more Nintendo films the way that Puss made us hype up Shrek 5, either. We'll see. I still observe some of the aforementioned hype, but it seems to be dying down (when it came out, we had our laughs about its low Tomatometer score, as we were urged to take it with a grain of salt since this is the website where Cuties has a ""Fresh"" rating, but even non-critics have begun to doll out negative reviews).My verdict will have to be that it's just a nice little kiddie movie, albeit one that will likely be forgotten by children and manchildren alike. What was I saying? Anyways, did you see those trailers for Spider-Verse 2 and the new Ninja Turtles? Pretty cool, right? I'll see if there are tickets yet!","

"brainb-47848","9 April 2023","Super Mario Brothers (2023) is a story about two brothers, who have just started a plumbing business (after quitting working for a competing plumbing company) and must work together with the inhabitants of a newfound realm, in order to save the universe.Whoever thinks that Super Mario brothers had a thin plot was NOT paying attention. Mario goes on what can be described as the hero's journey. Luigi learns to trust his brother (while finding his individual strength). Princess Peach must put her diplomacy and years of combat training to use, in order to save her kingdom, found family, and friends. Donkey Kong learns the importance of humility and friendship. The supporting and (even) background characters were well-placed and well-setup. The movie sets up a possible sequel, in which Mario and Luigi (and the rest will grow even more).This movie packed a great many morals into one story. Such morals include: the importance of family (siblings, father's love, found family, etc...), earned trust, the importance of training and other preparation, doing and eating things that are good for us (even if we do not like them), friendship, perseverance, importance of being able to handle romantic rejection, teamwork, humility, forgiveness, importance of mechanical training, etc...Pros - plot, animation, world mechanics are displayed and told well enough (for anyone new to the Mario world), characters, soundtrack, references were not forced, clean, not ""meta,"" good morals, (part of the first part of the plot reminded me of the 1993 movie)Con - a few of the big mushrooms looked like their red parts were made out of clothThis movie was very well done. I give it 10.5/11.","

"chenp-54708","5 April 2023","I grew up playing various Mario games on the DS and Wii, alongside watching ""The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!"", the anime film adaptation and yes, even the hilariously god awful live-action film. The games, films, and shows about Mario and Luigi were part of my childhood and I was curious to see where this one was going. After seeing it, there were fun moments but it was kind of underwhelming.The animation models and color, sound design, and effects are absolutely gorgeous as the colors and style really captures the essence of the world and personality. The character model
designs are really good, particularly Bowser, Princess Peach and Donkey Kong and the soundtrack added is also really catchy. The action scenes like the fight with Mario and Donkey Kong and the kart racing sequence were well-executed and perfectly captures the tone and accuracy of the games. The animation was made from Illumination whom I am not fond of at all but here, they knocked it out of the park and I think it's some of their best animation so far. Throughout, the sound designs were also pretty good.The narrative is okay. I appreciate the narrative and setting remaining faithful to the source material, but I kind of wished the narrative could have expanded and explored itself a little more. I understand it's bare bones because it's for younger viewers and fans but there are so many fun concepts and stories about the Super Mario World that I thought could have been implemented. Surprisingly, the voice performances were a mix of good and kind of bad. Jack Black, Anya-Taylor Joy and Keegan-Michael Key were excellent as their voice performances helped to make their characters interesting and fun. On the other hand, Chris Pratt's voice performance felt wooden and didn't fit the personality of Mario and Seth Rogen and Charlie Day's voice performances were pretty annoying which made it a little difficult to believe a single word from them.The characters remain the same classic characters we enjoy watching and I do appreciate the writers not completely butchering them. The dialogue moments were a little rough, the soundtrack was kind of repetitive, and the humor wasn't great as some were clever but most were pretty bad as if they were written from a SML or SMG4 video. There were many Mario related easter eggs throughout and some were cleverly used but it ended up feeling repetitive as if they are just references rather than to utilize them cleverly. However, the film still manages to not be boring as there were some pretty fun moments.Overall, I appreciate the studio for respecting the source material and it was never boring. But I'd rather stick to watching the original television show.","

"whackamolewv","9 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie was amazing! We needed this movie! The computer-generated imagery animation was amazing! And surprisingly, Chris Pratt did an amazing job on voicing Mario in this movie! And I also found out Chris Pratt is voicing Garfield for the 2024 Garfield Movie, so hopefully he does a good job on voicing Garfield! I honestly get entertained by both Mario and Garfield! Before this movie was announced, I've never imagined Nintendo and Illumination would make an incredible movie like this! It would honestly be funny if Mario met the Minions from Despicable Me because it's an Illumination movie, but something like that wouldn't have to happen because this movie is all about Mario, not Despicable Me. Thanks for this movie!","

"NeonRust","5 April 2023","The story isn't deep? It's for CHILDREN!!! It's a Mario movie for crying out loud. It's not FOR you. It's made for children to enjoy but has plenty of references and nostalgia so that parents can sit along and not wanna blow their brains out being dragged to a child's movie.It doesn't need a deep plot for it to be good for what it is. It actually takes the damsel in distress trope of (all) the Mario games and flips it on the head; Luigi is the one captured and Peach is a badass.The worry about Chris Pratt that people had was for naught. He sounds great and it makes sense for the context of the film. All the cast does a great job. If I didn't know Peach was played by Anya Taylor-Joy I would never have guessed. Same for Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Charlie Day, Seth Rogen and Jack Black are instantly recognisable but that isn't a knock. Their voices fit really well. Especially Jack Black as Bowser. I can't imagine anyone else doing as good a job with the character.The action pieces are super fun, the jokes mostly landed which surprised me, and the film is stunning. Every shot is beautiful. You really buy into their world.The references to the Mario games and just video games in general are perfect and virtually infinite. From sound effects, to the score, to tiny details in the background. It seems there's something every other 30 seconds to have a cheeky smirk at, to think ""I got that"".My main criticism is the pacing. Often today, I find too many scenes to drag on or seem out of place. This isn't it's problem. The opposite intact. I felt like it blasts you over and over with new information. You never get much of a chance to settle and fully admire the joke or the action in the scene.The ending of the film too also reminded me a lot of the second Sonic movie, but that's just the nature of how these adaptions need to be.My other main criticism would be the lack of heart the film as compared to say the Sonic movies. But again, I'm not necessarily the film's target audience. So it's not too big of a complaint.Overall me, my partner and my 4 year old son (dressed as Mario I may add) had a blast with this in the cinema and absolutely look forward to more in the future.And all this comes from a Sega kid who never understood the appeal of Mario until this past Christmas when my son got a Nintendo Switch.","

"simianfriday","5 April 2023","This movie was quite a letdown for me. I went in with high hopes, expecting a fun romp with characters I've known and loved for decades, and an enjoyable story to match - something akin to the first Lego Movie some years ago.Unfortunately, the entire movie is like watching a 90 minute commercial / highlight reel. There is basically no story to speak of - it's just 90 minutes of Mario doing Mario things, with some silly jokes thrown in here and there. It will certainly entertain kids - and that's ultimately the point I guess. I was just hoping for something that would also be an entertaining story for long time fans like myself - like the Lego Movie was - this definitely misses that mark and is not something I'd ever want to watch again, nor would I care to see a sequel.The animation is beautiful, some of the jokes do land, the clever references are fun to spot, and the casting is actually not as bad as people feared - Chris Pratt is fine. Not great, but fine. Jack Black, Charlie Day, and Keegan-Michael Key are all quite good in their roles - most of the rest of the supporting cast is also decent, with Seth Rogan and Fred Armisen being the only truly poor casting decisions.Your kids will probably love it - but there's little chance adults will do more than tolerate it.","

"moemenamaneman","8 April 2023","Nintendo is very protective of their copyrights and characters, including the game publisher's favorite portly plumber, Mario. If you ask anyone, they could tell you why. In the wave of Nintendo mania, the 80s and 90s were littered with sub-par products to capitalize on their success in the video game market. Things like the oft-lampooned 1993 Mario Bros film and the memetic CD-i games are just a few of the lapses in good judgment the company displayed during this time. Frankly, I don't blame them for playing it close to the chest when it comes to their properties.The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a direct reflection of that hesitance to branch out. It is a product to advertise before all else. Nintendo gave this to Illumination because they knew they were the people for the job. They knew they could produce the most generic, yet profitable ""product loaf"" imaginable. They likely gave the studio three criteria when making the movie: fill it with references, make their theme park look good, and stay in line. Anything else (memorable moments, good story, character development) were all tertiary or not a concern in the slightest. I don't doubt Miyamoto was heading this in the slightest, as any attempt to push Mario into even a slightly new direction or give characters any dimensions at all is thwarted by him.The voice-acting is Hollywood A/B-listers as the main cast instead of real voice actors. Again. What, was SUPER MARIO not enough to sell the movie? Some of the performances are better than others, but it all just sounds so bland. Some of them don't even try to do a voice (Anya Taylor-Joy, Seth Rogan). It really is a shame they don't get people who can actually say lines in a booth properly for these animated ""film products,"" but if that's what they think they need to do to get people in the seats, then whatever. It's far from the worst thing about the movie.The movie's greatest flaws, by far, are its writing and pacing. There were a few moments in this that were genuinely cringe-inducing. It pulls the movie down from pretty average 5/10 kids fare to downright awful. I'm not even exclusively referring to the references they embarrassingly try to mangle into dialogue. There are parts where two characters are just talking to each other that are so stilted and unnatural, that it makes me think this was written in an afternoon without even as much as a cursory look-through. That said, the references are just as unbearable in this. Lines like ""your princess is in another castle"" and ""it's on like Donkey Kong"" made my skin crawl. And they're all said with that smug ""wink-wink, that one's for the REAL fans"" tone. Gives me a headache. I promise you that the guy who wrote Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son and Minions: The Rise of Gru doesn't care about Mario Bros. I don't really mind the nods to the games (what else do you do with a Mario movie in 2023, after all), but I can't help but see this as a cynical way to drive interest in the 30-to-50-year-old manchild demographic. Consume product, fellow Mario fans.When it's not making surface-level references to the games or other Mario media, the movie rushes through its set-pieces like it's literally racing towards a finish line. The way they blitz through Peach's hack-writer-mandated sad backstory in less than a minute made me actually laugh out loud. The only laugh I had during the movie. They don't even stop to let the new, whimsical surroundings of the Mushroom Kingdom sink in. Mario adjusts so well to his new surroundings that you forget that he's a plumber from Brooklyn in a fantastical new world. Doesn't help that every 10 minutes there's a pop song playing to take you out of it. Another check mark checked off the animated kids film product list.All in all, the Super Mario Bros. Movie relies too heavily on references to distract from its terrible script and boring characters. Aside from a few good orchestral renditions of the classic OST, a handful of okay voice performances, and passable animation, there isn't anything here for you unless you're 10 or you have a shelf of Mario memorabilia and an overpriced Mario Lego set on your shelf. If ""it's a kids movie"" and ""it isn't supposed to be that deep"" are your only defenses for this ""movie,"" might I suggest playing a Mario game instead? They might lack a good story, but at least those are fun.","

"natemaid-60751","9 April 2023","I went into the theater fully prepared to like the Super Mario Brothers movie (although reading some of the middling reviews from MetaCritic tempered my expectations somewhat) and I walked away with a resounding feeling of 'meh'.This movie has what I would describe as a breakneck pace, bouncing between mediocre comedy, mediocre action scenes and soulless character moments. All the while sprinkling in iconic tracks from the video games alongside jukebox favorites which do not work at all; playing 'Take on Me' immediately after the Mario Kart theme gave me whiplash, as with a lot of this movie.","

"JayWolfgramm","24 June 2023","Nobody ever played the Mario Bros. Video games for the story. People play the games for some good simple fun. And there is nothing wrong with some mindless entertainment. So, when Nintendo announced that they were teaming up with Illumination to make this movie happen, it seemed like a solid match. Illumination seems to specialize in mindless films. Stuff like ""Minions"" and ""Secret Life of Pets"" are not exactly accused of being too high brow. And this movie, is exactly what you'd expect from a company like Illumination, telling a story like Mario.How did the movie fare in execution? Well, the animation is good. All movements are fluid, and the character designs are both faithful to the source and a suitable step up in detail quality.The music is also good. At least when it is doing unique movie spins on classic Nintendo music. When it is doing some tired pop song it feels out of place. The ""Peaches"" song is pretty sweet. And while I'm on that point, Jack Black is great at Bowser, no notes. He is both parts intimidating and funny.The other voice actors do...fine. Nothing spectacular but nothing awful. With the exception of Fred Armisen does not fit at all for Cranky Kong.The movie has a handful of jokes that work, but for the most part they could have used a power up. The movie goes at a breakneck pace, never giving their audience time to breath. The idea being that if the story goes fast enough, none of the children will get bored. But from my experience, I watched the film with 3 kids, ranging from 4-10, and they were checked out by about the hour mark. So, from my experience, the movie didn't even deliver for its target demographic.I mentioned that no one plays Mario for the story. Well, that is the difference between a video game and a movie. A video game can be mindless fun, because the player is the one going on the journey. The movie does not have that same luxury. What has helped Mario be the top of the video game world for all these decades is the fact that his video games are revolutionary. ""Super Mario Bros."" or ""Super Mario 64"" were both huge leaps forward in the industry. This Mario Bros. Movie does nothing game changing. It follows the same formula of so many other kids' movies. Some fun, but when this game is over, I don't want to press to continue.","

Why would bowser play piano in any way, shape, or form? (That was the only good part of the film), who thought it was a good idea to have Chris Pratt voice probably the most iconic video game character of all time?Back to that, Chris Pratt was legitimately horrible in this role and I didn't laugh even once, heavily being carried by Jack black and the peaches love song.F.","

It's amazing to be fully immersed in the Mario world.

It had all the parts of Mario we've all grown to love. It's a great start and I really can't wait for a Nintendo universe and a sequel to this movie!!","

"Mork_the_Borg","8 November 2023","Overall it's an okay movie, but not really much more than that. Could only rate it a 5/10, which is a shame really as I expected so much more from this movie. After giving it some thoughts I decided there are two reasons why the rating is lower than expected. The first one is the voices of the characters. With the exception of the highly depressing fire-spark sitting in its cage (or whatever it was), the voices seem mostly a rather bad choice. Think this might be related to the fact that the movie is trying to stay too politically correct by not stereotyping Italians, although really... serving pasta with mushroom sauce. Mario and Luigi should have had real super-strong Italian accents (Izze me di MA-rioooo fromme di Pizzaaaaaasss). The second reason is the lack of humour, the humour from for example a Shrek movie. Clearly Mariobros is not suitable for small children, and hence should have adapted itself to a much more mature audience. It kind of felt as flat as a Ghibli movie without the artistic feeling that Ghibli movies typically have. Maybe it's a Japan related culture thing, but honestly they should have hired some Brits to add some more spark to it. So, the movie wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either. Anyways, that's my two pennies worth.","

It's a kids movie that I feel all ages will enjoy, LOTS of jokes and about 90% of them I found funny and did laugh out loud a few times.I would have liked a bit more Toad, other than that yea I can't think of what I didn't like hahahha The movie is a good 7.5 but I'm rounding it to an 8 :) That may actually be it, another watch maybe, always a good sign I know I'll watch again just after seeing it.","

"Slarkshark","28 April 2023","Major reserves heading into this, but I can honestly say it wasn't bad.Some questionable choices for the voice actors. Chris Pratt was actually okay. Jack Black was great. I would not have chosen Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. He was good as Pumbaa, but as DK he was just Seth Rogan. Anya Taylor-Joy was fine as Peach, but of course they couldn't make her the damsel in distress. That's like so yesterday.Story line was decent. You got doses of Mario and Luigi through the years in many parts throughout the film, whether it was 'Luigi's Mansion', 'Mario Kart', or simply the older Super Mario games.Saw it with my 5 year old and he had a blast, so at the end of the day, mission accomplished.","

"AvionPrince16","5 April 2023","So i just saw the movie in the cinema and i need to say that im pretty disappointed. The movie just give a lot of references to all the mario games and others nintendo games ( mario kart, donkey kong.). But i need to say that i still dont understand that they made Brooklyn and made Mario and Luigi lived there: why? Wasnt supposed to be more easier to make us dive into the Mario world directly: i found that choice really off topic and dont bring anything except a waste of time and to know Mario parents dont really interested me at all. I mean the animation was really gorgeous and the animation work pretty well but i feel that movie was an interesting experience visually but the plot and the quest that didnt really find it interesting to be honest and was not necessary. And to see them talk take me time to dive into the movie. I found the comedy moments ok. It was not really funny but the comedy is still there for people who interested in this. We have basically a movie who give a multiple references without really keep out of their comfort zone like usually with nintendo games. It was ok but i just liked it mothing more and nothing less. An interesting visuals and animations but nothing more. A movie to see with the family for sure.","

"TheBadGamingBoy","5 April 2023","The short version of this review is that it's just about everything a Mario film could be. The long version? Read the review to find out.I'll start with the story. It's a very simple plot. Mario & Luigi fall into the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi is captured by Bowser and Mario has to rescue him. What you saw in the trailers for this film is exactly what you get. Something simple. Despite this, the film still has depth to it. I'd say a lot of the depth comes from the chemistry between Mario & Luigi as well as Mario's clear growing feelings for Peach. If you're going into this expecting it to be the next Godfather or LEGO Movie. Don't. Temper your expectations. This does not have an Oscar worthy plot. But that is a point for the film simply because most mainline Mario games had never been heavy on the plot.Next, we'll talk about the most controversial aspect. The casting. I'll start with Chris Pratt. As somebody who was vehemently defending him leading up to the film, I was genuinely surprised by his performance. His take on Mario is really really good. Keep in mind. This is NOT the Charles Martinet version of Mario. And it doesn't try to be. This is another version of Mario. Like Lou Albano or Walker Boone. And it works really well for the film. At worst, most people will view his performance as ""okay."" At best, most people will view his performance as ""really good."" But it is not bad. He is not dull in the slightest in the film. The trailers did not do him justice.Now the rest of the cast as short bullet points since I don't want the characters to be too bloated.Charlie Day as Luigi: He sounded really good. He was always perfect casting for Luigi and this movie really reaffirms that.Anya-Taylor Joy as Princess Peach: She sounded really good as well. A lot of people were concerned about how Peach being an action hero would take away from her soft and kindred personality. But that is absolutely still intact. It's just another side of her we've only ever seen in spin-offs.Jack Black as Bowser: Best cast member in the film. Sometimes he'll slip into sounding like Jack Black, but that does not affect his performance in the slightest. He still sounds incredible and is clearly eating this role up.Keegan-Michael Key as Toad: He sounded really good. The voice is definitely a Toad voice, but it works for a movie. Nobody is gonna wanna listen to the ear stabber that video game Toad is for an hour and half.Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek: As somebody who's known for doing really deep voices usually, this performance as Kamek is literally pitch perfect. What little dialogue he has is actually incredible and I couldn't think of a better voice for Kamek in this film.Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong: Seth Rogen is good in this film. I think his voice actually really suits Donkey Kong, but I do believe that some people will be put off by the fact that this is just Seth Rogen.Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong: If I had to choose a weak link in the cast, it is Fred Armisen. He's not bad, but he could be much better.Sebastian Maniscalco as Spike: He wasn't in the movie much, but his voice fits Spike really well for the take they go for in this film.All the supporting actors also do really well for what they're given and Charles Martinet's Cameos in the film are just beautiful and an exciting thing to hear.Objective Broad Conclusion: This film is really a fun family movie. Not everyone is gonna be as into this film as Mario fans will be. But this is still a rather fun time if you're not a Mario fan. 7/10Objective Mario Fan Conclusion: From a video game movie adaptation standpoint, this has set a standard for what they should be. This was a really really good film that is almost everything a Mario Movie should be. Some Mario fans will be put off by Chris Pratt. But at worst, his performance is passable. 8/10Subjective Personal Conclusion: This film is perfect in almost every sense of the word and is my all time favorite film. 10/10.","

"jviaes","9 April 2023","This movie was a lot of fun. My 9 year old and I loved it.The animation was superb, the story was very entertaining, and there were moments my mouth was open and I was leaning forward in awe. I may be hyping it up more than it actually is, but I want to have more movies like this.Starting with the animation, very detailed and carefully done. You could see the detail in the fabric of all the clothing, especially the shy guys. There's a sequence where they're traveling under the city of Brooklyn and the water was so realistic. I loved when they got to the ""Mario Kart"" portion because they did not skimp on the details.The story was excellent. They started Mario and Luigi off with humble beginnings and even included their family. There was an actual build up to the adventure which helped buy into the story. Though it did not stick necessarily to the traditional Princess Peach needing rescuing from Bowser, Mario was still his own hero and rose above the put downs being placed on him by Bowser and others. What gave me chills was at the end when Luigi helped Mario and they teamed up to beat Bowser. It was very heartfelt and epic.Though Princess Peach wasn't the traditional damsel in distress, it was evident none of this would have resolved without Mario. Princess Peach was still the apple of Mario's eye, but his brother was also very important to him.Lots of little Easter eggs (I think the Game Cube ring tone may have been my favorite).Two end credit scenes, but really hoping they do more that is at this level.","

"HardLight","16 April 2023","You get the slurry that is churned out of the literal conveyor belt that is Hollywood Studios these days and the latest variant of distilled rancid gutterleavings is this movie.Spoilers incoming because I need to have them.The only thing Illumination got right in this movie is the bright colours and character designs, everything else outside of that is dross. We start with an insult to the 80s cartoon and it only gets worse from there.Story makes no sense - why would Bowser keep people alive after capturing them? The only one he ever did was Princess Toadstool and that was for kidnap and ransom purposes. There's no point to Luigi and the variety of other characters being held in cages other than to do the issue this movie is full of.References.I don't go to a movie to say 'oh yeah, I know what that means' I go for a story and there isn't one here.Musical Numbers that of course would be in there because of course there's going to be, in a MARIO MOVIE. When was the last time you thought of Mario and singing? Never. But certain people are in this so of course there's going to be times where he just needs to break out into impromptu vocals that aren't needed.Like I said at the start the only thing this movie has going for it is the visuals as they're massively on-point, its bright, colourful and works with the idea of Mario games and is more than anything just an advert for all the various Mario related games at once and who needs an advert for a Mario game, the name recognition has more scope than the Pope these days.","

There's no humour. It was boring. Just chasing and fighting and not much fun.I don't know what else to say about it, but I've got to write more.

It was fun if you ignored the fact that the changed a lot of the elements that make Mario. Mario generally rescues Peach, not Luigi. Didn't follow any of the cannon story of Mario. Pratt is not the voice we love. Did they choose to state he was faking the voice all these years because Pratt couldn't do Mario the whole time? To loose a great voice actor over a subpar movie because you needed a name to drive up revenue was not the answer. It was just step for cheap lines. Jack Black was a welcome addition.","

In the process they are sucked into a warp and find themselves split apart and whisked off to a world where an evil tyrant named Bowser plans to conquer the world and kidnap the Princess. One brother, Luigi, is dropped on Bowsers doorstep and taken prisoner. The other brother, Mario, lands on the Princess' doorstep. The princess teaches Mario the ways of her world and he joins her in a mission to save the world and rescue his brother.This movie is codirected by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who collaborated on Teen Titans Go!, and contains the voices of Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy), Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch), Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Jack Black (School of Rock), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator) and Seth Rogen (Superbad).This movie is pure nostalgic gold and a tremendous depiction of the Mario Brothers Universe. There are so many of the legendary Mario brothers characters and villains in this and some subtle references to the old school NES universe. The dialogue is well written and there's some great lessons in here about friendship, family and giving people the benefit of the doubt. The animation is outstanding and the way the storyline unfolds is magic. Each character is perfectly depicted and this is another movie that as the events unfold you wish it would never end.Overall, this is a fun animated gem that the entire family will enjoy. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.","

"ChuckBristol","13 April 2023","Was assuming that I would just zone out and relax as my 13 and 10 year old grandsons took in the film. But, actually, I found it quite engaging with a clear narrative drive and clever nod towards the tropes of the Nintendo world (most of which I was only vaguely familiar with). We watched in 3D which was ok, giving the scenes some depth, but there were no 'coming out of the screen at you' moments which was a shame. The soundtrack is a bit lazy - really, you want to use 'Holding out for a hero' that's been used a million times before and 'Mr Blue Sky' (?!!) - but at least we got Beastie Boys, though you do feel they could've dug deeper for some less well used tracks. So decent entertainment for under 16s and, given atrocities like Trolls, I'm perplexed as to why the critics turned on this animation rather than some of the others.","

"cdjh-81125","5 April 2023","Overall it's just fine but I can hardly say I went into a film called; ""The Super Mario Bros Movie"" expecting anything other than a light, fun time and I think it's fair to say it gave that too me. The music choices really grated on my nerves after a while and the voice acting is definitely hit and miss, I also think the film could've benefited from being about 10/15 minutes longer since the story just feels so rushed through. But despite that the animation is gorgeous, the world is well realised, it's got a lot of entertaining sequences and I don't really think anyone is going to come out of this feeling like they didn't get what was sold to them. It's hardly the deepest or most ambitious animated movie I've seen but it'll definitely appeal to kids and I think I definitely would've loved it if I'd seen it at that age.","

"hectordanielbuelna","7 April 2023","I can't believe it. Nintendo made the same mistake once again. Mario games have always been kinda mediocre on the story department, but there've been a few good ones. One thing that never misses the mark is gameplay. Videogames are a very different media, but nintendo has been known for been very protective of their IPs. This makes it extremely frustrating to see this movie fails so horribly.I'm not joking when I say it feels like a remake of the old Mario movie. That one movie that made Nintendo abandon completely the movie industry. Sadly, they gave too much freedom to the creators of this film. A company known for pumping out mediocre films and disgusting amounts of sequels and spin off to their IPs.Even as a kids movie it fails at delivering, focusing more on pop culture and bostalgia instead of appealing to kids. And been a ""kids movie"" doesn't justify at all how awful this is.Nintendo coulda partnered with dreamworks, paramount or any other company, but no, they chose itumination. Probably the cheaper one.I feel so cheated.","

"rannynm","8 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the perfect video-game to movie adaptation! There's lots of laughs for all ages and loads of references to the Mario Games for all fans. I enjoy this animated movie because it gives the iconic characters we all know and love the movie adaptation that they all deserve.In this movie, we learn the origin story of our favorite video-game brothers, Mario and Luigi. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are just your average brothers living and working in Brooklyn as plumbers, but when they find a warp pipe in the sewer, they get transported to the magical land where Toads, Yoshi's and Koopa Troopas roam. Along the way, Luigi gets captured by the evil Bowser (Jack Black) and with the help of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Mario is forced to 'level up' and fight Bowser before he conquers the world.There's no need to play the video games to like this movie, but existing fans of the franchise will especially love it because of all the Easter eggs and familiar songs. This is such an imaginative story with characters and themes from some of my favorite games in the franchise - Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros. And Donkey Kong. I love how this has elements of the classic games but also new twists, like how Princess Peach in this movie isn't like your normal Princess Peach in need of rescuing, because she can save herself and is very skillful at doing so. I also love how relatable the brothers are as they are from our world. We've been seeing a lot of high quality animation from Illumination recently, and this movie follows the trend. The animation is cheerful and lively and the quality is top-notch. Jack Black, as Bowser, is absolutely perfect in this role. His versatile voice makes for an almost manic Bowser - scary, evil, quirky and laughable - and he can flip the two like a light switch. Chris Pratt as Mario and Charlie Day as Luigi have a lot of chemistry and seem like very close brothers. Collectively, they are relatable and help us sympathize with the plot even more.The messages of The Super Mario Bros. Movie are that family is the most powerful thing in the world (real and virtual) and when working together, you can accomplish anything.I give The Super Mario Bros. Movie 4 of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Players of any Mario games will enjoy this. It comes out in theaters April 5, 2023. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","

For fans of Mario you will find several instances of nostalgia and references from the game. If you just want to follow the script it does elicit a few laughs and is great fun to watch with family and kids. Overall a totally enjoyable experience with many characters from the game and adventures for Mario and Luigi to take on. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the movie with family. It is fun, entertaining and has a decent story line. Don't expect a Pixar or a Disney and this movie stands on it's own. Enjoy it and have fun.","

"paultenhout-140-413150","9 April 2023","The title says it all. And it's definetily not only made for kids. Plenty of laughs for Adults too. My favorites: Luma got me cracking with her terribly twisted mind and dirty Bowser is really, really obsessed with peaches.The story is a flat as you expect from a Mario movie, but that's ok. The runtime felt short, or better said: left me wanting for more. Nintendo just scratched the surface of what they could do with the Mario cinematic world.The visuals are stunning. I didn't have any expectations but it just feels like you can touch the fabric of the characters.The voices are fine. It felt natural, like it should, except for the ape king who really sounded too young for his age.Guaranteed a great family time. You will like it, especially if you know the super mario games.","

"The-Sarkologist","30 July 2023","Well, there was a movie from back in the 90s that attempted to bring the Mario Bros to the big screen, and basically failed. I remember loving that film, but looking back of it, and in light of this one, I sort of wonder why. Anyway, I couldn't help but compare the two films, though I have to say that I really didn't consider this one all that great. However, one thing I do have to mention is that they did go much further out of their way to link it with the game, including having Mario jump all over the place, and also the pipes that suck him through to other parts of the realm.Anyway, the story is about how this guy, Bowser, wants to marry the princess of Mushroom land. He has managed to get his hand on this power up, a star, and sends his island of lava in her direction. Meanwhile, the Mario Bros, two out of luck Brooklyn plumbers (Luigi is a bit of a clutz mind you) are trying to start out on their own, only to be sucked through a pipe into this land.The problem is that I'm actually not all that familiar with the world of Super Mario Bros. Well, okay, I do know that Donkey Kong and Mario do exist in the same world (and I believe that the classic arcade game Donkey Kong was actually the first Mario Bros game, and they certainly do pay homage to these old games). I guess that is one thing that the previous film didn't do, and that is bring Donkey Kong into the picture.One thing that I found interesting was that they eventually landed up in Brooklyn, which I don't know if it ever happens in the games, but then again I'm not really all that familiar with the games so I honestly cannot say whether this is the case or not. Anyway, as for the film, I personally can't really say that it is one of those films that I would consider the greatest. Actually, I sort of considered to be, well, somewhat dull. However, I know my brother enjoyed it, so I guess that is what counts.","

"mspiggi","15 April 2023","I am obviously the minority for this movie.So, hear me out or pfft the whole review.Jack Black is the only actor in this line up suited and talented for this style character work.Peaches has by far the worst voice characterization and felt like the casting director's criteria was blonde hairDonkey kong is Seth Rogen-as Seth RogenAnimation beautiful and colorfulMovement through the story line and scenes was awkward, dialogue cliche and boring2 different occasion Bowser uses pain as a means to intimidate1st scene pulling mustache hair while Luigi yells oww and to stopSecond slams hands in piano and says pain is the best teacher. For sure bad guy stuff, but really does nothing for the plot and for a kids film, based on a beloved video game?Just an obvious bad taste for a kids movie.Voice actors was the most confusing part in the end. It's a kids movie so really plot thickening is not their strong suit, but this felt like the original cast got strep and someone had some famous friends who could step in
When really, if the whole movie was dubbed over by Jack Black it would be worth a watch again.","

"Cin_E_File","1 September 2023","This is the most generic, predictable, bland movie I've seen. It has the most simplest and AI done story. Basically, the loser is a protagonist, but is no longer a loser by accomplishing something. That is the most basic done so many times before story I've seen. The models are fine, but the characters move in a generic, basic, so good it's bad way. The music although decent, is just basically a not-so special AI orchestral cover with random themes shoved in, and inappropriate use of licensed songs. The good qualities are the Peaches song and Charlie Day as Luigi. Barbie is the complete opposite of this movie. It does have a story with actual good humor, great acting, and likable characters.","

"wolfen-14012","10 April 2023","I know, it's probably too much to expect a Mario movie to be anything more than okay at best, but I was still disappointed in it.Taking inspiration from the 90s Mario movie and having Mario come from another world was not a good idea. It's lazy writing which requires very minimal effort to fit the protagonists into the story. It's an overdone trope and this movie did nothing to make it interesting. The story as a whole would be a lot better and more engaging if they didn't have this element at all. Just because Mario, Luigi, and Peach are not Toads, it doesn't mean they have to be from another dimension.The story was also very rushed. I get that it's a cartoon, but you can at least try to have slightly realistic interactions between the characters. They just say a few words and then they become best friends.Peach is my next complaint. I'm getting rather tired of the ""perfect"" woman trope. Peach has zero flaws and is better at everyone at everything. She has zero personality besides being awesome at everything. This is also bad writing.Bowser wasn't too much better. They try to add in a few lines in the final conflict about how he has apparently been suffering his whole life and his only way to be happy was to be with Peach, but there was nothing beforehand to expound on this. His only motivation is just that he is going to marry the princess and blow up the Mushroom Kingdom. It wouldn't have taken that much work or screen time to fix this problem.I guess every character is pretty one-dimensional, now that I'm thinking about it.The whole point of this movie was the have a barely coherent story, just enough to hold together an endless slew of Mario game references. It really was a constant barrage of ""Hey, look at this thing you recognize!"" Some people might have been gushing over it all, but that isn't enough to make it a good movie for me. Actually, I find it more annoying than anything else.I am also very confused about the choice in soundtrack. The cinema score versions of Mario theme songs was understandable, if poorly executed, but why the 80s songs? It didn't fit the movie at all.In terms of the voice acting, I didn't mind any of it except for Seth Rogan as DK, but that's just because I don't like Seth Rogan. I don't care if Mario doesn't have an Italian accent. If he actually talked like Mario did in the games, it would get annoying really fast. Plus, it's an American movie, so American accents are to be expected.Am I being too critical about a kids movie adaptation of a videogame series for kids? Maybe. But I enjoyed the Mario games well enough and would have liked a respectful movie adaptation instead of this formulaic nostalgia bate.","

"hadjiquest79","26 April 2023","I grew up on Nintendo and understood the Easter eggs throughout the entire film. If you kids of the '80s grew up on Nintendo, then you gotta check this movie out. I even got to meet Charles Martinet, back in 2018 at a video game expo. This is nothing like the 1993 Super Mario Bros. Movie, which was released by Disney under the Hollywood Pictures banner. This movie was released by Universal Pictures in partnership with Nintendo. What's even better is that you got a star-studded voice cast. Jack Black did a good job voicing King Koopa. Keegan Michael Key as Toad, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi and Chris Pratt as Mario.","

"JohnDeSando","17 April 2023","""Mamma Mia."" Mario (voice of Chris Pratt)That is the best line I could come up with, or at least the one so often used as to be memorable from The Mario Super Bros. Movie. It also points out the lack of good lines about Italians in Brooklyn because writer Matthew Fogel uses it so much. Yep, I'm disappointed this animation, ballyhooed by way of Nintendo's smash-game franchise, is not more creative or more quiet or more human centered.Humanitarian as opposed to punches and blasts, punctuated by the oldest possible cliches with characters thrown around and barely smudged. Too much pushing around and not enough original verbal combat.The titular brother plumbers enter the bowels of the earth through the sewers to save Brooklyn from flooding. Along the way they are thrust into the Mushroom Kingdom with the usual suspects of bad guys and a beauteous princess, this time a real peach, Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), after saving her from marrying Illumination Studios' version of a bad beast, Bowser (Jack Black), leader of the Koopas, who intends to take over the Mushroom Kingdom.Besides the rampant formulaic story line, directors Aaron Horvath et al. Concentrate on the common theme of sticking together to survive. But then that is nothing new on all genre fronts.The Mario Bros. Movie is generic kids' stuff, so fast as to keep the hyper crowd calm and adults wondering how this loudly-colored animation brimming with cliches and barely memorable lines could have set the record for opening animations and yet not even come close in quality to its own franchise classics such as Despicable Me, Sing, or Minions.Could be we have forgotten Toy Story's greatness, or there's nothing out there at this dry season after Oscar. So much Italian good humor missed for the sake of loud noises and explosions. Not a classic but entertaining enough for kids at a low time for movies.","

I watched it, piece by piece, and I think this was a great movie. The story is basically about The Mario Brothers, Mario and Luigi, that get sucked into a different univers and of course, they have to stop Bowser before he take over the world. Here are the good and the bad sides of the movie:
Of course, this is a family-friendly movie, so it was a lot of childish humor that I didn't like so much. But I do not mean it is bad, either, it is just not my style of humor. From the good sides, it is a nice, simple story that kids will understand, also great animation, it looked not like a normal Illumination animation definitely. It was way better. Most of the voice-actors where great, like Chris Pratt (As Mario) and Bowser (Jack Black). They had the perfect voice and I couldn't imagine someone else to play their role. The conclusion is: If you have kids in your family, go and watch that movie, or if you are a big Mario-fan, you should watch it as well. My final rating is 8/10 (Very Good).","

"FeastMode","5 April 2023","Yes. Yes. Yes.Thank you.We as a fanbase have suffered for so long with terrible video game movies. We gained some hope with the pretty awesome Sonic movies. But The Super Mario Bros. Movie feels like an arrival. I love this movie.As an adult, the only PG animated movies I usually go for are the funny ones. My favorites are most of the movies from these franchises: Despicable Me, Lego/Batman, and The Incredibles. What do they have in common? Beautiful visuals, cool action and they're hilarious, even for adults.The Super Mario Bros. Movie fits right in with these series. I was laughing throughout. A few scenes had me cracking up to the point I thought I was being too loud. The visuals look great and so accurate to the game, exactly how I would want them to look. And the action scenes all had me smiling.But how good of an adaptation is it? I've played 30+ Mario games going all the way back to the NES when I was a kid. And I was ecstatic at the amount of things I noticed from various games throughout the franchise's history. I recognized so many items, characters, musical cues, sound effects, etc. The story doesn't seem to follow a specific game. But it's exactly something I would expect to see in a Mario chapter, with various ideas pulled from different games.They absolutely knocked it out of the park with the casting across the board. So many of the choices feel 100% perfect. Like, of course they chose him, who else would it be?I had such a fun time with this movie. If you like the movies I mentioned above, I think you will too, even if you're not a Mario fan. Although the Mario fans are in for a treat.I can't help but feel joy. Please let this be a turning point for video game movies. The possibilities are endless.P. S. I said this in a group chat before the movie: ""I'm so nervous about the Mario movie. You realize the success of this movie could hugely impact possibilities for future Metroid and Zelda movies.""Hopefully it makes enough money because this NEEDS to happen. Of course I would prefer a much more serious and darker take, preferably live-action with a talented writer and director.

"pete-murphy97","7 April 2023","This is purely a fan servicing checklist of fan expectations, it's a project that wants to tap into the huge popularity of the Super Mario Bros franchise without a clear plan of how to port the videogame into a fully-fledged movie. In fact, granted, it's a difficult task to undertake, and this attempt hasn't hit the mark exactly - although clearly some fun has been has along the way. So, why is it hard to get Mario on the big screen? Super Mario Bros was/is mainly a sidescroller, dialogue is sparse, it has a limited range of NPC characters, and the previous film in the nineties completely flopped, as an indication that thirty years later a reattempt (probably) shouldn't be made. Not to mention I, and I'm sure many others, have always viewed the plumbing duo as abstract characters in an abstract world, originally seen through a small screen on a retro device, not the biggest screen possible for a retail audience. That being said, I think people love Mario too much to care about this being ""good,"" many people just want to consume Mario content in as many forms of media as possible.However, making the titular brothers human removes them from their near mutism and occasional ""wahoos,"" as seen in the videogames. They were characters rooted in an idiosyncratically oddball platforming world with a simple, objective-based plotline to prop things up. This movie reverses that - taking them away from the linear platforming and attempting to cobble together a forgettable plot for the sake of cinema profit.There's a decent range of Nintendo universe characters in the mix, but they don't do much besides make their (often brief) appearances to service the fans. Even Luigi doesn't do much, spending much of the film out of the limelight; possibly the film's biggest blunder. The film frantically flicks through a catalogue of nostalgic references in its allotted runtime. Princess Peach seems lonely her kingdom of toad citizens, lending to her unconvincing origin story. This is but one of the many ways the videogame poorly translates to the big screen.As a kids film this works, as a family movie (inclusive of adults), it doesn't work. There isn't multilayered comedic nuance, as seen in Shrek (2001), and there isn't a memorable plotline. It's just 80-minute runtime of a Mario promo for the next generation.6.1/10.","

"rogerdragon","10 April 2023","It's just gorgeous , the plot is really good , it gives out many references to the game and it's pretty nostalgic , the visual stimuli is pretty good , so watching it in 3D like I did is definitely recommend, I found it hilarious at times and I had such a great time with my friends in the theater , the graphics are perfect and the voice actors did an amazing job , it's also pretty well-paced , and the characters are all really funny and interesting , if you are an adult who wants to live some nostalgia or if you got a kid , you'd definitely have to give it a try , you won't be wasting your time .","

"mike_big_mac","2 May 2023","This movie is absolutely awful. The storyline sucks. Wait. What storyline? The whole movie is just awful. This is honestly right down there with sausage party. I can't believe that anyone would pay to see this movie. The only cool hidden nostalgia/Easter eggs is the little rid bits of music and sound effects hidden within the movie. If you're not paying attention, you'd miss it. But then again, there is nothing worth paying attention to in this movie so you probably won't miss the cool music (at times). This. Movie. Is. Just. Plain. Awful. It's not even worth streaming anywhere for free. Don't waste your time.","

I came in expecting the worst.I could not stop smiling and laughing the whooole way through!The writing is great, jokes are on point, the animation is fantastic, art direction is great! Voice acting is superb. Every character is really done well.Bowser is actually scary and crazy. Hats off to everyone who took part in this film.The music is fantastic! You recognise each song and it's done in a modern way. All the sound design. From mysterybox popping, to jumping onto ennemies. The attention to detail between games and the film is unique.People who rate films 1/10 do not deserve to watch them.The amount of work that is put in in each little bit, be respectful please.","

"freeak76","24 December 2023","It was bright, colorful and beautiful, just like the games, exactly how you would expect a Mario movie to be. But there was just something about it that had me bored the entire time.Staring at Mario and the whole crew my entire life has just left me bored with it all I guess?Or perhaps it because I'm not a 10 year old kid anymore?It just all fell flat for me. It was extremely fast paced and super predictable, they tried to cram a lot into it in a short time.The one and only thing that I actually liked about it was Jack Black voicing Bowser.I've read that there is already a sequel in the works (of course there is, ugh...) so hopefully that will be better than this one.","

"alandavidmckenzie","21 October 2023","As a Mario fan from the age of 4, having played virtually every game, I thought maybe my expectations were perhaps too high. But upon further reflection, it is clear that Hollywood just keeps setting the bar lower and lower.It's a crying shame that the story is soo hollow and bland. Soo much of this movie was done right. The cinematics, the texture mapping, the lighting, the sounds. This could have been a real gem if not for the script writing and voice actor selections.Nintendo loves to stick with what works and they're very resistant to change. It's quite surprising that they would veer soo far off course with the voice actors given what we're all accustomed to. The only person I thought represented the character well was Jack Black.What baffles me is how this was the final product given the 40 years of material they had to work with. In some respects The Angry Birds Movie was a better execution, and they had barely any back story to work with.At the end of the day, Nintendo played it safe, and as a brand that used to be known for taking chances (Wii controllers, dual screen consoles, and even Virtual Boy), it's really sad to see them produce such a mediocre product.I have faith in their abilities to continue making fantastic games with memories that will last a lifetime. I would suggest if this is their best attempt to bring their games to the big screen, perhaps they should rethink that avenue.","

"kelboy10","28 April 2023","The super Mario Brothers is a film aimed at kids or anybody who still has the nostalgia for the video games they played around the 90s. What I found particularly good within the realms of this movie was how visually stunning it was combined with it playing homage to the games in a variety of scenes emulating the typical Mario old school camera angles. With a bit of Donkey Kong alongside some Super Mario Kart action this hit home on all accounts in trying to bring to life all things Mario on the big screen! Admittedly I don't think this type of movie will have the same impact once it becomes available on some of the streaming apps. The stand out moment for me was the battle Mario would have to encounter in order to get the help of the kings army, the encounter with none other than Donkey Kong.The story is pretty basic, still, considering this is video game material, who'd really expect something with layers upon layers of depth? No pun intended this one does ""exactly what it says on the tin"" and it succeeds in focusing on what it is, rather than trying to be something it isn't. Another memorable moment to accompany the battle was early on for me, I was somewhat flabbergast by the level of detail in the sewer and the rain splashing away reflections that looked ultra real taking computer graphics up a notch in my book. The brothers start out as plumbers wanting to get their name out to the world and not be seen as a joke; all they want is to be taken seriously. The pacing is fast as we are soon bolted into an entirely different world below Brooklyn down through...Of course a tube, then millions of green tubes. Just like the game right? The world us gamers will be familiar with within the Nintendo that sees talking mushrooms, power ups and of course endless attempts to complete an obstacle course.The main obstacle though for this animated feature length to hit the heights of say a 'Toy Story' or a 'Wreck It Ralph' is the lack of sophistication required to keep the older adult member engaged. At its core it's very simplistic, not allowing itself to expand to the wit or humour others have prior to it, without the adult humour jokes, it must solely focus on creating relatable emotion or empathy that everybody can relate to. Despicable me, had a character that was appealing to the older audience whilst catering to the younger with his cute minion amongst minions. This isn't a major problem as I think it's target audience consisting of kids will respond with joy. So success, success, we've done it! We've done it! But to take it a little further into acclaimed animated feature length history, to finish the race in first place on the podium, it really did need just a little more! The story of Princess Peach no longer being the damsel in distress seemed fitting.The voice actors all appeared to do a good job for me as well as the direction and classic retro Mario video game tune. The singing of (Jack Blacks) Bowser felt more than a little out of place to me, maybe Jack just fancied a little sing song again. As long as we're together.","

"Horst_In_Translation","18 May 2023","""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a co-production between Japan and the United States from 2023, so this is a really new movie and the Japanese component stems of course from the Nintendo background as this company is even one of the producers here, which you don't see too often with movies, not even animated movies, but it is pretty much a given here as this is all about Mario, one of the most famous video game characters of all time. But before I get to the story and characters, I wanna say that it is also a good thing because after all Nintendo created him and his wonderful worlds back in the day. In the end, the language is not important anyway, as you can watch it in your native language simply as you don't see actors then having different voices than their own. At minimally over 1.5 hours this is not a long film at all and I say that completely without judgment as I feel it is not crucial how long a film is if we connect it to the question if a film is worth seeing and good or even great. Here the running time felt okay I would say. There are three directors here and just one writer, which is something you don't see too often. Two of the directors come from the ""Teen Titans Go!"" franchise and have collaborated there already and that would be Horvath and Jelenic, who are both from California, even if their names don't sound like it. The third is Pierre Leduc, who interestingly enough started his career with Mickey Mouse almost 30 years ago and then rose to fame mostly thanks to all the Despicable Me films and spin-offs. This is where Illumination as a production company also comes into play. Same is true for Matthew Fogel, who launched his career with a Martin Lawrence drag comedy, then went on to Lego before he finally worked on a Minions movie and now he is with Mario. Quite a journey. Especially the jump from said drag movie to Lego after a break of almost ten years seems extraordinary.If we look at the voice actors, the American ones, it is roughly who you would expect. I mean it's literally people who could also play these characters in a live action scenario I suppose. Chris Pratt I started disliking quickly after Parks and Rec, so not too big on this choice. He is so overexposed. Anya Taylor-Joy is still kinda alright, but I had other problems with her character here. Charlie Day, well ""Always Sunny"" never really did a lot for me if I'm honest and he may have been a key reason. Jack Black I cannot really say too much negative about, he is okay and finally Seth Rogen I don't like a lot either, but him voicing Donkey Kong is maybe the most obvious choice here. Keagan-Michael Key for Toadstool? Interesting. No judgment there. The minor character, even the protagonists' parents, got voiced be actors that are totally unknown really and many of them have Italian(-American) backgrounds, which is definitely not a coincidence. But overall I am not too big on the voice cast here as you have understood already now I guess and this was also one reason why I decided to go for the German dub. There the actors were alright. One of the better aspects and the film's problems and also biggest strengths were elsewhere. One strength for me is the retro background. Mario is literally my youth in terms of video games and I am sure this is true for millions, if not billions of other video game fans and people who watched this film. I mean it even reached the top spot on the imdb popularity meter, so this shows I am not the only one. The overall rating for this film is fairly solid, but critics did not like it a lot, so it probably will not make an impact come awards season 2023/2024. The release date is maybe not helping a lot either. But they probably wanted to get it out still before summer when people don't really go to the movies that much anymore. Well, people except me I should say. But that is another story.I will just talk about what I liked most about this movie. Of course, the biggest thing is seeing all these beloved characters. It helps so much if you know them and I myself was always more of a Luigi guy than a Mario guy, but both are cool. You can add Toad, Donkey Kong, Bowser, the Koopas, but also the smaller characters like Bowser's closest assistant there who had magical abilities with which he could rule himself basically or also those ghosts, like the one really big one at the wedding or Donkey Kong's father (who I thought was his grandpa in the game or uncle, but anyway). With the latter, even if he was not a crucial character, I was still baffled that he was part of this movie (I almost wrote ""game"") as his connection with Mario is literally not existent and the Donkey Kong version as the protagonist of his own games and not merely the antagonist from the very old video games was something I did not expect, but it was a pleasant surprise. I could go on and on about many other characters, but I will leave it at that. Another brief inclusion I quite liked was the idea of the challenge the princess had for Mario as it simply included a lot from the video games or that skeleton turtle that Luigi runs into and thinks he defeated it was cool too because I remember myself how annoying it was when they were just a pile of bones, but got resurrected right away. I wish they could have kept going with these direct references to the video game(s) until the very end. But sadly, they did not. There is some Mario Kart racing included here, which is also cool and loved the game so much, but this was already something were I felt this could have been handled better and in a more nostalgic fashion, but it was no such thing sadly. It all went a bit downhill from there and felt written and directed in a way to mostly please and satisfy those who are not too familiar with the video games. The references get fewer and fewer as the film goes on and approaches the end. Pity. I was willing to give it a 4/5 or 8/10 after the first 40 minutes still, but eventually I just can't and I say this is a good film, but not a great one and at the same time a missed opportunity.Another problem I personally had with this movie was the inclusion of Princess Peach. Of course, she had to be in the film, but she is almost a co-lead and that is way too much. She even jumps around like a massive heroine when the truth is she was not once a playable character in the games. As far as I know. So why was she so defining in here? I assume the filmmakers were scared maybe that people would criticize them for not coming up with any powerful female characters? I think it's pathetic. She is literally hardly in the games at all and all we know about her is that Bowser abducted her or so if we find out anything. In a way, there is a parallel here too, but Bowser wants to marry her. He is also pretty jealous, but luckily they kept the love story between her and Mario short or basically non-existent. Only Toad thinks there may be something. But yeah, we even find out about the princess' youth and how she ended up there with the toads. This was not needed. The wise Toad was still cool. Also not needed was the story about Donkey Kong and especially Mario's lack of approval from their fathers. Which in a way turned them into friends. They tried to go for depth when all they should have done was go for a gigantic fun movie. I enjoyed the three seconds much more when we see Donkey Kong lie in his hammock and eat a banana than any of this emotional pseudo depth that was done away with in the end within seconds when Mario's father watches his son deal with Bowser. Interesting reference, however, that turtles are not one but evil in our world. In fact, they are among the most awesome creatures out there I dare say. From my perspective at least. So here and there, there is stuff to enjoy again and most of it was linked to the question what I remember the most from the video games.That slightly strange creature with an emo touch that was also Bowser's prisoner in a cage did not do too much for me, so it felt a bit off that they brought it back for the closing credits too to show us its saxophone talent for whatever reason. But yeah, other than that the music was great. The best aspects were the tunes that came directly from the video games. The songs used otherwise were really nice too and truly famous, even if I am not sure if they fit the film that well. I'd say that they maybe didn't. Take the Bonnie Tyler song for example. I mean it's a great number, but in the context it was included, I would give it a nay, even if it was not so bad that I had to laugh like others in the audience did when it came to another song choice. But well, it is Illumination and I am also not a huge fan of the Minions films (I prefer the ""Despicable Me"" movies), so it makes sense they took the wrong route there. I also would have done without the Minions depiction in the opening of the film because come on, leave them out, this is all about Mario, even if you try to make a clumsy connection with Minion Kart or whatever that was. The scene where Mario showed us his superpowers and what happens when he consumes mushrooms and is able to fly could also have been handled better. It was mostly the moment when he had to go up against Donkey Kong and beat him, so that the army of apes would fight with them. I was not won over by this either. In the end, the film was really nice early on, but eventually leaves a lot to be desired. Scenes like Bowser playing the piano were simply not funny and did not have connections to the games, so they should have ditched them. Stuff like Donkey Kong throwing a barrel after Mario on one occasion cut the cake so much more and they did not even have to invent this from scratch. Which means that where they invented, the film did not go right. I still hope there will be a sequel and that it will be better. There's still a lot to offer that has not been included here like Wario, Fire Flowers and Yoshi. Cautious thumbs-up for this first film.","

"HotHamlet","2 August 2023","The much-anticipated Super Mario Bros Movie is a delightful and enjoyable film that despite its shortcomings, is a fun little experience for all ages.On a visual level the film is a vibrant, colourful and energetic spectacle. The world of the Mushroom Kingdom is brought to life in a way that pays homage to the original games while also adding a modern twist. The character designs are faithful to their video game counterparts, and the attention to detail is truly commendable. The film is also has a great load of visual references and easter eggs that will surely delight dedicated fans. The little visual secrets you see on screen are really enjoyable and fun if you have ever played a Mario mainline game.The audio references in the movie are also rather fun. The original music from the video games is woven into the film's score. Each familiar tune is given a cinematic change. However if you listen closely you can hear the original scores in there which I really like. The soundtrack overall in this movie however isn't as good as I'm making it seem. This is because despite the fact there are many original tunes in the movie, there are many hit songs that are played throughout some action scenes that I feel don't need to be there. For movie all about Super Mario and co. I would have preferred they used stuff already established in Mario games and original songs. There are some of this and although Bonnie Tyler doesn't ruin the movie, it kinda takes you out of the moment at hand and doesn't feel very fitting for this Mario movie.It is a very good family film. The humor is light-hearted and fun, with plenty of slapstick moments that will make both children happy. The story (while simple) is engaging and filled with positive messages about teamwork, bravery and friendship. The characters, from the heroic Mario and Luigi to the villainous Bowser, are all well respected from the source material. This is a huge positive as not only lifelong fans but also children still playing the games to this day will recognise everything in the movie. A very good watch for anyone of any age looking for a quick fun movie.Despite its many strengths, the film is not without its flaws. As a movie carrying the Super Mario Bros name, there's a level of expectation attached to it. While the film does a good job of honoring its source material, some may feel that it doesn't fully capture the magic of the games. By this I mean you will not leave feeling fully satisfied as a Mario lover I do believe. Now that being said I am no longer a child and am not a mega fan of Mario. However I did play many of the games as a kid and always felt that something was missing whilst watching the movie. The final few scenes in particular were a letdown. The climax felt rushed and the resolution seemed poor. The film seemed to lose its momentum towards the end, leaving a somewhat poor taste after an otherwise nice ride. I also disliked Seth Rogan voice acting Donkey Kong as you can only hear him in the apes voice and although the voice does fit to a certain extent, if you know who the voice is it cannot be unheard. Every other voice actor did well and although I knew most of the main casts voice actors, I didn't (unlike Rogan) hear their voice throughout. They all sounded like they belonged. I can understand for younger audiences however they would not mind Seth at all voicing Donkey Kong.I think the overall story is solid. It wasn't quite as good as movies of a similar elk for me such as the recent Sonic The Hedgehog movies. But it was easily enough to pad out the runtime. The CGI was brilliantly done for a completely animated feature. Nothing felt poorly animated and I never wished for more in this department. They did a great job of making the Human characters look like they belong in the Mario franchise and not uncanny at all. The animation and visual effects was extremely good and a huge positive for the film.Overall, the movie is a fun journey through one of gaming's most beloved franchises. It's a film that will surely delight any fan of the Mario games, young or old. Despite its flaws, it's a movie that I would recommend to anyone who's a fan of Super Mario or anyone who enjoys a good, family-friendly adventure.7/10.","

"neil-476","17 April 2023","Brooklyn plumber brothers Mario and Luigi are just about to get stuck in to what appears to be a broken water main when they find themselves whisked off to a realm where a) the laws of physics are no more than an amusing notion, and b) thuggish moster ape/turtle/lizard thingie Bowser is about to invade the idyllic mushroom real of Pricess Peach in order to get her to marry him. Mario has to try to recruit the Donkey Kong army to help while searching for Luigi.My poor hand/ete coordination meant that I mostly just watched my kids playing computer games, but my recollections suggest that this film, while having its own story, is pretty faithful to the orginal naterial in terms of looks and feel, and that is surely a large part of its raison d' etre - let's bring in the 40-year olds who played through the various Mario Bros games, and let-'s load the movie up with nostalgia. And that's exactly what they've done.But this is generated by Chris Meladandri's Illuminations (the company behind the Minions) so they know how to be funny, well-crafter, thoughtful, colourful, action-packed, just enough drama and jeopardy, and with a good helping of heart. And this is all those things, too.The voice casr is stellar and on good form. The visuals are faithful to the games, cinema standard, wonderfully animated, and well worth seeing in 3DAll in all - Wahoo!","

"T-ZER0","9 April 2023","I'm convinced that these directors have never played a Mario game. There are inconsistencies in this movie that I will go over a bit here, but if you would like more detail, I will make sure to include it in a YouTube video.Firstly, they got the most crucial plot element wrong. Peach is the one that is supposed to be kidnapped! Not Luigi! One could argue that they are trying to flesh out Peach's character, but why is this movie called Super Mario Bros when the bros are not even together 80% of the movie!Whose idea was it to cast Chris Pratt as Mario and Charlie Day as Luigi? They sound nothing like the video games and every time they spoke I wanted to facepalm. It's so off it's not funny. Why does an ice flower freeze Bowser when it doesn't not affect him or any of the other Koopas on the video game?? Seriously, get out your 3DS, Switch, Wii U or whatever and try to freeze Bowser during a boss battle on the game. IT DOES NOTHING!!!Why is the origin of these two off? Remember in the original game, Cranky, the original DK kidnapped Pauline and Mario (Jumpman) had to save her? Yeah, that didn't happen. Also, when Donkey Kong first appeared, why did they play the DK Rap? They could have played the Donkey Kong Country SNES title theme remastered! Then I would have cheered.Bowser singing on the piano was cringeworthy, and I don't care how much you want to make it epic, an invincibility star only lasts 13 seconds tops, not two minutes. Oh, and those surprise cameos from Charles Martinet. He plays a character who looks like the original Mario. It just reminds me of Uncharted on how they got the original actor just to waste them in a cameo.I can't wait till they make a sequel and cast Kaitlin Olson as Daisy, Jordan Peele as Toadsworth and Brie Larson as Rosalina. It'll be epic it tell you!!","

"rohanumpleby-34057","31 July 2023","I like the artsy look on the film. It's certainly is a well polished film. And the fact it stays true to the source material is great too. The Characters are all charming and likeable, with the otherwise solid but nowhere near perfect movie. And don't let the massive talent fall you, it's an average movie. That I'm sure your kids will enjoy, you as an adult will be moderately entertained from time-to-time but that's about it.However talking about the flauesent design and look of the film. The Soundtrack is also superb. I was shocked! And its also good because they use the song and the theme tune from the original cartoons. The colours all make it a pleasant watch. With some great ideas inside the film just like the soundtrack. A-HA theme tune plays too, and that's a feel good banger. That song gives some much needed elevation in the story.Some more good ideas is how they played the scenes that were mostly in the trailers, in the start of the movie. So we Don't get a predictable final sequence which is great. I like how they split Mario and Luigi into different worlds. One the dark zone. With a great starting action-sequence that will put you on the edge of your seat. However Mario is on a nice world. Where nothing bad will happen. I liked the onscreen chemistry the cast had. And the ability to make me laugh as much as I did. Some Hillarious scenes. Great Action Sequences too. The fight between The Monkey and Mario had me laughing so hard! It was so funny how he could smash Mario. And the determination that Mario had was perfect, as he showed real strength and courage.However all those positives being said, I think the film was far too loud it became a tad overbearing by the end. I had it on the lowest volume possible, and it was still a racket. The Movie needed to be smoother with the sound. Because it's all well and good having a story, and nice effects with a likeable cast but you need to also find the right balance of sound. I think as short as the movie was, I feel like they should of dwelled more with the Character arcs, because there is wayyy to many jokes in this film. And the characters whilst are likeable, don't have much personality. Another thing is, it's overstuffed. There's too much going on, all inside a 1hr 36 minute film. They could have slowed down and had a Pause ⏸, there that's better! Instead it was way to quick. Point is the characters or atleast some are one note. My verdict.Verdict,6.5/10 Better pacing, quiter sound that would of meshed better with the movie would of worked better, overall a solid movie though.","

"movieman6-413-929510","9 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a new animated film adaptation of the famous Super Mario video games. The film is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who co-created the animated TV series Teen Titans Go! Have worked.The plumber brothers Mario (voice of Chris Pratt) and Luigi (voice of Charlie Day) end up separated from each other in the Mushroom Kingdom from Brooklyn. Here, Mario must help Princess Peach (voice of Anya Taylor-Joy) in her fight against Bowser (voice of Jack Black), who has captured Luigi.Since the first live-action film adaptation of the popular Nintendo video game characters, which was not so well received, Nintendo has left behind further official film adaptations of their characters. After the success of filming other video games such as the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, Nintendo is now trying again in an attempt to successfully film their video game characters as well.Together with film studios Universal Pictures and the Illumination animation film, they have now made a good film adaptation of the popular video game characters. They have nicely filled the film with recognizable references to elements from the video games such as well-known characters, environments and sounds from the games. Both older and younger viewers can recognize many of these things. The recognizable images are now only in the style of how other Illumination animation films look like the Minions films. Composer Brian Tyler also further filled the film with a fitting soundtrack filled with tunes from the video games.The story has also remained a bit on the simple side, so it is not special for older viewers. The film is a bit more fun for younger viewers, who are also familiar with the Nintendo video game characters. However, there are a few dark moments in the film, which can be a bit scary for young children.Apart from some self-mockery and further comedy by playfully using things from the Nintendo game world, the film itself is not as comical as it could have been. Most comedy is still more intended for younger viewers.The voice acting is voiced by the film cast in appropriate ways, but unfortunately most of them do little special with their roles. The fact that the Italian Mario and Luigi are voiced by American actors more in a New York style did not go down well with fans at first, who are used to hearing Italian accents with the characters. Fortunately, Chris Pratt and Charlie Day know how to make the voices of the characters their own. Who has put a lot of time and energy into his voice acting is Jack Black. He knows how to give Bowser a suitable deep voice, but also knows how to play with the voice nicely. So much so that he manages to fit a song into the film.","

"kilmurrymatthew","8 July 2023","Let me say that this film isn't a masterpiece or a cinematic achievement in filmmaking, but aside from this, its great. If you are looking for a fun film to switch off your brain and enjoy it with your kids and family, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a good idea and a must watchThe story of the movie is quite basic, just like the games. Nothing more, nothing less. The vouce acting is better than I expected, Jack Black is phonomenal as his given role as Bowser.The movie is quite fast-paced though, it sometimes moves from scene to scene quite quickly and dosen't give the popcorn-munching audience lots of time to breathe. I prefer this over the Sonic movies, but the Sonic films have better pacing. Aside from the voice acting and giving the characters personalities, the film could have had slightly better character development.","

"kosmasp","22 May 2023","No pun intended - and I know that this does rub some people the wrong way. Especially the people who are big fans of the 90s movie - with John Leguizamo ... the actor being one of the biggest fans and defenders. His co-star from that movie felt differently all along. But whether you're with John or Bob (Hoskins), try to be open minded ... like the open world this sort of plays in. Or open universe ... and judging by the impact this made at the box office, I'd say most were able to enjoy this.Good for everyone that was able to - me included I reckon. And yes if you really want to, you can rip this to pieces. Something you can do with almost everything of course. But if you dive into the world it created ... well it is made with love. And yes ""it is me a mario"" ... may not fly as well as it did back in the day ... but it also didn't matter that the main character was not Italian for this movie ... and let's be real: neither was John or Bob from the original movie (or whatever you want to call it).The animation is good, the jokes work and for fans of the game(s): you'll have a lot to cheer for. During the movie and after it (mid credit and after credit scenes). The voice work is also good - I may not have the biggest knowledge when it comes to the games, but I do know certain things. Which I reckon is true for most who watched this in cinemas ... the makers seem to knew how to tap into that. And the in jokes work ... again you can be snarky about it, but why not just sit back and enjoy the madness ... it is more fun! No pun intended here either ...","

"stevendbeard","9 April 2023","I saw The Super Mario Bros. Movie, starring the voices of Chris Pratt-the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, The Magnificent Seven_2016; Charlie Day-Fist Fight, the Horrible Bosses movies; Anya Taylor_Joy-Peaky Blinders_tv, The Witch and Jack Black-Jumanji: The Next Level, Tropic Thunder.This is a movie based on a video game and as I have mentioned before, I didn't play a lot of them growing up-I know about some of them but I just didn't play them. There has been some talk about the casting-Chris as Mario in particular because he is not Italian-but I can only tell you about my experience. Chris/Mario and Charlie/Luigi are brothers that work as plumbers in Brooklyn. After a freak accident, Chris & Charlie get sucked into a Mushroom Kingdom where they discover Anya/Princess Peaches is in battle with Jack/Bowser, who wants to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom and marry Anya as an afterthought. Chris and Charlie join the fight and there are lots of Easter Eggs for all the fans of the original games-at least that's what I've heard, including eating certain mushrooms that will give a person extra power, car races on Rainbow bridges, Donkey Kong and I'm sure a lot others that I don't even know about. There is a scene just as the end credits start and another one after the movie is finished.It's rated ""PG"" for action and mild violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.Although it's not one that I would buy on DVD, I'm sure fans will love it more than I did and it would be a good one to stream.","

"fciocca","8 April 2023","Everything about ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" feels just right. This is how you respectfully treat one of the most famous franchises in history. There are several references to many of the great games that were released by Nintendo through the decades. I played many Super Mario titles during my childhood and teenage years and for me this was way better than I imagined. The story is simple, yet compelling and entertaining at the same time. The animation style is gorgeous. The locations and the soundtrack are stunning and evoked many memories. The characters are amazing and they are portrayed wonderfully by an amazing cast. I loved Jack Black's Bowser, Chris Pratt and Anya Taylor-Jones made justice to Mario and Princess Peach. I think that this is one of the few movies in recent years that truly managed to unite different generations together. When the credits rolled, the whole audience clapped, I never experienced something like this ever in all my years as a movie goer. I really do not want to say much more, as I do not want to spoil anything about the plot. If you are a fan of the franchise, just go to the cinema. These are well spent money.","

"pixrox1","30 November 2023",""" . . . You'll DIE!!"" warns Toad at the key moment of THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE. The Heartbreak of Fatal Magic Mushroom Trips was virtually unknown in America prior to Super Mario. Then a nefarious plot was hatched by the pernicious sore losers who instigated World War Two with their infamous sneak attack on our U. S. A. Homeland and then started wailing and sobbing when the righteous Fire of Heaven incinerated their false deity and war machine. Crazed for revenge, these incorrigible evil-doers infiltrated our shores with deadly drug promotions disguised as children's video games. Now they're rubbing in salt to injury with a film franchise to further cram deadly magic mushroom doses down the innocent throats of American kids.","

"matthutsonmovie","7 April 2023","This is a movie all kids and adults alike who are fans of the original game and all of the other Nintendo games dealing with Mario will love.Mario and Luigi are introduced as just average guys who dumped their life savings into their plumbing business. No one, including their parents and their family believes in them. They don't believe in their success or their ability to achieve. So, they have to set out to prove them all wrong.An opportunity presents itself when Brooklyn starts to flood. They set out to save the city but end up getting sucked into what we know and love as the games we played as children.The world building and graphics are amazing when they first get sucked into mushroom land. We get introduced to Peach and Toad and get to see you some amazing gameplay as if we were in the game itself (mushroom power-ups included). However, Luigi gets separated from Mario and captured by Koopa while Mario introduces himself to Princess Peach to get her help to save Luigi from Koopa. This is where I almost gave the movie 8 out of 10 because Princess Peach is presented as one of the most powerful and brave characters in the movie. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this, as Princess Peach and Mario have a great chemistry together. I do like her character a whole lot. In the original game she gets captured by Koopa but we don't know too much else about her character from the games so by all means make her a powerful character. Anya Taylor Joy does an amazing job voicing Princess Peach.The movie makes up for it later on and shows that Mario has potential to be the greatest and becomes the savior we all know and love. Chris Pratt does an amazing job voicing the character as well. In fact all of the characters did such a great job including Jack Black as Bowser!Overall, the story is solid, the World building is amazing and nostalgic yet novel. We're introduced to so many characters we love including Donkey Kong and a portion of the movie is reminiscent of Mario Kart. All I can say is that I loved it all and I recommend any Mario lover to watch it.","

"ThunderKing6","4 July 2023","(Minus 2 stars for the dog.) It was bothering the Bros. By trying to maul them. Why else was it acting like that?This review was made July 3rd 2023.What was this movie about?: it's another multiverse/matrix movie. The Bros are teleported into another universe where they take on a giant tortoise.Story and production overview: Peach is not the sweet, petite character that we are use to. In this she is no push over.So why does she need Mario?The animation is spotless.Voiceovers is a head scratcher. Not sure why they couldn't get a real Italian or the original Mario voice actor. Instead they stuck with STAR-Lord... Get it? Because Mario chases stars and the voice actor played Stsr-Lord.Anyways...The story is good enough for children, adults and fanboys.It's not an annoying film despite the dog scene.Genre: animation, children's, fantasy, video gameDuration: 1 hour and 30 minVillian: Bowser as a physical threat is good. He's powerful but his motives simpySoundtrack: It's cool.Overall: A very fun film. It's redeemed himself after that hash first Mario film. Though I can't believe it took them over 20 years to get Mario right after hundreds of the same cliche games.I just didn't like how they made Luigi into a weakling. It's humiliating.Highlight: Dog falling out of the window.. . Mario getting the mini mushroom.Villian: Bowser. He's a childish, simp Villian. When he Songs he reminds me of Chef.What can be learned? Well this is a children's movie. (fanboy movie too). It's sad realizing children are known targets of dog attacks and here we have a dog attempting to maul The Bros. That's not cool. That scene could give attack victims traumatic panick attacks.Verdict: Solid movie. Pure fun minus the dog scene. Makes you forget about the 93 film.","

This movie was fire and no matter what fan you are, this movie tops almost every other movie out so far this year!Again, do not listen to movie critics for all they want is for great animated movies to be pushed down while they give companies like Disney full blown 9.5/10... most of the time they are filthy lies and you should take an actual audience advice, nit these liars.","

"cardsrock","17 April 2023","Illumination could have completely phoned it on on this film, as an animated movie starring Nintendo's most beloved characters was pretty well guaranteed to make bank. I'm impressed with how much care and respect actually went into this film. Fans of Mario and Co. Will appreciate all of the clever references and amusing jokes left for those of us older fans. Meanwhile, kids alike will eat up the colorful visuals and funny gags.The story is light, as you might expect, but it's more than serviceable. The 90 minute runtime means the film never lets its foot off the gas. Pratt's voice isn't as distracting as I worried it might be, while Charlie Day and Jack Black steal the show with their brilliant casting. They definitely updated Peach with a splash of #GirlPower, but it's still Mario and Luigi's movie at its heart. Throw in some enticing after credits scenes and we have the makings of a full-blown mega-hit franchise.","

"badeclerck","2 January 2024","Let's be clear from the start : Super Mario Bros was crafted with one primary goal-to delight and cater to a massive community of fans. Embracing this premise, the film delivers an unabashed celebration of the iconic gaming universe that has been etched into our hearts since childhood. It's a whirlwind tour through a family of characters, a fast-paced homage to the games we've all cherished, even if the visitation is somewhat brisk.Undeniably, this isn't the film of the century, but it achieves what it sets out to do-it entertains, and it does so swiftly. The runtime breezes by, a testament to the film's intent to jog memories and evoke a sense of nostalgia in the shortest possible time. It's a delightful montage of familiar faces and game scenarios, a fond reminder of the diverse landscapes we've explored in the virtual realms.The film dabbles in every character and game we've encountered over the years, providing a rapid-fire trip down gaming history. While the speed might leave some wanting more depth, it aligns perfectly with the movie's objective: to spark joy, laughter, and wonder. Super Mario Bros' isn't aiming for profundity; it's aiming to tickle the funny bone and ignite a sense of marvel.In essence, the movie is a thank-you note to the fans, a gleeful acknowledgment of the shared joy that gaming has provided. It's a lighthearted, easily digestible experience that doesn't linger unnecessarily, ensuring that the audience leaves with a smile on their face. Thank you for bringing this anticipated film to life and for creating it with the intention to make us laugh, have fun, and be enchanted-mission accomplished.","

"FilmSchoolFlunk","10 April 2023","I loved every minute of this movie. It was everything it promised to be, and everything you'd expect. Funny throughout, cartoonish and goofy, nostalgia filled, action packed and a beautiful looking movie. Seeing my childhood come to life through all of the easter eggs and game-incorporations was amazing. It reminded me of so many memories and little things I forgot from the world of Super Mario. It leans on nostalgia to stake its claim but - when your a Super Mario movie, you can afford to do that. The animation was great as expected and the classic soundtrack remixes and alterations were great, accompanied by some well known music hits. I enjoyed traversing and navigating the mushroom kingdom, jungle, rainbow road and more, and it was so refreshing seeing the successful expansion of these small game maps - and the universe as a whole. I really liked how Mario and Luigi's backstory is shown and how they dont live in the mushroom kingdom - they stumble across it. I thought this was such a great was to craft a real story out of the games. I can happily say I wasn't let down by a single facet of the movie - it landed for me. This movie is not though provoking, deep or anything more than surface fun - and it never tries to be! You have to rate a movie based on what its objectives, goals and genre are, and if it succeeded in them. You can't go expecting fight club or apocalypse now out of every movie. For what this simple movie sets out to do - I think it nailed it, in every way.In terms of dislikes I guess I would have preferred if the ending never takes us back to Brooklyn. When Mario gets launched back there I was a tad disappointed as I felt it took me out of the fictional and beautifully crafted magic land. It felt a bit avengers like as bowsers ship shows up in our world and mayhem ensues on the streets of Brooklyn. I wish taking down bowser was self contained in the fictional world, and wasn't mixed in with the real.Overall, The Super Mario Bros Movie delivered on everything I wanted - Action, music, world building, character background, nostalgia, easter eggs, true to the games, and humor. I was smiling the entire time.","

"Chris_Z6492","6 April 2023","Since the creation of Super Mario Brothers franchise, the story of Mario was simple. A big enemy to be defeated in order to save the princess.This time, Mario is a regular human that travels to another world and have to save his brother Luigi from a big enemy. Nothing changed significantly. However, everything is oversimplified or is not explained at all. Mario never question why he is on another world. Peach never question the fact that a human could travel to that world. Even Mario's family live their lives as Mario and Luigi didn't disappear.In my opinion, the screenplay writers were more upset about adding more references to the movie more than creating a solid argument. Even they skipped Mario's characters arc at all. He is the same person after the Mushroom kingdom.I really enjoyed the movie, but I think that Illumination have to upgrade its writers. They showed that is possible to compete with Disney on animation quality, but a good idea or IP is not good enough to support a hole script.","

Drawing inspirations from the core franchises, Sprinkling in enough references, paying proper homage all the while going new and interesting directions with the plot, is a testament to how most videogame movies should be made. Perfect set of cast, absolute zero complaints, heck I wanna praise Chris Pratt & Jack Black so much for absolutely NAILING it! Absolutely no complaints on the movie, could it have been better?

"TheTexasChainstoreManager","18 May 2023","To put it simple; this is not a movie. This is merely a collection of CGI-ads for a bunch of Nintendo games, tied together with an extremely nonsensical, forced and forgettable story . So forgettable, you forget it as you're watching it. It's pretty much like the writer just had a checklist of games and references he wanted to include and then just shoehorned some sloppy padding in-between.Usually a successful animated movie bring an appeal to both young and old with it's comedy and charm, but this movie have non. This is just a bunch of ""Remember this? And this? It's Mario Kart! And now it's Super Mario Bros! And now it's Donkey Kong! And now....""So if you're looking for a movie that just references a bunch of Nintendo games, this is for you. If you're looking for a good and fun movie, this isn't it.","

"flippyfrogman","5 April 2023","While Illumination isn't known for making the strongest animated movies, The Super Mario Bros Movie is by far their best so far, rivaled only by the original Despicable Me. The animation in the movie was superb, the voice actors all did a surprisingly good job (especially Jack Black, who did really well as a hammy comedic villain), and, while it isn't a laugh riot or anything, there was still some good jokes that made me laugh. The references to the Mario games (which I won't spoil here for you to find on your own) are well integrated, and while some are a tad forced, it was still really cool to see these things return. All in all, it was a really fun time, and I'd recommend this to any Mario fan, or just someone who's looking for a fun animated movie.","

"chris_rowe-881-168820","11 April 2023","I remember watching the original mario film in the mid nineties and loving it however upon rewatching it 25 years later it's not as epic as I remembered. I'm not sure if it was sonic that inspired this or if they planned on a movie but it feels surprising an IP as popular as Mario has taken this long, I have to wonder if others have been attempted but Nintendo weren't keen, either way it's about time.What was very smart was this film not going down the traditional mario story because if it had, this movie would have been hated by this generation as a man saving a woman would be seen as a no no and tradition is no excuse, so mixing the story up was a smart move. The story overall was decent, nothing particularly special but I don't think many kids films have epic stories, as long as they make sense and flow then it's good enough.I'm unsure why huge names are needed in these kinda films, seems such a waste of money, but they seem to do it anyway, I guess they can entice fans in but personally I'm not convinced they were the right voices for the roles, Luigi in particular but overall nothing too disappointing.Lastly overall was a really good film, they held certain characters back for an obvious sequel and the 2 credit scenes indicated the one main missing character will be a big part of number 2 and I'm guessing it'll probably be wario based evil.","

One day, they are accidentally transported into a fantastical world, where they must try to rescue a captured princess.The Super Mario Bros. Movie is fantastic. Directors Aaron Horvath & Michael Jelenic have given us a film, that honors the source material, while also being hilarious, action-packed & leaving its own impact on the Super Mario legacy. There are so many set pieces in the movie, that made me feel super nostalgic of when I used to play all the various video games in the Super Mario franchise & this is its strongpoint. The animation is flawless. The 3D is duck-worthy. Chris Pratt is impressive as Mario. Pratt just sounds more like himself, than the iconic Mario voice fans know & love. Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Princess Peach. Charlie Day is awesome as Luigi. Jack Black is the star of the show, as Bowser. Black gives us another outstanding vocal performance, after his iconic voiceover as Po in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. Keegan-Michael Key is superb as Toad. Seth Rogen is hysterical as Donkey Kong. The supporting cast is excellent. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a must watch for fans of the Super Mario video games. Watch it & have an absolute whale of a time!","

"Kysugo","13 December 2023","Art style and animations were fantastic. The way they brought the Mario universe to life was beautiful. It's very nostalgic seeing all the callbacks and references from the video games. From a nostalgic point of view, this movie definitely delivers. I love how much personality and humanity they gave the characters in the movie, they really brought them to life. They got creative with their ideas, they even built upon and expanded the Mario universe. It was really sweet seeing the friendship and brotherly love that Mario and Luigi have for each other. The score for the movie was great. I love the way they took songs from the old games and put a modern, more cinematic twist on them. Although, the licensed 80's music really did throw the whole feel off and didn't fit the movie at all. They really could've done without that music. I think they put it in for the older viewers lol.It would've been so cool to see Luigi have a character arc in this movie. They even set it up for him, but in the end they don't do anything with it. It's interesting: it seems like Luigi is put in difficult and scary situations. Hopefully so he can grow as a character, so that he can be braver and more confident. Maybe Luigi is also holding onto past trauma or ghosts that he needs to let go of. I feel kind of bad for him, the poor guy always seems to get stepped on and doesn't get appreciated as much as Mario. I wish he'd stand up for himself and we can see him grow as a character. I actually thought it was cool how Mario was a nobody in the Mushroom Kingdom and he had to basically prove himself. They made Peach the cool badass character that can do anything and Mario the schlub underdog character. The way they did the entrance into Jungle Kingdom was amazing, very memorable. All the Mario Kart references were greatly appreciated.Now for the list of complaints lol. First thing, I think Seth Rogen doing the voice for DK was a mistake and a terrible idea. Don't get me wrong, I love Seth Rogen, but hearing him as DK threw me off completely. See the thing is, he didn't even try to sound different or put an interesting spin for DK's voice. It's literally Seth Rogen playing himself for the voice of DK - and that's problem. They even added his stoner laugh which was pretty cringe and unwelcome. My next complaint has to do with Luigi. Not so much with his character but rather lack of character involvement and lack of character arc/development. The disappointing part is that they set it up to make it seem like he was going to have an interesting character arc within the mansion or within the Dark Lands. But nope, they literally capture him, throw him in a cage and he spends almost the entirety of the movie forgotten in that cage. A wasted opportunity. A minor complaint I have has to do with Peach and how goofy they made her facial animations. They need to make her face look a little more prettier and a lot less goofier. I feel like they could've introduced more characters instead of just putting them in the background. They could've given more spotlight, even if it was for a couple of seconds, to Diddy and Dixie. That would've been cool to see. But maybe they're saving it for future projects. I understand you don't really play the Mario games to see any character development or depth, but it would've been really cool to see that in this movie. Especially given that this is the medium to do it in. At times it felt like they were teasing some character development between Mario and Peach, but then they would immediately move on, disregarding it. Same with DK and Mario. It's pretty much surface level stuff which is ok for this type of movie since the main focus is the action, excitement and thrill of it all, but it would've been so much better had they added some interesting character development/arcs. It would've elevated the movie that much more.Equal parts funny, cute, nostalgic, exciting and endearing. Overall it's a fun, entertaining and nostalgic ride of a movie. There's some really cool and exciting moments that stay with you. The story was very simple and straightforward, nothing really amazing. But it was still good, solid. The best part about the movie was looking in the backgrounds to find any easter eggs or video game references.","

Watch this classic ""Nintendo"" video game turned into a film.""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" was awesome. I loved every minute of it. If you didn't know this isn't their first attempt at a film. They made a live-action film back in 1993 with Bob Haskins and John Leguizamo. As a kid, I thought it was a little silly but I enjoyed watching it back then. Now trying to go back and watch it, it's pretty bad.John Leguizamo felt slighted about the new film. He felt like fans thought his '93 version was nostalgic. John planned on boycotting this one because of a lack of diversity. Which I don't know I agree with. When it comes to ""Mario"" and ""Luigi"" they weren't diverse at all. ""Mario"" accent was also terrible. Other than that I think the cast was very diverse in my opinion.The cast was spot on. Chris Pratt as ""Mario"" voice was a little off but as the film went along it was hard to notice it. Just here and there. I loved Anya Taylor-Joy as ""Princess Peach"". Seth Rogen voicing ""Donkey Kong"" had me cracking up, especially when he would laugh. Jack Black as ""Bowser"" stole the show. They let Jack Black be his authentic self. His song ""Peaches"" was hilarious and amazing. I liked it so much that I downloaded it.I loved the fact that this film was jam-packed but everyone still got their time to shine. Whether it was a major role or a cameo I felt like every pivotal or none pivotal character was seen. It was hilarious, fun, and entertaining. They did right by this esteemed video game franchise.They had multiple big scenes that paid homage to ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Smash Bros."", and ""Mario Kart"". You felt like you were playing on a massive screen and all you needed was a Nintendo 64, Game Cube, or for my newbies a Switch controller to get busy with.They squeezed a lot in a very short time. The kids enjoyed it and they had plenty of stuff that adults would find funny as well. Plus everyone no matter their age can relate to playing some version of this game. This is the beginning. I expect multiple sequels from this. This is Nintendo's baby. They wouldn't make it if it wasn't done right. Now it's the highest-grossing animated film ever.After watching the ""Tetris"" film and now this. I need to see a ""Nintendo"" origin film. It's time. Another video game franchise, done right. So far ""Last of Us"" and ""Mario"" are the only two. I took my daughter, bring your whole family. All are welcome. I give it five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"tpawkrypt","9 April 2023","First off too many people expect a Mario film to be the way THEY want it to be. When have we had the exact same Mario games repeatedly? There's always a difference somewhere.This is a different medium of media for Mario than what we are used to and it done things the Hollywood way, but I would say it felt like Nintendo had their hands in this a lot.It's a film about the Super Mario Bros. Let's not complicate things and throw around lore and ""this wasn't accurate as per the games"" etc. This is a fun film. Kids will love, adults will love it.If you are a huge fan of Mario park your expectations at the door and enjoy this version for what it was intended to be.If you aren't a huge fan of Mario or you don't have an opinion on Mario I'd argue you could still enjoy this movie very much. It's funny, has great pacing, the Easter eggs are there if you want them, but it does soft touch hand holding for those who may not be familiar with the IP.I think it was a great balance between entry level and enjoyable for hardcore fans (who don't take themselves too seriously).Penguinz0 review sums it up the best (he doesn't include spoilers per se but hints at a lot).","

"industriousbug","16 April 2023","Flat, visual noise.Fundamentally incurious. Potentially injurious.The mystique generated by the characters in the games is here raked over and presented haphazardly by hacks.A hobbled attempt to explain a long and random evolution of characters who were never meant to be narratised fails. Doing it well is near impossible when you insist on EVERY LITTLE BIT OF LORE, from the last forty years being shoehorned into 90 minutes.Makes little sense, shamelessly leans on member berries to stimulate older viewers but offers nothing else.I feel sad for the animators who did a sterling job, but to no end as this movie has no soul.","

"meepsonic","26 August 2023","After the Mario Movie grossed $1 Billion in under the span of a month, I'm tired of people saying positive things about the movie while the negative reviewers get defecated on because our reviews are our opinion that they don't like.""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" was horrible, and I wish it was never made market in the box office to success.On Twitter, user pointed out that the Mario movie plagiarized almost every bit of a plot from the Angry Birds movie.Now for the casting, Chris Pratt was awful by doing his Italian voice, in fact, it was so bad that they made the plumbing commercial with the awful voice just to make fun of the fans who hated his voice. Chris Pratt said, ""I understand that the people don't want someone to come along and destroy a popular character, because it's a cash grab"". In response from John Leguizamo who boycott the movie says ""Like I was groundbreaking and, they stopped the groundbreaking"" because of the movie's exclusion of Latino characters.So for the catchphrase, the voices were too drunk like, Mario saying ""It's-a-me"" in slow motion, the old wahoo voice was heard in the movie trailer, same with Charles Martinet who also said that. Also, the scene while at the rainbow road, I pointed out that there's a catchphrase which sounds similar to the pigeon's laugh in the 2019 animated film called ""Spies in Disguise"" which stars Will Smith, and Tom Holland.","

"superkodu","20 May 2023","This is an interesting film to think about because when you look at it one way it is a movie CLEARLY made for fans of the Super Mario franchise, the Nintendo franchise. There are references and callbacks that are QUITE often in the film to over 40 years of Super Mario gaming history. I would say that if you didn't grow up being a fan of Video Games or Nintendo, then you will have a hard time to understanding this movie. BUT, there is still some amazing storytelling being presented through the soundtrack that is (Italian Plumber's kiss). There's amazing storytelling told through the art design and camera work. The character designs and the designs of the world's had so much detail and thought. You can tell that they didn't want to miss a beat with that. The Voice acting in my opinion worked very well. This is the first time we see a Mario on screen, and Chris Pratt did a great job for making the voice his own. Everyone did a great job.Like I said, you either have to take this movie for what it is, or you don't. It's a Great Kid's movie, Mario Movie, Nintendo Movie, Video Game Movie. As A Movie Movie, that's a matter of opinion. Everyone will have a different experience with this movie. But as someone who has grown up a Die Hard Mario fan, I enjoyed this movie, and it more than put a smile on my face. Well done Nintendo, and Illumination.P. S.-I'm ready for your Zelda and Metroid movie now. :)","

"Rayve777","6 April 2023","I've got to say that whoever edited the trailers did Chris Pratt dirty, he actually sounds pretty good in the movie. While he only really brings out the classic voice for a commercial gag in the beginning he replicates Martinet pretty well, and the New York accent he uses for the movie sounds good as well. Most of the cast does a pretty good job as well, with Jack Black obviously stealing the show, but Anya Taylor-Joy's performance was actually pretty disappointing as it felt pretty wooden. Seth Rogen was by far the worst though, he just sounds like himself, annoying laugh and all.The story was pretty standard but I really didn't mind it too much, with the comedy either actually being pretty funny or just cringe. There was way too much licensed music though, if they actually played the ""wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy"" song it honestly wouldn't be too out of place.","

"Oopsilon0047","15 August 2023","A light fun filled movie with not much plot twists. A great watch if you want to chill and have some fun. I am not an OG gamer or such and didn't nolay Mario much. Also, I am not much familiar with most Nintendo games. Still the movie was a great experience. The animation and music is great. The Parkour, runs and karting are done well and it feels exciting to watch these moments. The story is pretty much simple story of bowser wanting peach and also to rule the world. The Mario brothers trying to make a living getting trapped in an alternate world with talking mushroom and other fictitious beings is a nice concept. All the characters that comes and all the kingdoms we see are also well written and animated which makes it a very good experience to watch.","

The voice actors got some flack from some B lister actor who starred in the terrible 90's Mario movie, but the complaints have bounced off like Mario on a Mushroom.Peach seems a bit more ""feminist"" shall we say and not exactly the traditional damsel in distress we expect, but otherwise this is a fun movie well worth a watch.","

"potatochip00","9 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2023 is a movie that I won't be able to remember in a week. The movie is average at best but mostly for super fans and little kids.The relationships had me disappointed the most. Most are just one dimensional and the princess is yet another mary sue character.in a sea of mary sues in todays media. The original mario was simple but the stakes were higher. Mario goes to save the princess. How the writers failed in making this on par is beyond me.In what world is it so easy to see the royal family by chance. The royal family must be doing a s**tty job in defending the kingdom.For whatever reason the toads decided to make peach a princess. She looked different and was mysteriously skilled at everything but they did not question if she was a spy.The princess leaves the faith of the kingdom in mario to secure a foreign army, someone she doesn't know very well. What happened to her own army and defences? Did she have a backup plan for when mario failed?Mario having to complete the obstacle course before adventuring out is dumb. Almost as if power ups are conveniently placed in the world for the plot and that the princess knew that he'd be challenged.Also,why was mario even asked to duel instead of the princess??It felt like I was in a zoo being showcased all the mario characters in a dumb children's playThe mario games, in essence, is an adventure. This movie wasn't about the adventure but about the destination with some parkour.I liked the mario game as a kid but I wasn't a super fan. So if the writing isn't good, what's the point?","

"vincentviolet-65071","20 May 2023","This movie should win oscars. I'm not even jokes. The CGI / animation is beautiful. It looks just as good as the new Mario games but it is a movie. I loved to play Super Mario 64 when I was a child so watching this movie is kind of a dream come true. I've not even finished watching it but I had to stop and write a review because it is so good. If you are a fan of any of the Super Mario games then you should watch this because it is great. I think you could probably enjoy it even if you don't know the games but it is better if you do. They have thrown in lots of stuff for the fans, like sometimes when Mario is running around they shift the camera to angles where it looks like you are playing a Mario game. They have all the main characters and places and stuff you could want from the Mario games. I generally don't expect much at all from movies these days but this one is really really good. My favourite thing is Mario and Luigi;s brother dynamic, it makes me wish I had a brother like that and we could cosplay as Mario and Luigi. All the actors are great but Charlie Day as Luigi is my favourite. I'm a huge fan of it's always sunny so it's a nice weird surprise to see him play Luigi. This is a really great film and it deserves to be very successful and it really should win oscars especially for the visuals / cgi you won't see a better looking movie this year that's a guarantee and Princess Peach is a hot piece of ass.","

Laughed out loud at times. My kids all loved it and said they can't wait for the next one to come out. Especially with the after credit scene.Disney has made it clear that they are more interested in pushing their ""values"" on young children and now Universal has filled the void left by Disney.I thought the voice acting was really good. The animation was outstanding and there is stuff for all ages to enjoy. If your looking for a good time out with the fam, you won't regret seeing Mario.","

"cjonesas","29 April 2023","An insane animation for all lovers of Nintendo Super Mario character and his ""Mama Mia"" family. The story is not super bright, as many pointed out has the general and sophisticated feel of a Nintendo video game, fictionalized of course, besides Mario's training in the Mushroom Kingdom.It was entertaining for its 90 minutes, loved it, could have been 15 minutes more or less depending on the development and fillers. Seems to me that 10 minutes less would have been better, more compact and with more fluidity. Singing and piano playing, c'mon, even kids won't find that amusing, cause it's about staticness and love, two things that kids won't relate to. They love action, color and movement, fortunately the movie has plenty of those and more for the delight of kids and parents alike.""In an insane world, sanes are called insane"".

A sequel would, however, also give the writers the opportunity to invest in some Mario and Yoshi action.","

"cricketbat","16 April 2023","I wish that we had gotten The Super Mario Bros. Movie back in 1993 instead of the live-action dumpster fire we were given. This would have been a dream come true back then because it's a fun & faithful recreation of the NES games I grew up on. However, it's obvious that this movie was made for kids. It's not as humorous as I had hoped it would be and there are a few shortcomings I can't really overlook as an adult. And I don't think the rising generation will appreciate this adaptation like I would have because the games are so old. It's a great video game adaptation that arrived just a little too late.","

"markovd111","21 April 2023","Basically, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a great movie about legendary video game characters. It's fast and doesn't worry to much about explaining it's plot flow (which is great), it has a lot of Easter eggs and nods to the Super Mario franchise and Nintendo in general and it's overall enjoyable and funny movie great for a Sunday afternoon watch with your loved ones. English voices are great and I recommend it that you watch it with English audio. My only complaint is that in one scene Princess Peach tells to the whole of the mushroom people that Mario is just a nobody. While it makes sense from the plot perspective, I was left with my mouth opened. I couldn't help myself than to think that this was done just to remove any idea that Princess Peach needs help from Mario. She is portrayed as a hero and a capable warrior (which I don't have anything against, since she is a playable character in some of the games and more than capable of handling all the game's challenges), but this scene was too much for me. Other than that, movie is everything a Mario fan could have wanted. I give it 9/10 and I recommend it to everyone!","

This movie has the elements of the game, but no originality.It's just a clone of every other cartoon movie made in the past decade. The same jokes. The same mug-takes. The same cutesy jokes. The same character reactions. It's all the same.The only difference is that this is wrapped in the Mario game mythos. But it's not enough.The story is a bore-fest.I kept fading in and out because it's just not exciting in the sllightest. It really needed a far better writer to help take this film to an enjoyable level.In the end, the film is a huge disappointment.","

"philiptballas","6 December 2023","This movie was so incredibly MID. The animation was phenomenal, but they absolutely fumbled the bag on this screenplay, plot, and dialogue. Atrocious. Chat GPT could have done a better job. Sometimes I think they keep the dialogue so basic in order to appeal to a foreign speaking market. Because this was the most heavy-handed, on the nose writing I have seen in a children's movie. Character development was essentially nonexistent, and they tried to cram too many characters into an incredibly short timeframe. Plus they could've done so much more with the plot. I imagine the plot as going from different biome to biome, from jungle, to desert, to ice, to water etc. As in the Mario games. Instead, we only got this brief excursion to Donkey Kong's land which felt like a side mission. The movie ended so abruptly too. I thought that they were just getting started on the mission when all of a sudden they were in the final battle with Bowser. Putting some references in will make a lot of people like the movie, but that is the low watermark in my opinion. There was so much more that they could have done with this movie. How could they spend 100 million on it and this is all they come up with?","

"burntoutboy","5 April 2023","I had so much hope for this but it just fell flat for me. Let's start with the positives.The animation is absolutely brilliant, the best illumination have done. It really captures Mario and the Mario world. It is all very nostalgic with lots of Easter eggs. The music is great too.Now for the negatives.The story was just plain, nothing special and really let the movie down considering how well it was animated. I know it's aimed for kids but thought it would be abit more interesting and engaging. What was really surprising was how unfunny it was, didn't laugh once. I was in a busy cinema filled with kids and I barely heard a chuckle which says it all.It will probably go on to make a lot of money and will probably have sequels, I just hope with the sequels they do a better story for them.","

"MovieWarfare","7 April 2023","Nintendo has decided to give another attempt after the disastrous 1993 live-action Super Mario Bros movie. Super Mario is a huge part of my childhood, so I was thrilled at the idea of a movie that actually resembles the game. I was a little put off by the not-so-positive critic's review but is their score justified?Let's get the biggest worry out of the way, Chris Pratt as Mario. He is all right in the role. I think he does a good voice for Mario that works for the whole runtime. Likewise, Charlie Day as Luigi is good as well. The first act of the movie with Mario and Luigi together is incredibly enjoyable. The pacing is great and they do a great job illustrating the strong bonds between the brothers. This is also thanks to the great chemistry between Chris and Charlie. In terms of great voice performance, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad is terrific. We have seen in interviews that he does the high pitch voice without just sound editing tricks. His voice as Toad works perfectly for the film while still having the same energy as Toad in the game. He is only outshined by the best voice performance in the whole film, Jack Black as Bowser. Jack Black gives a voice performance that actually sounds different from his normal voice to the point that you won't be able to tell it is him. His voice was perfect as Bowser's as he gave a menacing tone but a slight goofiness to the performance as well. Charles Martinet (the video game Mario voice) is also here and not just as a cameo which I appreciate as well.Brian Tyler is the music composer for this film and he does a great job. They incorporated a lot of the great music from the Mario games into the film wonderfully. He sometimes does it subtlety and sometimes uses it fully for big moments but it is done tastefully. The visuals are also great and they did a great job of making the world of Mario look alive. This is definitely one of Illumination's best-looking films. There are also some great, enjoyable action sequences such as the obstacle course that reminds you of the classic games, Mario vs Donkey Kong, the Rainbow Road, and the whole final act. These sequences utilize the elements from the game superbly. On that note, there are so many references and easter eggs to not just Mario but Nintendo in general. There are easter eggs in the sounds, the music, the visuals, and the dialogue and it is just a lot of fun spotting it all. There is no doubt that this movie was created with the fans in mind.However, I do have some issues with this film. The first is the plot splitting up Mario and Luigi. It was great seeing them interact but the movie hints at some issues in their relationship and the movie could've explored their brotherly relationship. Unfortunately, the plot splits them up and changes it to be about Mario rescuing Luigi which is super generic. It's a shame, as the plot didn't need to be about Mario saving anyone as Bowser was already a looming threat anyway. The plot being straightforward isn't a massive problem though. The issue is that there is no proper character exploration or development in this straightforward plot. Every character remains the same from beginning to end, except for one character but they just change because the plot demands it to. It isn't naturally built up or earned. Peach's character is also just perfect with no flaws which is kind of boring. The pacing is also incredibly fast after the first act. The movie doesn't spend any time letting a scene breathe with our characters. It is always on to the next thing almost instantly. This is jarring as I wanted to see more of the adventures with Mario and Peach but this is just dealt with in a quick montage.In terms of voice performances, I do have issues with some. Anna Taylor Joy is just phoning it in as Peach. She is just speaking in her normal voice and that is fine just because her normal voice suits the character but I wish she put some effort into it. Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong is another performance where they are just speaking in their normal voice. I don't like the casting of Seth and the film doesn't change my mind. On that note, Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong is another big miscasting. He doesn't sound old enough or cranky enough as the character. There is also a weird creative choice in having 80s song in the film. There is AC/DC Thunderstruck and Take on Me in the film and it is just very off-putting. These songs didn't work for the scene and I'm not sure why they put the songs in a Mario movie. I also didn't find the jokes laugh out loud funny but kids were laughing so it was maybe that the jokes just aren't funny for adults.Overall, my biggest worry was The Super Mario Bros movie sucking. Fortunately, this movie does not suck and is actually a very fun movie. I do think the critics were a bit harsh but their criticisms are understandable. The movie plays it very safe with the plot and characters. There is not any meaningful message in this film. Nevertheless, the movie succeeds in delivering a fun Mario adventure that is fun for kids while being enjoyable enough for adults. A kid behind me in my theatre called it the 'best movie ever' so clearly it is doing something right! Hopefully, this movie opens the door for more Mario or Nintendo properties getting their own film adaptions. Luigi's Mansion, Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Kirby! The possibilities are endless!","

"subxerogravity","6 April 2023","Celebrate over 40 years of Mario with the Super Mario Bros. The Movie. If you love Mario like that this film is the most trivial history of the world's most famous Plumber. For those who play the most recent games you'll see visual elements coming from the games that will get you excited. As an old head I smiled when they made old school references to the history of the Mario Bros. Especially happy that they focused on Mario and Luigi's organs as Italian Americans from Brooklyn, over whatever that accent they are doing in the games now is from.As far as the voice over controversy is concern, I'll give credit to Chris Pratt whose performance seem truer to Mario than it did his Star power, which is overall weird cause it seems you would hire Pratt to hear his voice come out of Mario. In the opposite of Pratt, it felt like Seth Rogen was trying too hard to assure you knew he was Donkey Kong. None of the voice over choices truly wowed me. The only talent worth it was Jack Black. He was not the best King Koopa, but he gave us to ballets in the film that were definitely Jack Black and that was good for some laughing.I cannot see anyone disliking the film. If you're a true die-hard Mario fan you'll notice that animation is up to pair with the visually amazing worlds Nintendo has built in these games. The colorfulness will generate with anyone who loves animated movies and the story is grown up enough to keep everyone interested (Does not help that everyone loves Mario Mario. Right?)","

"InstaNetCo","17 April 2023","No bloopers here, just my opinion on this excellent movie and also my opinion on the bad ""Metascore"" (very low in my opinion). First of all, the only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because I'm very selective in terms of 10s. I've watched literally thousands of movies and only 9 films and 8 of them were made before the 1950s so you get an idea. So this movie getting a 9 from me is huge.That aside, having been born in 1985 I was lucky enough to have grown with Mario Bros, from regular Nintendo, Nintendo 64 and Game cube I played most of mario games and although I never thought my self of a huge fan of this particular video game like I was a fan of Metal Gear Solid and games of that sort I deeply enjoyed the playability and storytelling behind Mario saga.I went to the 11 pm showing on a Sunday which was full and that's already surprising for any movie these days, specially for the day and time. I was captivated right from the beginning as soon as I realized the trama was not necessarily childish but one that would reach all audiences, making you feel like back in the 90s with the music and keeping it Simple and not ""progressive"" which I found very interesting considering the times we live in. This is a story that began in the late 80s and the director made sure to keep it that way. That's something I really appreciate and will make me comfortable to show to the younger crowd in my family. And this is my comment on the low metascore: how is it possible that this movie did not meet most ""experts"" expectations just because it didn't include any of the new wave characters? Really? I mean there is a space for everything, why would you forcibly include something that was never part of the original story? Didn't you all see the huge mess buzz lightyear was? Here's the funny part, a couple of my friends are part of the L. G..... community and guess what? They loved the film just the way it was.I'm Hispanic and I have zero issues with watching movies where there aren't any Latin people. Also if the Latin person in a movie happens to be a servant or something of that sort, guess what? I would never be offended. So please let's try and bring back good movies just by keeping things simple and real. There are plenty storyline and spaces for all minorities to shine but we don't have to be present in every single one of them. Let's try to bring back a simple world like Mario times when victimhood was not a thing and you could go about your day without feeling you've offended Someone just by speaking your mind.Thank you Mario, never thought I could watch a 2023 movie that made me feel like this did.Congratulations to the team and all actors involved.If your haven't watched yet, don't miss it .","

"trinaboice","31 October 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
Can you believe I've never played any of the Mario Brothers games? I have four sons, so it definitely was played in my home for years. I tried playing it once, but that was when my kids were out for blood and absolutely did not let me win just to humor me. They would kill me within minutes. I did notice that whether my sons had guy friends or girl friends over to hang out, everyone wanted to play it. I spent a lot of money on Nintendo over the years!While critics are not loving this thinly-plotted movie adaptation, fans are giving it a big thumbs up and being swept away by the nostalgia. Because the game has been so beloved for four decades, the pressure was definitely on to get it right. The film was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. The script was written by Matthew Fogel.THINGS I LIKED:
The fantastic voice talent includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Kevin Michael Richardson. They all did an excellent job. Many of them showed up at the premiere wearing outfits that paid tribute to their characters. Cute!Jack Black had some great moments in the movie. I always love it when he sings! It's never great, but always hilarious.Seth Rogen's laugh is so recognizable, so it was funny to hear Donkey Kong laugh like that.Fans will get a kick out of all the hidden Easter eggs, which are many! In fact, the game appears to be designed as pure fan service. If you see this in the movie theater, you'll be surrounded by enthusiastic fans who will cheer and clap, making it all the more fun.It's extremely colorful with enough details in every frame to keep you entertained and engaged. I love details.I love that simple scenes include the up-and-down movement of the game, as characters jump and climb to get over obstacles. Clever.Nice animation brings the video game back to life but in a more detailed way. The pasta looked delicious!Lots of amusing humor, both spoken and visual.The music and sound effects are super fun.The Mushroom Kingdom looks fantastic and so magical! That's when the movie really came alive for me.It's one of the best video-game adaptations I've seen on the Big Screen.Adorable ending.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There is no real character growth.Because I've never played the game, I was hoping to learn more about the characters and backstories.Adults who have never played the game won't be as interested, deciding it's just a whole lot of color and noise like a cartoon that plays on the TV while the kids engage with other toys and activities in the same room.The plot is very simple and thin. I agree with the critics. The story doesn't move the scenes forward. Instead, the scenes exist for fan service with a weak plot that stitches them together.Some of the songs don't quite fit the video game but will resonate with older fans of the Nintendo era.I wanted to see all of the details in the backgrounds, but they were usually blurred out.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Talk of killing someone
Some ""light"" profanity
Lots of destruction
People and creatures in perilous situations.!","

"masonsaul","8 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie has a very thin plot but remains really good fun thanks to a fast pace and constant stream of recognisable callbacks to the game and loads of action. The character arcs are simple but effective, the jokes aren't hilarious but rarely annoying and it's way better than the previous attempt to translate it to the big screen.After all the fuss it turns out Chris Pratt is actually a good Mario, he doesn't completely feel like stunt casting, the Brooklyn accent works and there's the odd flourish of that classic voice. Charlie Day is surprisingly the more distracting of the two Mario Bros but it's not a big problem, he's still really good and the brotherly dynamic is heartwarming.Keegan-Michael Key is great as Toad, he definitely feels like the person trying the hardest to distance their character from their actual voice. Jack Black is easily the best performance of the film though, a skilled and natural voice actor and perfect casting with a really funny and catchy song to top it off.Rounding out the cast is Anya Taylor-Joy and Seth Rogen who really just sound like themselves but in a way that isn't annoying and always enjoyable, unlike Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong who is probably the most distracting voice of the whole cast.The animation is incredible, easily some of Illumination's best work with a nice balance between highly detailed environments and more stylised character designs, all of which is extremely faithful. The soundtrack of 80s classics doesn't really work (holding out for a hero again?!) but it's counterbalanced by Brian Tyler's score which is unabashedly epic and contains plenty of the classics themes.","

"andreineculau","21 April 2023","The movie is a huge miss and a disappointment beyond words. Story, nope. Dialogue, nope. Funny, nope. Fun, not besides seeing the characters we all love. It's just a salad of screaming, explosions, slow mo, racing, camera angles. Can you do a Super Mario movie without explosions? Probably not. Do you have to do one only with explosions? Definitely not. Waste of time for nostalgic adults, and definitely not what i want my kids to remember Super Mario for. Whatever reminds you of the good things about Super Mario is inserted just so you can't say it's not there, beyond amateur and kitsch........","

"okpilak","4 August 2023","It threaded the needle of safeness. Nothing to really scare the younger viewers, and really nothing to offend older ones, and that includes parents. A rather light hearted approach to almost every scene. It may soon be forgotten, as it is tied to the video game more than any eternal principles. But a pleasant enough way to pass some time. Politically astute people may have laughs each time seeing the toad people, but few others will know that reference. It is a decent animation job, but really nothing to be over awed with. One can watch without thinking, and some of where it is going is pretty obvious. But that is all right for what it is.","

"jasynp","7 April 2023","There are so many Easter eggs and fun tributes to the Mario franchise. My entire family saw it together with all different levels of Mario experience, and we all really enjoyed it for different reasons. Not all movies need complicated plots or a secret villain reveal to be enjoyable. Where the movie excels is creating the universe and building on the characters that we know so well. They were able to translate the characters in a smooth comedic way (especially Bowser) and it sets up many different storylines for future movies or other media. I highly recommend watching it in the theater as there are many small details rendered into the scenes that brought a smile to my face.","

"nikitacpv","22 April 2023","I was so excited for this movie to come out since I have been playing the Mario games ever since I was little.It's never a good thing to be excited for something and then ending up disappointed, which luckily I did.Let's start with the positives.The casting couldn't have been better. Although I am a fan of Chris Pratt and I can't wait to see him on the big screen soon with the third volume of Guardians of the Galaxy, I did have my doubts about him being cast as the voice of Mario. Luckily Pratt did one heck of a job.The best casting choices were those of Bowser (Jack Black) and Princess Peach (Anna Taylor Joy). It felt like they were made to do the voices of 2 ""beloved"" characters.Throughout the movie there were a lot of references made to the games, especially with the power-ups which I thoroughly enjoyed.If I have to say two ""bad"" things about the movie is that first of all, I wish they would have started out in a fictional world for starters instead of New York. Second of all it's a real bummer that my personal favorite Yoshi wasn't part of the movie.","

When you watch a movie and you get tears of joy, not only because of the film itself, which was great btw, but when it also makes you feel nostalgic? That's this movie. Take if from an early 90's kid who started in the gaming community with classics on the SNES and Super Mario World. If were one of those kids back then, and you enjoy that good feeling of nostalgia, then spare an hour and 30 minutes of your life watching this beautiful masterpiece. You won't feel disappointed watching this movie. Jack Black actually enjoyed his role of Bowser too. :'D.","

The kids Loved it!!! It's hard to imagine kids wouldn't like this movie. Think the only negative reviews have to be disgruntled adults who need to play more Mario video games! This movie was really interesting ho they blended and connected all the main Mario Nintendo characters and put the plot together. Was curious how they would achieve the video game feel which it didn't have too much or too little of. They nailed it just perfectly. Highly recommend!","

"dmoorejr","6 April 2023","Absolutely incredible. I'll start by saying I wasn't thrilled to hear that Chris Pratt was voicing Mario. My mind was changed immediately. The creative ways they use the old school nostalgia to influence this modern take was seamless, and straight up jaw dropping at times. They managed to give us a strong cast of characters. And the relationship Mario had with his bro Luigi is the root of the movie. The visual effects were top notch. I couldn't ask for a better Mario movie. Of course they set things up for a sequel. I was surprised just how much lore they set up in this first flick. Definitely check this out if you are a Mario fan.","

"foaadsm","10 April 2023","The Super Mario Brothers franchise has been beloved by gamers of all ages for decades, and now it has finally made its way to the big screen in the form of an animated feature film. From start to finish, the movie delivers a delightful and engaging experience that will leave audiences of all ages grinning from ear to ear.One of the most impressive aspects of the movie is its stunning animation. The characters and environments are brought to life in gorgeous detail, with vibrant colors and smooth movements that capture the essence of the iconic video game franchise. The sound design is equally impressive, featuring the familiar music and sound effects that fans have come to know and love.In terms of storytelling, the movie strikes a perfect balance between humor, action, and heart. It follows the adventures of Mario and Luigi as they journey through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser. Along the way, they encounter a colorful cast of characters, each with their own unique quirks and personalities.But what really sets this Super Mario Brothers movie apart is its ability to appeal to both longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise. It features plenty of nods to the games, from power-ups and enemies to iconic locations like the Mushroom Kingdom and Bowser's Castle. At the same time, it tells a story that is accessible to anyone, with well-developed characters and a satisfying narrative arc.Overall, the Super Mario Brothers movie is a joy to watch from start to finish. With its stunning animation, engaging storytelling, and faithful representation of the beloved video game franchise, it's a must-see for fans and newcomers alike.","

"ThereelscoopwithKK","9 May 2023","If you try to think too hard and analyze this movie in depth you are wasting your time. It is simply meant for a good time , to provide some excitement to young kids, and provide some nostalgia to its older audiences. There is no real character building because it is expected you've been with these characters for a long time.Of course as a member of the older audience I was hoping for more, but there was still enough there to make me smile at times.For me anyways, Bowser started out as interesting and I wish he'd remained the big baddy throughout. The movie went downhill a bit for me when Bowser just became goofy. This decision was certainly geared towards getting laughs out of the younger audience which is fine.Overall the ending is acceptable, and with box office sales you can be sure they will have several more chances to impress you or steal more of your coins (Mario reference) over the coming years .","

You just need a voice that fits right.The animation is 10/10 without an excitation. The whole movie has lots of things that remind SNES, N64, Wii games. All generations can enjoy this movie. Even if you never played any Mario game in your life, you will enjoy this movie. Movie made for true Mario's franchise Fans.","

"rexmatthewj","9 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2023 is a computer-animated adventure comedy film based on the popular video game franchise by Nintendo. It is produced by Illumination and directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who previously worked on Teen Titans Go! And Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. The film features the voices of Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and many others.The film follows the story of Mario and Luigi, two plumbers from Brooklyn who are transported to the Mushroom Kingdom, a magical world where they must rescue Princess Peach from the evil King Bowser and his army of Koopas. Along the way, they encounter various characters and locations from the games, such as Toad, Yoshi, Kamek, Cranky Kong, Spike, Penguin King, and more.The film is a fun and colorful tribute to the Super Mario Bros. Games, with plenty of references and Easter eggs for fans to enjoy. The animation is vibrant and expressive, capturing the charm and whimsy of the Mushroom Kingdom. The voice cast does a great job of bringing the characters to life, especially Pratt as Mario, who delivers a charismatic and energetic performance. The humor is witty and clever, with jokes that appeal to both kids and adults. The action scenes are exciting and creative, with inventive use of power-ups and obstacles.""However, the film is not without its flaws. The plot is rather thin and predictable, with few surprises and twists. The film relies too heavily on nostalgia and fan service, without adding much originality or depth to the story or the characters. Instead, it relies on clichés and tropes that have been seen before in many other animated films. Some of the voice choices are questionable, such as Rogen as Donkey Kong, who sounds too much like himself and not enough like a gorilla. Furthermore, the film feels rushed and overstuffed, with too many characters and subplots that are not given enough development or screen time. Despite all of these flaws, I still enjoyed the movie.""Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2023 is a enjoyable and entertaining film for fans of the games and animation lovers alike. It is not a masterpiece or a groundbreaking work of art, but it is a solid and satisfying adaptation of one of the most beloved video game franchises of all time.","

"The_Light_Triton","16 April 2023","30 years ago, a character who was beloved by children and teenagers was given a movie that would be the first of many based upon the growing medium of video games. That movie was based upon the popular video game series, Super Mario Bros.Then the fans came to see it...and either left the theatre disappointed, or simply scratching their heads. The people who made it had no idea who Mario was or the tone the games were trying to set. Now, in 2023, we finally have a movie about the now legendary plumbers that we can be proud of.Mario and Luigi are plumbers in a cartoonish version of Brooklyn. One night, the city has a plumbing problem that springs the brothers into action, hoping to save the day and be heroes. However, upon exploring the depths of Brooklyn's sewer system, the brothers are transported to a different world through a green pipe, and so begins their adventure into the Mushroom Kingdom.This movie was great, because the creators, unlike their predecessors, knew their source material and knew it well. There are many, many references to the world of Nintendo within the movie, in objects, musical pieces, and lines the characters say. Each character is well cast. Mario & Luigi behave exactly how they would in the games. Princess Peach is as independent as she is a playable character in many of the games, dating back to 1988's Super Mario Bros 2 on the original NES. Toad is as eccentric as he should be. Bowser is the thirsty simp for the princess that we have gotten to know over the years. The list goes on and anyone who's spent the better part of their childhood playing the games will have a good time noticing all the references to the games.Two things that disappointed me was the fight between Mario & DK lacking a reference to the Super Smash Bros series. The movie makes a reference to the original game multiple times, as well as the Mario Kart series, but the fight scene had no reference to the Super Smash Bros games. That's a missed opportunity. There were times during the fight the weapons from the games could've appeared (The home run bat, the laser sword, the hammer, the party ball) and there could've been a reference to being knocked off the stage, but there wasn't.The other disappointment was the eel that was used in place of Big Bertha, the giant cheep cheep. The eel was definitely a terrifying character in Super Mario 64 but Big Bertha was just as terrifying but dangerous in Super Mario Bros 3 and would've been more recognizable in this one.Regardless, this movie is exactly what the fans wanted 30 years ago and never got. The fact is, movies based upon video games don't have to be bad, as long as you know your source material and don't take a world of liberties you're going to make a great movie. And this movie does it right. Kids, and kids of the 90's and 2000's will have a ball and enjoy this one.There's likely to be a sequel, hopefully we'll meet the characters this film missed, like Princess Daisy, Wario & Waluigi, Thwomps, Chain Chomp...","

The film is part of the Nintendo's Super Mario franchise, featuring the iconic character Mario.The film is a true success. First and foremost, the animation is remarkably well-done. The colors are vibrant and bright, the movements are fluid, and the details of the characters are incredibly well-rendered. Children will certainly be fascinated by the well-known characters such as Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach, while adults will appreciate the subtle references to the franchise's video games. The background music is also a strong element of this film. The original video game compositions from the franchise are used cleverly and creatively, adding a family-friendly and joyful atmosphere to the entire film. The French version is also well-done, with appropriate voices and impeccable lip synchronization.Furthermore, the film does not have major weaknesses. The screenplay is simple but effective, the humor is present, and the characters are endearing. The film will certainly appeal to children, as well as adults who are nostalgic for the video game franchise.In conclusion, ""Super Mario Bros"" is a successful animated film that deserves to be watched by families. The animation, music, and screenplay are well-done and will captivate both children and adults.

The graphics were insane,it was filled with actions scenes and a BUNCH of different characters from the mario series. They were splattered everywhere,all tho you might wanna get the tickets early if you wanna watch the show in the first few days/weeks,because the first time i went half an hour early,there were no tickets and i have to book theme for tommorow. When it comes down to the story,it was good but not that well excecuted but i had a lot of fun throughout the film and it really didnt feel like 90 minutes.Easy 9.5/10 as a mario fanboi.","

"badoli","14 May 2023","I like the games because they are examples of the finest gaming experiences you can get. From the first Mario Bros up to the newest all amazingly well designed games. But am i a fan? Not necessarily.And you need to be one to really enjoy this movie. While a flimsy excuse for a plot is enough for a game, for a full movie that's a though sell. Here the enjoyment consist almost entirely out of watching familiar characters, scenes, actions, jokes and environments. Bowser threatens the mushroom kingdom and our heroes need to save it - That's all the story you get.The How isn't really that important. You need not to care, nothing happens for a reason. The sceenplay appears to be written by a 4-year old: ""And then bowser attacks. And then Mario jumps on a block. And then Princess Peach rides a motorcycle..."" Which is fine for a movie for kids some might say, but there are great screenplays for kids movies, so this is a lame excuse.The actors all do a fine job. Chris Pratt does a surprisingly good Mario voice, Keegan-Michael Key is probably my favorite as Toad and Jack Black is a solid Bowser, only singing Bowser obviously sounds like Jack Black again. Just Seth Rogen took me out of the experience making Donkey Kong sound like himself.All in all this movie does what's expected by a Mario movie, but not a cent more. Unless you're a huge fan, this isn't a cinema experience. Wait for the stream release.","

"GusherPop","20 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros Movie is a frantic Easter egg hunt of a film that does the bare minimum to please its loyal existing fanbase. It features musical motifs from beloved games, minor characters, and nods to the Mario legacy. However, those less enthralled by the antics of the moustachioed Italian plumber will wonder which of Donkey Kong's weaponised barrels this joyless, noisy mess was scrapped from. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is an absolute blast. It doesn't take itself too seriously and pokes fun at itself constantly, which works wonders within the world of the film. The role of Bowser in the film is the role Jack Black was born to play, and the song ""Peaches"" has been stuck in my head since the moment I heard it. The animators did a fantastic job of making Bowser expressive and more human than I've ever seen him, and Jack Black's Bowser is probably my personal favorite part of the entire film. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was praised for its appreciation of the source materials, which included thousands of games made based on the one character. The music alone was spot-on for every little Mario reference, and the one critique was the lack of original voice actors from the Mario games. There was only one voice actor from any of the myriad of Mario games and characters featured in the movie, and the creative team could've done more to show their respect to the original voice actors. However, it is understandable that there are a lot of moving parts that go into making a film, and you can't please every fan with each minute request. I hope going forward in the franchise they will make an effort to implement original character voices more often. This film is a collection of visual and character references cobbled together to form a 92-minute movie. It got me thinking about the fun spin-offs that could exist, like a ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" version of the ""Mario Kart"" sequence or a version that unpacks like ""The LEGO Movie"". The voice work is uniformly mediocre, with Chris Pratt and Charlie Day being the only two actors who have an expressive voice. Seth Rogen is always a welcome presence, and he at least seems to be having some fun. The nostalgia craze and power of Nintendo and Illumination have led to the success of ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" which is expected to lead to a sequel. Critics vs. Fans are both sides of the debate, and I want a world where people don't take fandom for granted. I suspect we will get a lot of films from the NES universe, including ""Donkey Kong Country"" and ""The Legend of Zelda"". Creators need to see these games as foundations on which new ideas can be built, and that's what the '80s kid who dreamed of Mario deserves.","

"jeremycrimsonfox","8 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a long time coming, as it has been nearly thirty years since the Super Mario Bros. Live action films starring the late Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper left a bad taste in the mouths of critics and fans to the point where Nintendo was wary of licensing its IPs to film studios. This movie, which is a lot closer to the source material, is a good movie that focuses on the fans of the Mario franchise.And by that, I mean it makes sure the film is for the fans. Almost every scene is filled with references to Mario game or cartoon or even other games from Nintendo, from screenshots to gameplay footage to even characters. Now, the story for this film basically sets this movie in its own continuity, as Mario and Luigi in this film are plumbers from Brooklyn, similar to their origin in the Super Mario Bros. Super Show. However, when trying to save the neighborhood after a pipe busts open, the two find a pipe and are separated. With Luigi now a prisoner of Bowser in his Dark Lands, Mario must team up with Princess Peach, the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom, and Toad, to stop Bowser, who has claimed the Super Star in order to get Peach to marry him.The voice acting is amazing. Chris Pratt does a good job as the voice of Mario, and Jack Black is excellent for the voice of Bowser. For other cast members, we have Seth Rogan as the voice of Donkey Kong, Charlie Day as the voice of Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as the voice of Peach, and Keegan Michael-Key as the voice of Toad, who all do a good job with these beloved characters (especially Anya as Peach, who in this film, is a strong character who is not about to be the damsel in distress). Other characters appearing include Spike, the foreman who originated from the NES game Wrecking Crew, another game Mario and Luigi appeared in, Cranky Kong, the ruler of the Kongs and DK's father (compared to the games, where DK is Cranky's grandson), and Lumalee, a Luma who has been imprisoned for so long, the poor thing has lost its mind.The story and animation is good. With Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator (a.k.a. Father) of Mario and Luigi, as one of the two producers, the movie completes it aim with being as faithful to the video games that serve as its source material as possible while adding in some new lore. The power-ups are here, and are as faithful as they are in the games, and the soundtrack is a nice remix of songs from the games (although I have to remove a star for some questionable licensed songs, as I don't usually think of Beastie Boys when I think of Mario and Luigi rushing to a plumbing job, although I now want to play AC/DC if I ever play Mario Kart). This is a great film that caters to the fans, as it is loaded with action, adventure, and comedy for Mario fans of all ages.","

"bradykitchen-33648","8 April 2023","Going into this movie I had my doubts as did most people and although I don't think this is a great movie I don't think is inherently bad either.When the film really leans into the nostalgic aspects such the environment and sound it is phenomenal and any Nintendo fan will be throughly impressed by what they accomplished.I know there was a lot of worry about the voice cast and I had the same feeling when the first trailer was shown but the closer we got to the release the less worried I was because I gained an understanding. In every Mario game the dialogue is very minimal, of course you have your classic voice lines like ""it's a me Mario"" or ""wahoo"" but that's about it. So for them to try and mimic that exaggerated voice into full blown dialogue would've been bad. To me the voice cast was excellent and in fact when the time is right and Mario is delivering a classic voice line Pratt does a very good impression.One issue I did have though was their handling of Bowser. Jack Black was excellent and some of what they did with the character was comical but as a whole Bowser was very much geared towards the target audience which was kids. This is a kids movie through and through so for me someone who wanted to see a dominating Bowser it was somewhat disappointing but I completely understand why they chose the direction they did.My biggest issues with the movie are mainly to do with the movie making aspect as a whole rather then their tribute to the games. I feel like the film needed an extra 15-20 minutes, there were certain plot points that weren't explored or explained and it felt lacking in some areas. My other issue is the use of music that was not Mario related, it takes you out of the world when all of a sudden thunderstruck starts playing.Overall I'm impressed and feel that they did a great job with bringing a childhood classic to life but I do feel that certain movie making aspects could've been handled better.B.","

ALL THE VOICES USED IN THIS ARE AWFUL EXCEPT FOR JACK BLACK'S BOWSER. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS GARBAGE. THIS MOVIE IS JUST A TRIBUTE TO THE MARIO VIDEO GAMES AND NOT MUCH OF A MOVIE AT ALL. JUST A CASH GRABBER. ILLUMINATION CAN PUT OUT ANYTHING NOW AND PEOPLE WILL GO SEE IT NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS. AND ILLUMINATION HASN'T PUT OUT ANYTHING GOOD SINCE THE VERY FIRST MINIONS MOVIE. ILLUMINATION DOESN'T EVEN FEEL THE NEED TO DEVELOP CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW EVERYONE KNOWS THE CHARACTERS FROM THE VIDEO GAMES, BUT THAT JUST PROVES EVEN MORE THAT THIS MOVIE IS MORE LIKE A TRIBUTE TO THE VIDEO GAMES THAN A MOVIE, AND IF IT WERE MAKING A TRIBUTE THEY SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST GOT THE VOICES RIGHT, PRINCESS PEACH IS AWFUL AND SO ARE LUIGI AND MARIO, BOWSER SOUNDS OK, BUT EVEN HE ISN'T QUIT RIGHT EITHER.","

"AvatarAryk","10 April 2023","This new Super Mario movie has been highly anticipated by fans of the beloved Nintendo game franchise, but unfortunately, the decision to cast Pratt as the voice of Mario has resulted in a major misstep that seriously detracted from the overall quality of the film.Pratt's lack of experience as a voice actor was immediately apparent showing in his subpar performance, and his attempt to portray the iconic character fell flat. Not only did he fail to capture the charm and personality of the character, but his voice simply did not match the image of Mario that fans have come to know and love. It's disappointing, to say the least, that Pratt made no effort to emulate Mario's iconic voice, instead sounding like his usual Chris Pratt self throughout the entire film.To add insult to injury, the decision to cast Pratt over the original and much-beloved voice actor of Mario, Charles Martinet, was a grave mistake because of how Martinet's voice has become synonymous with the character, so his absence was undoubtedly felt throughout the entire film.While the film itself had its moments, the poor casting decision regarding the voice of Mario was simply too much to overlook. To say I was left feeling disappointed and robbed of the nostalgia factor I had been hoping for is putting it lightly.Overall, the Super Mario movie was a missed opportunity to pay homage to the original game and its loyal fanbase. Had Nintendo chosen to cast Martinet as Mario, the film may have been able to capture the magic of the game and deliver a truly memorable experience for both new and old fans alike.","

"yeswestan","25 August 2023","I am a huge Mario fan. I grew up with this franchise. So here are the positives and negatives.This movie had great animation. I loved the scenes with Mario and Luigi's family, I thought the jokes were fine, the film is littered with excellent references and motifs from the franchise, and performances by Jack Black and Charlie Day honestly carried the film.Unfortunately this movie had sort of weird pacing and very unnatural dialogue. I think only half the voice actors really gave the roles their all. Luigi was side-lined for basically the whole movie. The conclusion felt rushed, and the lack of Mario/Peach romance was unusual considering the general plot of Mario games. I think the great performance by and jokes written for Jack Black backfired by making him...almost too funny to be an intimidating villain? But he killed this role.Honestly I thought this movie was super fun and entertaining, but it was a lot more flawed than I had anticipated. It offers little for critics. It was great for Mario fans though, with the musical motifs, references, and environments, it really felt like they incorporated the gameplay and world of Mario into this film quite nicely.I really loved Mario and Luigi's relationship, so it was really sad to see Luigi was caged for like 50% of the movie. It would have been nice to see more scenes of him interacting with Bowser in captivity. But overall this movie was fun and cute. I enjoyed it.","

"Elvis-Del-Valle","12 April 2023","The animation production company Illumination has reached its maximum level with this spectacular film from the Mario Bros. Universe. It is a wonderful film that perfectly portrays the world of Mario video games. It has many of these elements, among which are the characters, the villains commanded by Bowser and the iconic traps of the classic game. A magnificent visually stunning experience where you can finally see Mario and Luigi come to life. Princess Peach manages to have a very good participation and an excellent development as Mario's partner in the fight against Bowser. They even managed to bring Donkey Kong to life in spectacular fashion. The animation is a visual delight that perfectly replicates the Mario universe with its extraordinary digital effects. The soundtrack even manages to bring the film to life, containing the musical themes of the original video game and accompanied by songs from the eighties that awaken the nostalgia of those who grew up with the first Mario games. It is a fun adventure to enjoy with the family and a fairly faithful adaptation of the original material. Of all the adaptations that have been made of video games, this Mario movie is definitely the best adaptation of all. Among several attempts that have been made to adapt popular video games, this film managed to do the impossible and is to become the best adaptation in the world with great fidelity to the original material. A movie that is really worth watching and enjoying. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.","

That could not be any further from the truth as this movie was entertaining from start to finish. I think the movie critics were taking this movie way serious then needed. Anyone who is a fan of the Mario game franchise will enjoy this film as it has fan service sprinkled throughout. The plot is pretty solid and the movie flys by with a short run time. Remember this movie is not trying to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture but instead is geared toward kids. I kind of compare it to how Star Wars The Force Awakens was when it released a few years back. Chris Pratt and the rest of the voice cast do solid work here. Jack Black as Bowser is perfect casting. With the huge Box Office success that this film was, I'm pretty sure a sequel will be green lit soon. This movie was an 8 out of 10 for me.","

"demonblade-37792","9 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie is about how Mario and Luigi stumble across Mushroom Kingdom. In Mushroom Kingdom, they meet Princess Peach and Toad to join forces to stop Bowser from destroying the Kingdom and marrying Peach. They even have help from Donkey Kong and his Kong Kingdom to stop Bowser and his kingdom once and for all. It is the most animated cinematic Mario movie that you can watch that were created from the video games.Overall, I thought it was great from its voice acting, entertainment, Easter eggs, and the story. Never would I have thought that Chris Pratt would have voiced Mario in a great job. The rest of the cast members such as Anna Taylor Joy as Peach and Jack Black as Bowser did great jobs as well. The animation and visual art style made it so vibrantly enjoyable. They were so many Easter eggs referenced from other Nintendo and Mario games that you have to see it for yourself. I would recommend The Super Mario Bros. Movie in theaters because I am going to watch it for a second viewing!","

"hfreinoso","16 April 2023","The Super Mario movie was, in fact, the most enjoyable moment I ever had in a theater experiment. I was smiling throughout the entire movie because they showed references that I know throughout my entire life when playing Super Mario. I played the Super Mario video games when I was a kid as there was an arcade game with that system. As a fan of the Mario games, I can guarantee this film is for the fans of Nintendo and Super Mario. I enjoyed every single minute of this film and I know, for a fact, this film dealt with better fan service than No Way Home. As it didn't have such awkward pauses, for us the audience to react. The soundtrack, is *French kiss* beautiful. And because of that it was a huge plus for me in the movie. Visually it looks stunning, as Illumination did an exceptional job with this film. I was worried that they would screw this movie up from the get go, but I was wrong. This was the best movie they ever produced. And I knew, with Nintendo along in the helm, they would do a better job than others would easily. The voice acting, in my honest opinion, wasn't bad at all. Yes, even Chris Pratt did a good job doing the voice of Mario. Charlie Day as Luigi was good, Ana-Taylor Joy was great as Peach, Keegan Michael Key as Toad was astounding, and especially Jack Black, who was the best part of this movie as Bowser. (Especially when sung Peaches, that song is still stuck in my head.) However, for me, the only miscast was Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, he was an absolute miscast, and despite that, I dealt with the voice, and got over it. This film, it's not perfect, the story was mid at best and the pacing was way too fast we could spend a few minutes on stuff like Mario's family and the time being in another world. And I wanted the brother duo of Mario and Luigi, and I wish we could get more of that duo, but like I said it was short and I wanted the family side of them more often. But overall, the film was astounding, I had the biggest smile on my face throughout the entire film. As a movie, it was fine, but this movie was made for Nintendo and Mario fans and it does get a 10/10. I recommend you watch this film if you're a huge fan.","

The Final battle, karting scenes and enemies to teamwork with mario & donkey Kong was just perfect.

Everything from start to end, I'm speechless. Go watch this movie if you haven't already, it'll be worth it and you won't even realise.

"dancing_warrior_prophet","20 April 2023","Quite frankly I understand this is not a movie that will be universally adored. This is a medium for fan service.If you haven't played and loved at least a few mario and donkey kong games this movie will probably still be a fine, if unexciting movie. The action is swift, the attitudes are upbeat and if you like imagination this movie has distilled the creativity of decades of games into a single experience. If the only reason you are watching this is because you went with someone else you can still enjoy the movie. For the non-video game fans I would put the movie at a 7, well made and does nothing badly but certainly not a timeless masterpiece.If you are or ever have been a fan of mario in all his iterations and also the Donkey Kong franchise this movie is wonderful, the references to game after game just add to the joy in this movie, this is an origin story for mario that is told well and makes about as much sense as you can hope for. There are power ups and enough game like visuals to make this a treat to watch. Depending on who you are the nintendo fan service ups the value of this movie by 1-3 points, for me this is a 9/10 and I hope a sequel will be made.","

I was in danger of falling asleep.Jack Black's musical contribution was my personal low point. I've never found Black funny and nothing changed here. Painful stuff.Production values were high, voice work polished, no expense was spared on the licenced music, but there were no memorable original songs or scores. Given all this, the script could and should have received far more attention.Comparing it to Pratt's previous major animated franchise, The Lego Movie, a fine example of the genre that worked for all ages, this was something else - joyless and boring.","

"jp_91","28 April 2023","""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a production full of fanservice and nostalgia, bringing in its script the most emblematic moments of video games but offering a flat, almost non-existent story. The computer generated animation is good and simulates that of a video game but as a cinematographic animation it fails to convince. The classic video game soundtrack is present, the character designs are faithful to those that have been shown for decades, and the director's work is decent without being fabulous. The edition does not manage to be novel at all and the final result is that of an episode of some television series focused only on entertaining. A movie with funny moments but without much technical quality.","

Nintendo would've vetted every part of the film of course but I'm amazed they signed off this version, full of lazy humour and typical Hollywood repartee, plus the occasional reference to the game now and then as if they'd forgotten they needed to reflect it (as an after thought).Anyway the modern kids will probably like it I'm sure but as someone who loved the NES and SNES versions of the game it's not for me, nor will the likely countless sequels be as the Americans squeeze every bit of money out of yet another franchise!","

It has felt like lately they have relied heavily on past success to bolster a current movie. So I was very apprehensive about going to this movie. But I am glad I went! It was the perfect blend of nostalgia and newness. The soundtrack had hints of music you find in the games and even the way Mario moved and fought had nods to the game. But it was done in a nonchalant way that made me smile. It wasn't forced down your throat compared to some other movies that are trying to rely on nostalgia. The storyline was simple and not overtly complex. Some might find that annoying, but I found it perfectly performed. The writing wasn't cringy either. I was also worried about Chris Peart voicing Mario, but I think it turned out well. Jack black was great as bowser! I would recommend this!","

I don't mind the opening and the brothers being sucked into the dimension portal, but once through, the world and characters are very simple black and white, despite the multitude of colour on the screen. Random power-ups turning the odds, has no value either. The music wasn't really applicable and pretty generic, the Beastie Boys a good choice though. The non-animation film in '93 is better, heh.","

Some moments are absolutely hilarious, I haven't laughed so much at the screen for ages, story is compelling and never boring, not a second is wasted on useless scenes, self indulgence or neglecting the audience. Finally a movie which is written for the pure enjoyment of the audience rather to aggrandise the writers/ producers/ directors. There are some moments of greatness ( the caged blue thingy dialogue created an uncontrollable bout of laughter in the audience every time it was on screen), every detail serves a purpose and to increase the level of enjoyment.20 years ago this would be a good normal movie you went to watch to have a good time, unfortunately these days this is the pinnacle of entertainment for better or worse.

"CinemaSerf","13 April 2023","I am not the demographic and to be honest this isn't really a film that I was ever going to like either. The story is beyond simple and the game-based animation - though expertly crafted - did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations, thrill or much sense of adventure. I got the feeling this was really an outing for ""Mario"", ""Luigi"" and ""Peach"" designed to satisfy the die-hard fans, or the children - or both, but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungi-fest. It wouldn't be fair to say this is bland - it's not designed to challenge or take risks: it's fun for those who grew up with ""Mario"" et al in their lives and I'm not going to decry that. It's colourful, pacy, and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it?","

"Nifune","29 January 2024","The culture that symbolizes Japan today is no longer ""samurai"" but ""games. Mario is a prime example.Over 30 years since his infamous live-action movie, this film's sleek 3D-CG is expected to be a great success, but the cruel passage of time has once again cast a dark shadow over its adaptation. Peach was no longer a traditional Western princess at all. Though supposed to be saved, SHE saved Luigi instead of Mario.The confrontation with Donkey and the car chase of Mario Kart are still good enough. Why is Princess Peach playing the role of course instructor? If she can defeat Bowser by herself, the fascinating worldview would be capsized. The depiction of real world was also superfluous by preventing from immersion in the game world.We can say the story is an alteration or even deterioration of the original. The current trend of reinterpreting the past work for the sake of the contemporaneous dominant ideology or mere business needs is also evident in this film.","

It can be fun at times to see nods to games, and see your favorite characters on screen. The movie is cute, charming and will greatly appeal to younger audiences. I had a good time watching the movie overall, but most of the time I was kind of bored. Jack Black stands out in a stacked cast, but otherwise most of the vocal performances are flat. Especially Anya Taylor Joy's and Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong and Princess Peach. While I don't agree with all the harsh criticisms pointed at this movie. I do agree with the sentiment that this is not much of a movie and rather a collection of sequences reference Mario Games.

"eve_dolluk","9 April 2023","Knowing your audience is what this film has going for it. Mario has a huge following everywhere in the world, the film does not need to attract a new audience to be a success.I remember 30 years ago going to watch THAT Mario film and coming out of the cinema a baffled and confused teenager.Back then my reference point was the Super mario games on the Nes and Snes including Mario Cart. Obviously the plot of these games could be written on napkin but my imagination was bigger tham a napkin, the games just fed my imagination.This is something this film does well, it is aimed at fans of the games and kids, it includes lots of easter eggs and fan homage while also putting you in the world of Mario and Luigi, from New York beginnings to his adventures in the Mushroom Kingdom. Essentially, that is, the story of Mario and Luigi after thousands of hours of gameplay.Its simple its fun and there are plenty of weird and wonderful characters along the way. Thats what the games are and thats what the film is. If you are an adult who did not have an interest in the games then you are a minority who will probably not enjoy the film.I think the last mario game I had played was Mario 64 so its been a while but my memory of the games was enough to make this film very enjoyable and fun to watch. The visuals, sound and world building are brilliant but at the same time very 'Mario'.So what if you hated the Mario games ? What will you take or enjoy about this new film ? I should imagine very little except a headache.. maybe....What if you don't mind the Mario games or never played them, well for both adults and kids this is a bit of cartoon fun.If you love the games you will love this film just don't expect the film to reveal some sort of hidden meaning or divine inspiration.8/10.","

"I_Ailurophile","9 August 2023","Despite strong word of mouth and trusted recommendations, and a promising advance teaser, I'd be lying if I said I weren't still skeptical. I don't even refer to the long, sad history of movies based on videogames; I earnestly have a soft spot for Bob Hoskins, and for the 1993 Mario movie he starred in with John Leguizamo. Rather, it was a friend who first remarked that the casting, when it was announced, looked like the product of a questionable meme generator. And even setting that aside, I plainly had doubts about how an animated full-length feature, keeping intact the familiar appearances of characters and environments from Nintendo's beloved franchise, could successfully appeal to both kids and adults, gamers and non-gamers, and weave in recognizable elements while also telling a wholly original story, for that was the task laid before 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie.' Well, now that I'm very belatedly watching for myself, I'll say this: the animation is absolutely top-notch, a tremendous credit to both Illumination and Nintendo. And while I'm not going to sit here and say that it's perfect, I'm delighted at how smart and clever the writing mostly is. Hoskins will always be my Mario Mario (and Lou Albano a runner-up), but it turns out that this 2023 movie really is a whole lot of fun, and something that I'm fairly certain most anyone could enjoy.While I had my doubts, screenwriter Matthew Fogel penned a screenplay that really does manage to pretty much do it all. The question, to be honest, is one of balance, and to a smaller extent one of mindfulness, for the writing is the linchpin - SMBM's greatest strength, but also its liability. A complete, cohesive story is told, and all throughout are scattered jokes, references, and gags that should find favor with even the most casual and general of audiences. Fogel adeptly shifts the action to environments mirroring well-known levels from the many sundry videogames in which our plucky protagonist and the related characters have appeared, and the movement feels reasonably fluid and natural. This is to say nothing of the extreme abundance of jokes, references, gags, sound effects and music cues, themes in the score, creatures, items, and otherwise inclusions that pointedly evoke Nintendo's vast library of games, nods that only those with experience as players would appreciate, even down to scenes that reflect the platforming ethos that dominates the game franchise. With this said, one way or another some facets herein do feel decidedly forced, including even early exposition in ""the real world,"" and the infusion of licensed songs all too easily go from fun to overbearing. Other bits are entirely too on the nose, working so hard to throw in an idea from still another game that they feel a bit self-indulgent. And for all the intelligence that characterizes the narrative and scene writing, there's nonetheless an argument to be made that too much of the entertainment in the picture comes from the pandering odds and ends that cater to nostalgia for anyone with even baseline knowledge of Nintendo's pixelated or polygonal creations. As much as this is a fun animated adventure, it's an unabashed love letter to Shigeru Miyamoto's acolytes first and foremost.Still, one could genuinely, endlessly dispute the finer points of the value - narrow catering versus broad appeal, and how appropriate or excessive the references are. Ultimately SMBM only wanted to provide a good time, and I think it achieves that goal most ably. The plot is engaging and compelling, with boundless humor and a pure intent of a fantastical, heroic romp. I'm so very pleased with how Fogel subverts tiresome convention and allows Peach to be a powerful, capable person in her own right; there's also sagacity in how Bowser is written as a destructive figure with a sense of entitlement to what he desires. While I take issue in part with the casting, I can't say the actors didn't do a fantastic job in breathing life into their 3D counterparts. Even more than the others, Charlie Day is an unexpected delight as Luigi, giving the taller brother an energy far exceeding his diminutive sibling. One might wonder if Jack Black has ever felt as much joy as he did in voicing Bowser; it's a fabulous bonus that we get to hear the other, equally famous side of Black's repertoire in these ninety-odd minutes. While Brian Tyler's compositions lean ponderously on the work of Koji Kondo to flesh out the music that tickles our ears, I'm happy all the same with how the score here helps world-famous videogame music to feel newly refreshed with a slightly different spin. And it bears repeating that the artists at Illumination turned in a full-length feature that benefits from some of the best animation I've seen to date; for as much as the medium has grown in recent years, often with a bent toward realism, the undeniably cartoonish fancy of this film is utterly impeccable in a way that even mega-million ""live-action"" titles, flush with gaudy digital effects and backgrounds, struggle to match.I wonder if it was even possible for this to be completely perfect; no matter which direction Fogel tended, toward the unknowing viewer or the videogame fan, I think flawless balance for a project like this is beyond anyone's reach. Just how overboard this goes in one capacity or another is something that will be debated for a long time to come by those with a propensity for pedantry (like me). More than that, it may honestly be reflected upon by Miyamoto, the creatives at Nintendo, and other filmmakers and game developers for a long time to come as there will inevitably come further pursuit of adapting ever more games to the cinematic medium. Yet when all is said and done, the fact remains that 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is a success in all the ways it wanted to be, enjoyable in one measure or another by any but the most stubborn of cinephiles. Speaking as someone who was maybe even a little resistant to the very concept, I can definitely say I liked this, and I'm hard-pressed to think of anyone who wouldn't. I'd not go so far as to say it's a total must-see, save perhaps for diehard devotees of This Or That, but even if it's not without faults I'm overall delighted at just how good SMBM is. As far as I'm concerned this is well worth checking out, and a fine credit to all involved.","

I've played this game so many times for so long. I remember all the soundtracks too. I'd always play it with my cousins (I still do xD)So how is this movie?You know, this movie is actually fun enough to not have any substance at all. It's just a plain, fun, moderate adventure which was funny, nostalgic and visually stunning. And if you grew up playing games with these characters, you're going to enjoy it even more. This is a movie where I don't need to think about anything, just sit back and enjoy the ride. I like myself a movie like this every once in a while. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously either. I mean there's this lame running joke (but admittedly funny :/), that just showed how stupid the villain of this movie is. That just proves that it wasn't taking itself seriously at all.I liked the song choices too, the songs made this movie even more fun. There are many references to the games. Even the score's pretty cool, mixing the game soundtracks throughout the movie. The voice acting was nice all around. Btw, Princess Peach was just so savage in this movie, I loved it. Donkey Kong and Toad were fun too. The humour was actually pretty nice.Now to THAT ONE SCENE. There's like a 10 min sequence that's entirely denoted to Mariokart. I absolutely adored that entire sequence. The way it starts with all the teasing and build up, with a great song too, I just got goosebumps. Yeah, I'm probably going to rewatch that entire scene many more times. (I felt so blessed to see the RAINBOW ROAD on the big screen)This movie starts off slow though, and tries to end a little too dramatically, which didn't really work. But I had lots of fun with this movie. I'm going to rewatch it again once it reaches an OTT platform. Obviously it's not as good as some of the other entries this year.But enjoy this movie for what it is, a mindless yet nostalgic fun ride. The runtime of just 90 minutes actually proves that this movie isn't trying to be anything more than what it is.","

"ryanpersaud-59415","15 August 2023","I saw The Super Mario Bros. Movie on Friday and...genuinely forgot that I saw it by Tuesday.If that doesn't say everything about this movie, I don't know what does. Super Mario Bros. Is fun, light hearted, and extremely simple. It's for kids and it doesn't let you forget that. That doesn't mean it's a ""bad"" movie; one thing I loved was how beautiful the animation was.Weirdly, this film excelled at textures; everything from Mario's clothes to Bowser's scales to Donkey Kong's fur looked tangible. It often felt like seeing toys come to life on screen.To be realistic, it's not hard when your bringing Nintendo's iconic and timeless character and set designs to life. Illumination got it extremely easy. (By the way, the top review on this site claims it's their ""best"" film...which, wow, low bar). The plot, the characters, the look of the movie were essentially all done for the studio, so I really don't give them credit here.Where a deliberate production choice was made was in the voice acting. Oh man. If there's one thing I genuinely hated about this movie, it's Chris Pratt's Mario and Anya Taylor Joy's Peach. The Mario characters aren't ""characters"" as movies, TV, or comics would describe them. They don't have well known character traits, so when you rip one of the most ICONIC aspects of them away - their voices - it sometimes doesn't feel like it's really ""Mario"" or ""Peach"" I'm seeing. That Charles Martinet is actually in the film feels like an insult.Jack Black's Bowser and Keegan Michael Key's Toad did work for me though. I thought they were the least offensive; Toad's video game voice is objectively grating, so I think Key did a good job with it. I just don't get why Mario or Peach couldn't retain the spirit of their original voices though. Same with Luigi and Donkey Kong. This could've worked with some creativity.And yes, the plot is SERIOUSLY lacking in that. It's perhaps the most predictable, paint-by-numbers story I have ever seen. The action can be quite fun, dynamic, and interesting though, so when the movie gets going it's fun. I mean, again, Mario's mechanics and action are legendary at this point, so it's not particularly hard to turn that into an animated film.And YES, I loved the references, as a lifelong Mario fan, I can't help myself. This is a fun movie, but it's one that exits your memory within a day or two, there's no need to see it again, and there's no creativity. It's fine, but a bit disappointing. And let's just say, I'm happy Barbie - a movie that takes a product intended for kids and actually does something interesting - will overtake it as the highest grossing film of the year. A much worthier title.","

"crunchwraptaco","6 April 2023","I was looking forward to seeing Mario again on the big screen but this movie can't seem to find the direction it wants to go in. Save your money and send it to the makers of this film because they're going to need it after this. Seems like that movie lacks cohesiveness as they tend to throw everything at you in hopes of having something stick on. Take your kids or your friends out for a meal instead of this mess. Mario will alwaya be a great game even if Hollywood manages to butcher the movie. We can't all be winners but in this case they only winners are the people that don't watch Mario in theaters.","

"eddie_baggins","1 May 2023","It really should do anything but, but unfortunately the newest big screen adventure of the Super Mario Brothers makes me sad.It's better (if less schlocky entertaining) than the renowned terrible experience that was the 1993 live action iteration of Nintendo's iconic characters but I am unshakably forlorn about what this prime example of a studio and its backers/partners reaching for the lowest hanging fruit means for the future of family entertainment and Hollywood blockbusters aimed squarely at the easy to please and most vulnerable, as the billion plus dollar success and unbelievable (if also somewhat predictable) praise from common audiences surely means we are set for more generic and easy to digest properties such as this in the near future.Perhaps it's because I'm a nearly middle aged grump or perhaps I am just a bad person? But despite growing up surrounded by the joyous world of Mario and the wider Nintendo brand I expected more from this affair handled by Despicable Me studio Illumination Studios and while I understand this is not a film for adults, although Nintendo fans are one of the rarest breed of fans that seem incapable of disliking anything their beloved company does or associates itself with, Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic, Pierre Leduc and Fabien Polack's feature is a tiresome exercise of well trodden paths that is neither witty enough, charming enough or magical enough to be considered a fun family ride even if many, high off the sugar like rush of the 90 minute film, will claim otherwise.The film itself certainly looks great and feels like a Mario world come to life with vibrant colors, crazy characters and more than its fair share of winks/Easter eggs to the properties past and present but outside of the colorful world in which we find the Chris Pratt voiced Mario and Charlie Day voiced Luigi we find nothing to write home about in a comedic sense or magic sense as we are instead treated to a film more intent on selling its audience more games or merchandise than creating something wholesome or memorable.Quality family entertainment on both cinema screens and streaming services is a dime a dozen these days in a saturated market that is more focused on quantity over quality, with even Pixar losing its way over recent years with a series of so-so and forced exercises and no one ever expected a modern day take on a feature length Mario film to break new narrative ground or try and reinvent the wheel that is so easy to turn for studios with an endless budget and beloved property but unlike its namesake in a game sense, this Mario is bereft of whimsy, wonder and Wario and one can't help but feel as though once the rainbow road shine has worn off, this is a film that will be rarely spoken about or appreciated outside of the fact it hoodwinked the box office across the globe.As far as wins go, Jack Black makes for a fun if underused big bad in the form of Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach makes for a far more well-rounded figure than the Princess we use to see in the most renowned of Mario games but really none of this matters a whole lot as The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a prime example of where Hollywood still goes wrong, trying so little yet becoming such a success, setting in motion a sad turning wheel that means audiences will continue too lap up products that they should be demanding more from, regardless of target audience or perceived aims.Final Say -Nintendo fans will love it (like they do anything brand associated) and kids are going to believe they had a far better time than they in fact did in the long run but The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a charmless exercise in a low-ball feature film event that makes me sad for the future of other such properties we are now likely to see bought to life in a similar way.1 1/2 depressive Lumalee's out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"Hansuser","6 April 2023","I went today with my son and it really sucked. Not funny at all. Flat story and characters. Also the whole thing just felt all really forced like: this and that has to be shown but we dont really know what to do with it. They just dont have anything to offer because this whole super mario universe and the simple characters that are part of it only work in the games and thats what they are made for anyways. I dont like the new look of mario and luigi either with the shiny big eyes. Kinda made me sick. Also weird and dumb they made mario hate mushrooms when he always chills with them and eats them. Only nice part was the beginning in brooklyn with the plumming and their family. I do always liked the games and played most of them. Overal i dont get why they needed to make this. If you dont have good ideas or even only bad ones like it was the case here just dont do it. A movie wasnt necessary at all the games did great and mario just doesnt have movie potential. I hope i can forget this movie so i can continue to enjoy the mario game franchise with my son.","

This is made for two - six year olds to keep them occupied while the parents have a date night or something.What an absolute waste of money and time.The refusal of hiring voice actors is ridiculous. The stereotypical Brooklyn Mario brothers Italian family with disappointed father was just dumb.The whole movie can be summed up as just dumb.Jack Black couldn't even save this film. The hype is outrageous. Go see something better, like the back of your eyelids when you take a nap.","

"Chi-C-Dawg","27 April 2023","I'm perplexed by the high scores on here as this film really fell flat in the story department. There is not one surprise, line of note, or every real hole in this movie. A lot of the lines felt like they were placeholders in the original draft for later insertion (see: ""and that is how you princess!""). It was really surprising. It all just feels very basic and not organic at all. Very cliche even. The plot itself is fine but holds no surprises and they even tell you everything that is going to happen before it does. It's very paint by the numbers.That being said the action sequences look terrific and the ""gaming"" parts are enjoyable. It's just a shame that they have all of these comedic actors providing voice work and there's no real comedy in the script to lift the story. It's all feel very flat. The one exception is the existential crisis blue star/Kirby figure in the prison who has some bizarrely dark lines. I wasn't against it but compared with how mundane the rest of the script was, it felt out of place. Overall it looks great, but unfortunately the story is VERY bland.","

"masonfisk","25 May 2023","For those of you who were awaiting a proper big screen adventure for our pixelated plumbers, they finally reach your local multiplex (or living room since it's streaming already). As the monstrous Bowser has invaded & conquered a kingdom at the film's onset & Princess Peach's realm is next on the menu, in comes Mario & brother Luigi who through a portal in the sewers are transpo'd into the land of mushrooms where they get a crash course on the lay of the land & have to step up to defeat the cruel leader before his plans to wed the Princess comes to fruition. All of this is clearly not meant for me even though I enjoyed the animation during the opening plumbing job assignment but once they enter the 'game' only the most die hard tykes of a certain age will find any of this remotely engaging as most of the Easter eggs will either fall on blind eyes (or in some cases I knew what it was but kind of shrugged at the realization) or be embraced full throttle. I know I'll be a somewhat contrarian critic here but I prefer the 1993 live action version which although a train wreck to be sure still had a whiff of originality in its attempt.","

"thomvic","10 April 2023","I've played majority of main Mario games so I'm well versed in the mario universe. I've a Nintendo game player since I was 5 years old up until this day.So I went into this movie with the mindset - it's a kid's movie just try to enjoy it and enjoy seeing all the Mario references and don't think to much.And the movie doesn't ask you to think to much. The plot is so flat which I guess I should have expected since the games have no plot besides from Princess Peach being kidnapped. What this movie does well though is that Princess Peach isn't a damsell in distress and is more of a character in the movie which I liked.What the movie however gets wrong is that the assumption that by adding all these Mario references like Mario Kart and Smash Brothers, this will make the fans go ' Oooh wow that's so cool!'. Yes it's a nice thing to have , but what the movie doesn't really get into the lore of the Mario world and assumes everyone knows it. But by not building up this world, it kind of feels like Mario just jumps into this world, meets Princess Peach who pretty much teams up with him straight away and off they go to save the kingdom! I think the film could have done a better job of trying to invest the audience into this w1orld. I'm not saying that they have to spend ten minutes explaining every item, but I think they could have like gone through several worlds to get to Bowser, and talk about say the underwater level and the creatures that dwell in it.I can see the little kidsaying this is an amazing movie and people will say oh it's a fun movie and it's a Mario movie for kids - of course there's no plot. Well I guess I'm just a bit older now and even though I like Mario games, this movie is really just a Mario movie with references and Easter Eggs.","

"Flourduck","26 September 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie is an entertaining and light-hearted film that makes for an enjoyable watch. It is filled with humour and incorporates a lot of things known from the Super Mario game series. This is sometimes done with an ironic approach, which is welcome.Parts of the film might be overly silly, and not all of the jokes land completely. Also, the plot develops a little fast, which feels a bit rushed at times. Still, this is a movie aimed at kids after all, so one shouldn't expect much more.Being familiar with Super Mario games, all of the references to different games, characters and soundtracks was very enjoyable. People that are not familiar with the games will miss out on this, which in my opinion makes up a big portion of the movie. Being a Super Mario fan will surely enhance the experience.All in all, an enjoyable and fun film.","

"mjtothemax3","5 April 2023","After seeing the trailers I shockingly had somewhat high expectations that this movie was going to rock through and through and at times that maybe the case but this is a heartless spectacle of a film. Target audience will clearly be more focused towards younger children rather than general audience or in fact any type of gamer older then the age of 13. Is there some nostalgic moments obviously but I can't help but think how much of a wasted opportunity this film truly was considering the voice talent the visuals and the gameplay they had to use for inspiration for it's just feel completely heartless in the end. Who would have thought Sonic was better than this turned out to be??!","

Unfortunately it delivers mostly on animation quality and amount of fan service, while the story, jokes and general writing are average at best, but mostly predictable and actually quite boring.My 5yo loved it, but even he could barely recall any of the movie by the next day, whereas the classics (pixar, disney, other illumination selections) he can recall and quote them for days after!In summary - Great for a quick watch for the kids, a bit meh for the adults, won't stick in your mind.","

"ayoreinf","10 April 2023","As stated at my title - I'm not the target audience of this movie. Let's start with the fact that I'm old enough to have seen the live action version of the early nineties, the one everybody loved to hate. To tell you the truth - I didn't hate it back then, I still think it's a very underrated movie with some top-notch acting performances. On the other hand, I'm far from blown away by this version. There're too many plot holes for my taste, and too many things that happen because the script writers needed them to happen but were too lazy to develop a plot line that would justify them. I do think that the voice acting was very high quality, but I found the facial design of some characters to be too doll like (mainly the princess). And I do love silly goofy animation, but I don't think that this is ""Illumination's best since Despicable Me 1"". As another reviewer claimed. In fact I think all of the Despicable/Minions franchise is much better and much funnier than this movie, even if some jokes did hit the mark.Bottom line, this movie, which I find mediocre, at best, is getting rave reviews while the older, cuter version of the early nineties is still considered a disaster by many who never saw it. Personally, I think the plot in this movie was underdeveloped, and even lazy, while the older movie, which obviously called for suspension of disbelief, like all fantasy movie do, had much better plot development. It was not perfect, but it was cute and even charming at moments. Yes, this one has its share of charming moments, but it has way too many moments that didn't make any sense inside the world that was built in the movie. And for me, that's an unforgiveable sin.","

"Alex_Crook","7 April 2023","I think a lot of viewers and lifelong Mario fans are being too forgiving of this film. I obviously didn't expect to be blown away. The trailer looked okay, but ultimately I walked away from the theater pretty disappointed. Some of the easter eggs and callbacks to the games are fun, and the voice actors are fine. That being said, I feel like they wasted so much of the runtime on cheesy jokes, montages, and flashy sequences. They could have spent much more time on creating a stronger story, world building, and character development. It has such a frantic pace, but still feels so empty. It's basically an hour and a half of nostalgia bait, with a bare bones story, and a little bit of backstory. The separation of Mario and Luigi feels off, the ending is incredibly anticlimactic, so much so that I thought for sure it couldn't be the ending. The 80's music feels forced and out of place, and the original score (in my opinion) didn't really feature enough Nintendo sounding music. It definitely just seems like another Illumination movie, and doesn't really live up to the hopes I had for a Mario movie. Maybe they will do more with sequels and spinoffs (since kids movies are basically written to have sequels nowadays) but who knows.","

There's a good variety of environments and characters which are decently engaging.The voice acting is spot on, particularly Anya Taylor Joy and Jack Black, the latter of whom steals the show with a belter of a song.I think the plot is pretty decent too. It isn't groundbreaking or amazing but it is solidly entertaining. All of the main Mario characters are involved, there's Mario and Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong etc. They are all brought to life and worked into the plot pretty neatly.Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this film.

"rorylanelutter","8 April 2023","I need to stop watching licensed movies.During Bower's piano solo, my son turned to me and whispered ""this is so lame"".The story of Mario has always been a bit vague. The backstory of the mushroom kingdom never seemed really that important to the game series and existed more as a setting to facilitate strange and bizarre environments and creatures for Mario to contend with.So, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.""Mario, you know, the story where Mario and Peach team up to save Luigi from Peach's jilted lover, Bowser.""It seemed like the script was essentially a corporate brainstorm for game references, then they arranged the sticky notes into a long list, threw the stack into some scriptwriter's lap, and said ""okay, make a generic kids movie script out of this"".But the result is just this ultra fast-tempo fever dream is more than a bit cringe in a number of places.""For the 45 seconds Donkey Kong and Mario are trapped inside the giant fish, they compare feelings of parental disappointment"" W. T. F.And then, of course, Peach is naturally way better at jumping and everything than Mario, because that's just become mandatory boilerplate.It's just tedious. It's just more Soylent cinema; ""Cloudy with a chance of Lego Minions"" with a Nintendo theme.But, growing up with these characters, I think I liked the movie less than I would have if I knew nothing about them. The joy I got from the references was overshadowed by the annoyance I felt... especially, like every time I saw Bowser. It just wasn't Bowser to me. It looked like Bowser, but the personality was just completely averse to what my mental image of Bowser was like.I don't know what I expected, but I imagined a character obsessed with power who's determined to conquer the mushroom kingdom and is therefore is Peach's enemy. I certainly didn't imagine he was so in love with Peach, fantasizing about the lovely wedding they'll have, that he must conquer the kingdom as a means to fulfill his love. That's just totally.... Not Bower to me.It reminds me of the Lego Batman movies that tried to make cheap comedy at the character's expense. I don't like it.But that's what you get with these. The formula is simple. Purchase the rights to a popular IP, throw in a bunch of fan-service references, add some shallow facade of a character arc, and just assault the audience with so much visual spectacle that the thinking parts of their mind are numbed by the barrage.Eh, might be worth a watch if you're really bored, but not one of the better ways to spend a couple hours.","

"ungirebecca","14 April 2023","Firstly I am going to try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible. It will contain spoilers about who is in the movie but I will try to avoid the main plots of the movie.I have been a gamer since I was very young. I have grown up with Mario and the characters in this world so it's fun to see them in a movie yet again but this time in an animated movie. This movie shows the relationship between brothers as they face adult problems we have all faced as we have gotten older. However, they are lucky enough to find a little magic.The animation in this movie is absolutely stunning. From the lighting to the textures everything is done really nicely. The Mushroom Kingdom is filled with colour but not too overpowering. You are even able to see each of the scales on Bowser's body. It is really outstanding.There are so many easter eggs hidden throughout this movie for old and new fans. My favourite has to be the game cube into tone as the ringtone. I love how it reaches out of the Mario universe and brings in Nintendo easter eggs too. At each part of the movie, you can look in the distance and see something hidden that will make you smile.The music throughout the movie also gets you really immersed in the movie as a lot of the tracks are from the game but remixed to fit the feel of the movie. It's nice to have something so familiar with a new twist.Once we enter the Mushroom Kingdom we are treated to a world filled with life. There are enemies and friendly faces everywhere for Mario to discover along with us. The kingdom itself is filled with toads funning around doing daily activities. We can see the toads shopping for powerups and even travelling in pipes around the kingdom. The power-ups are also a nice look into the different games included. It was also great to see other parts of the world and see how the different characters get around the world like karts. I would love to see more of this in the next movie too!There are so many characters included in this movie and I will speak about some of them below:Mario - I really enjoyed Mario much more in the movie than I thought I would from the trailer. It is explained in the movie why the accent is different from what we all know. I actually loved seeing Mario being the protective big brother we have all grown to love but he also has the ability to grow throughout this movie. It is fun watching Mario explore this new world and learn about how to get around.Luigi - Luigi is the scaredy cat brother as always but still Mario's sidekick through everything. We see how Mario is the one who often gets them into trouble but through thick and thin Luigi will stick by Mario's side. I wish we were able to see more of Luigi. Even in the small amount of time, we see Luigi grow to even protect Mario in the endToad - I really enjoyed that Toad was more like the adventurer Toad as it created a more lovable character. This gave Toad some independence and allowed him to stay by the side of Princess Peach.Peach - Over the years Peach has been given a much more independent feel. In the movie, she is very strong and does not need Mario to come and save her. Peach is actually the one who shows Mario how to survive in this new world. She will do everything in her power to keep the toads safe even if it costs her happiness.DK - Donkey Kong took the direction of being very confident and showboating to the others from his area. It really suited his character and it was nice to see him humbled by Mario. This created a rivalry between the 2 but they also work together and develop a fun friendship.Bowser - What can I say, Jack Black did an amazing job with the voice of Bowser. At first, I really enjoyed how scary Bowser looks to the other from this world. Everyone is scared of Bowser and what he will do with the star. Unfortunately, I really think that throughout the movie his character was written too desperately. We all know that Bowser likes Peach and will do anything to make her his. However, it came across more like jealousy and felt very despite. I think this really took away from Bowser as a character and felt me feeling a little disanointed as some parts were amazing for the character.There are so many fun parts to this movie from the musical number by Bowser to the Mario Kart section with the old favourite Rainbow Road. It has something for the whole family and I would highly recommend a watch.7/10.","

"rafaelcastrogarcia","6 April 2023","I've been playing Mario games since I was a little boy and I have to admit that when I saw this film coming out I had really high hopes for it. But to be honest I felt it was pretty mediocre and the story doesn't feel right... they had a lot of potential to make it work. But I don't know I felt the story was just ok not even average, just ok. I felt it was a watch one time movie. I mean it is entertaining and has its fun moments but I wouldn't watch it again if being honest. If a sequel comes out I hope they explore more the worlds and so on. Cause it had a lot of potential but I'm not sure I felt they could've done more about it.","

As i've been playing the Mario game since i was a kid both in my Nintendo DS and 3DS, I got a well enough knowledge of Mario Bros. To actually get the whole reference in terms of the object and the music, and that's one of the things that i really like about the film, i also quite surprise by the music choosing in the film, good animation, like some of the shot especially the video game perspective angle, and of course the one that people have been most talk about is the voice acting, and i thought everybody did a good job on it, there is a couple of parts that are meh but mostly i'm perfectly fine, my problem is more on the story, it is a straight to the point film which mostly if it's happen in other movie i will absolutely love it, the thing is the story in The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the most basic story that they could ever told for a movie, it is entertaining and fun but in the most basic way possible, couple of exciting and impressive scene and visual inside the most basic story of Hero vs Villain type of story, the comedy wasn't really work, couple of little giggle but there is also a couple of cheesy moment, overall The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a nice little film, flawed but still a pretty good movie with the most basic story to tell.","

"daveplumbzero","13 April 2023","The evil Bowser threatens the peaceful mushroom kingdom, only Mario, the Italian plumber who sounds like Chris Pratt can save the dayThis was amazing for me even as an adult, I was spotting all the game references left right and center (visual items, characters, music). However, I will admit that adults with no prior Mario experience may find the despicable me movies by the same studio better overall. If you see critics giving less than 7/10, still do best to ignore themAlso, people said they didn't like the idea of Chris Pratt as Mario's voice, shortly in you aren't even bothered by it, and the original Mario voice actor is given a cameoShout out to Jack black who nails it, both as Bowser, and as a tenacious d piano moment.","

"Bryangtrujillo","6 April 2023","Although the animation is very colourful and energetic, it has the trademark ""cheapness"" of other Illumination movies.The same could be said about the characters, they are sometimes funny and somewhat charismatic, but in the end they are quite bland.However, the biggest offender is the story. It is very by-the-numbers, delivering no twists and offering almost no surprises. I understand that the main demographic for this movie is kids and young teens, but they deserve better right?The music, score and voice acting are serviceable to good -- but they could be done so much better. The video game references are welcomed however they feel a little tacked on.I wouldn't say I came out of the movie feeling totally disappointed as I actually enjoyed it for the most part.","

"bttnpjfp","8 April 2023","I can't even put in the words how much I adore this movie. This movie is a trip down memory lane. I felt like a kid again. That Christmas when my father bought me Atari 2600 in 1981. I skipped school many time just to play Donkey Kong, I was mario, I saved princess million times and yet never became boring. Now when I am almost turning 50, played all mario games there is, this is what I needed.Movie doesn't waste a second, I love how they included Brooklyn into the movie and it hit me pretty hard because I was actually born in Brooklyn so I became mario ones again. I love the dynamic that mario and Luigi have in this movie i feel same energy that I share with my brother another plus in my book that's for sure.Now let's talk characters more deep, bowser was amazing, strong, powerful turtle same as I rememberer in mario 64 and dont make me start on his singing my god that was so fantastic that's what he was missing all this years one song(one love song) man I love the team behind this movie , kemek old grumpy helper who was particularly funny I was so mad at him in captain toad treasure tracker but here he is amazing, donkey Kong had some pretty interesting story with his father kranky Kong that I don't really remember in original donkey Kong game but nothing the less he was astonishing, princess peach was awesome and so intimidating, and the crown jewel Toad my hero he was everything I ever wanted in a Mario movie he was funny, brave, dumb, quick, fast, smart and everything else.The animation was supremely amazing I just wanted to dive right from my seat straight into the screen I was so impressed by the quality, it was so beautiful. My favorite kingdom was sand kingdom, the dynamics there were so interesting must seeAnd my another crown jewel Charles Martinet I wanted him to be apart of this masterpiece so bad they actually included him and that scene will probably be one of best scenes in movie theaters ever.Movie was peak cinema, loved the music especially the 80s songs they really made everything whole
10/10 we need a sequel.","

"RobTheWatcher","19 August 2023","A fun but forgettable movie that brought Nintendo's classic Super Mario Bros to the big screen. I think the graphics quality was high level and impressive and I felt like I was transported to their world. I think they did a good job capturing that and fitting in as much as they could from the game. But with that, they also forced everything in and it felt crammed and a bit chaotic and rushed. The story line was super lackluster and lacked surprises or complexity. It was just a fun one time watch but one I'll forget about and likely will never have a desire to see again. Still worth the watch for nostalgia alone.","

I had many doubts but I'm so pleased with the outcome as a big fan of Nintendo.Jack Black, Chris Pratt and Keegan. They really put on a great performance.Also princess Peach and DK.I don't know.

"bagelsamazeme","28 April 2023","Wow... What a movie, it reminds me often that Cranky Kong is actually the big monkey in the hit game donkey kong... LOL! I only jest, but anyway, about the movie? Love it... For the wrong reasons!!!! I wouldn't say it's better than finding nemoy 2... But I would! I just love it. Fantastical. But it does have its fair share of bad moments.. I have to critique it harshly for my children. This isn't where credit is due, Cranky Kong? BOORRRING!!!! His actor did not put any effort into the role whatsoever!! I suppose it aligns with the characters personality... Hee hee, but anyway, he's a minor character. Let's get real. Mario as Chris Pratt was honestly a lot better than expected! I appreciate the performance... Heh... Charlie Day as Luigi wasn't half bad either, i'd almost say it's perfect, but I'll be good. Princess Toadstool Peach also put up a good show, even if lacklustre. But now it's time for the REAL stars of the show, Bowser, Kamek, and Donkey Kong.. Holy Mushroom Macaroni! Let's start with the best. Jack Blacks performance unDOUBTEDLY carried the entire movie, I felt petrified to get outa' ma darn seat! Man, It was perfect... Kamek was also a good lil companion!! It did feel a bit too Illumination-esk at some points.. Hmm, but it was still a great show, now Donkey Kong was Jolly good I tell you! My children, 8 and 7 laughed harder than I ever did when I watched the ""good"" dinosaur!! That's just how funny XD Donkey Kong was, ""Hahahahahahhahahhaahahahhh! He's got the cat pox!!"" LOL 😂. Overall, this show was great, no pun intended! My daughter 7 years of age was rather let down by the minimal role and/or screen time that the Flying Blue Shell got after seeing his prominence on the promotional posters, he felt as if he had wasted potential.. Oh well! Hahah, ever heard of a sequal? That's what they're for! Can't forget Forman Spike, he was jolly good too. 6/10, great movie for the kids, AND.. Maybe Adults, since I wasn't the biggest fan? Wahoo as always Mario, keep on going, NINTENDO!","

"daisukereds","26 April 2023","I must admit, I very much enjoyed this film (considering my expectations).The excitement, speed, energy and action of the animation is enough to make any 30+ Nintendo Fan smile. I believe it was hard for Illumination, with all their talent and experience, to fail in capturing what makes their releases so visually appealing and memorable. On the other hand, I do think Illumination's storytelling has always been lacking.. and this one is no different, but still, enjoyable enough to warrant a trip to the cinema. It is fast and well paced, and great for kids.The plot is a mixture of the real world 1993 Mario movie and video games, where they travel to a magical realm through a pipe (which means that Metro Kingdom and New Donk City don't exist).. adventure ensue!As a Nintendo fan since infancy, I could tell most of the references and ""easter eggs"", and it shows the passion and knowledge of those involved. The creativity employed to weave together many elements from the games into an enjoyable world was all I could ask of them. I was quite impressed with Kong Land visually (even if it's completely different from the original ""lore"").In the sound department (SFX and music), and with Nintendo's extensive library and Koji Kondo's excellent work behind them, hits all the right notes. Though I found the usage of ""radio"" music to feel completely out of place and unnecessary (even if the songs are great on their own).For kids, it's an easy recommendation. Even if it isn't particularly clever, and even kids deserve better writing.. it has good pacing and keeps them engaged.And I am very excited, not for this particular story, but for what it hopefully comes after. Punch Out, F-Zero, Earthbound.. you name it! Hopefully Metroid too.///Now, for some personal grievances:
1.) I don't understand.. was Nintendo THAT afraid that THE Mario movie would bomb, that they spent millions on Hollywood stars that make this feel like an Adam Sandler and friends production? I've always advocated for unknown talent.. specially when it comes to voice actors! Here, it's simply unforgivable how it deteriorates and distracts!! Who voiced Diddy Kong? No one famous! And it doesn't change the fact it was nice to see him beside Chunky and Dixy. Now, every sequel they want to make will cost a foot and an eye.. when they could have given a chance to talented people that actually need work, not a second house to famous rich people.NOTE: I'd like to point out I simply refused to watch this in English first! And that helped my enjoyment tremendously. The English version is, in comparison, appalling.. Watching it again was a chore. Actors like Charlie Day and seth rogen aren't suited for voice acting, much less THESE roles. I was specially happy to hear Charles Martinet in both versions.2.) Regarding characterization, it's somewhat lacking.The Brothers are good (excellent emotional core), albeit safe and generic (like the plot), but work all the same! But Mario not liking Mushrooms? Seems like unnecessary meddling. Bowser is basically Jack Black, a majority seems to like that.. Peach on the other hand, was completely rewritten and is utterly unrecognizable! Personally, didn't like how weird she was.. Easily the worst part for me.3.) The character's face designs look strange sometimes, specially Peach's nose and mouth when she talks down to Mario.. or that squashed Bowser jawline. Again, they took some understandable liberties.4.) There's a lack of world building, as if the story started as you sat down to watch the movie. With a supposedly ongoing war between Kingdoms, I can't make sense of..
There is ONE Power Star in all the lands, and the weakest Penguins hold it for no reason. So it's hard to believe the supposed balance just now crumbles. I can also see some upcoming problems that will arise by showing a map on screen, and putting the Kong Kingdom (which isn't a thing) so close together, but they can just simply retcon them moving forward.5.) No Toadsworth when the part was right there.","

"MrDHWong","6 April 2023","""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a CGI animated film based on Nintendo's signature video game IP ""Mario"". Featuring the voices of Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, and Seth Rogen, it is a fun, fast-paced adventure that should hopefully satisfy Nintendo fans old and new.In Brooklyn, New York, brothers Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (voiced by Charlie Day) run their own plumbing company known as ""Super Mario Bros. Plumbing"" with little success. One night, the brothers learn of a huge manhole leak on the news and decide to go fix it all by themselves. After arriving on the scene, the two venture underground where they are both sucked into a green pipe and separated. Mario ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom, a magical land inhabited by mushroom-like creatures called Toads and ruled by Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy). On the other hand, Luigi ends up in the Dark World, a desolate area controlled by the evil King Bowser (voiced by Jack Black) and his large army of Koopas. Princess Peach informs Mario of her plan to fight back against Bowser, which involves recruiting members of the neighbouring Kong Kingdom. Meanwhile, Bowser has taken Luigi prisoner as he furthers preparations to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom and marry Princess Peach. With time quickly running out, both Mario and Luigi must find their way back together to stop Bowser before he destroys everything in his path to reach the Mushroom Kingdom.If you were to ask someone to compile a list of iconic video game characters, it is more than likely that Mario would be on there ranked very highly. There's virtually no person on Earth who doesn't know who Mario is, whether they've played one of his games or not, that's how famous he is. For me personally, I've been a fan of this moustached Italian plumber since I was a small child, with ""Super Mario All-Stars"" on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System being the second video game I ever owned. On that note, Mario's worldwide recognition has previously resulted in him venturing onto the big screen with 1993's live action movie ""Super Mario Bros."". Though that film did poorly both critically and commercially, Mario's video game popularity remained as strong as ever, and now thirty years later Nintendo has brought their mascot back to cinemas with ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"", an animated feature packed with plenty of fanservice and action that fans are bound to appreciate.In terms of plot, the film is similar to the 1993 version, in that it is basically an origin story of how both Mario and Luigi came to be the Koopa-stomping, power-up wielding brothers we all know and love today. Unlike the 1993 film though, this one feels much more in tune with the games that have been released since then. We see the siblings' humble beginnings in Brooklyn, trying but failing to run a plumbing company that local residents can count on. Of course, the brothers are not taken seriously due to their quirky attire, such as wearing hats with their first initials on them and white gloves to a profession that will obviously result in their hands getting dirty. Regardless, the two of them are always seen to have each other's backs, which is made evident in one scene where Luigi remembers Mario defending him against a bully when they were children. The film does a nice enough job of establishing the brothers' reliance on each other, though it is clear that Luigi is the one who needs his brother the most whereas Mario is shown to function just fine on his own.It's worth mentioning that this is one of the fastest paced movies I've ever seen, so much so that it almost gives ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" a run for its money. Just when you think a scene is about to drag or go nowhere, it cuts to a different one right away. Rather ironically, the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" live action films have a slower pace than this one. As a result, it's practically impossible to ever be bored by this movie. However, this also proves problematic as it doesn't allow the viewer to appreciate some of the visual beauty that has gone into crafting these environments. There's barely a moment to take in the atmosphere of a location before the scene immediately cuts to another one. Although the young kids watching might enjoy this approach, older audiences like parents or old school Nintendo fans like me may be annoyed at how fast things are moving along. I liked seeing how many hidden Easter eggs and references I could spot but the constant quick cutting made it difficult to register every little thing I saw. This film may require a second viewing just to take in most of the visuals, which is either a good or bad thing depending on your level of dedication.With all that said, I loved the art style this film uses. I'm not normally a fan of Illumination's movies due to the cost effective approach they take with their animation but it seems like Nintendo have given them a higher budget to work with this project. From the way the light reflects off Bowser's scales to the strands of hair in Luigi's moustache, this is easily Illumination's best looking movie, though that's not saying a lot. I just wish the film had spent more time establishing the ambience of places like the Mushroom Kingdom, as while it certainly looked great, we hardly feel like we're there long enough to enjoy it properly before the scene cuts away to something else. Regardless, even if you aren't fully immersed in a scene, there's still much to admire in how far both Nintendo and Illumination have gone to make sure this film looks as nice as possible.In spite of the controversy over his casting, I think Chris Pratt did a fine job voicing Mario, at least by mainstream film standards. Pratt plays Mario like a regular Italian-American man, with a deeply rooted love of his culture and an undying respect for his family. He deeply cares about his younger brother Luigi, and is determined to help anybody out no matter how complex the situation may be. Because of that, I found this Mario to be a lot more likeable than his video game counterpart. Bear in mind that Mario has never really had much depth as a character in the games so he was already kind of a blank slate to begin with. For those who still miss Charles Martinet, he has a minor role in the film voicing two other characters, which I won't reveal due to spoilers.Charlie Day's take on Luigi was about as amusing as I had anticipated. Anybody who has watched Day on ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" will be aware of his comedic talents and he translates this pretty effectively into Luigi's character. Day's Luigi is nervous, dimwitted, and is often on the receiving end of many injuries, which mirrors not only Luigi from the games but also his ""Always Sunny"" character. What I took issue with is that he was reduced to being the object of rescue rather than the helpful sidekick to his brother that he should have been. Still, I couldn't help but love Day's Luigi, as it reminded me why he's one of my favourite comic actors currently working.For Princess Peach, Anya Taylor-Joy plays her with considerably more sass than the version from the games. She's more down-to-earth, open-minded, and not afraid to fight back if the circumstances demand it. Naturally the idea of a damsel-in-distress wouldn't work in today's world so this compromise seems necessary. I liked watching how she and Mario actually looked as though they were forming a genuine friendship with each other, and that she isn't just some stock girl for him to save from the bad guy. If anything, I'd say that Taylor-Joy's depiction of Princess Peach is the best one I've seen so far.I think this film's Bowser was a lot of fun to watch, not just because it's Jack Black playing him, but also due to him having a more eccentric personality this time around. There are even parts where he expresses his true feelings through song, which is of course tailored to suit Black's background in music. Black has always been good at playing likeable weirdos (i.e. Himself) and to see that shown through a villain like Bowser makes him seem less evil and more misunderstood. With that in mind, Black is still more than capable of bringing out Bowser's malicious side whenever necessary.Though he's not in the film as much as I'd have liked, I think Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong was a nice addition to the cast of characters. Rogen's Kong is nearly identical to the video game version, he's super strong but pretty dense in terms of intellect. Without spoiling too much, this film shows how he and Mario became rivals in the first place, in an introductory scene I think fans of both series are sure to enjoy. Hopefully we'll see more of this Donkey Kong in a future installment, whether it's a sequel or a spin-off.As the beginning of potential film franchise, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a pretty decent way to kick things off for Nintendo. If it had spent more time focusing on its world building and ambience, then I'd be more inclined to recommend it to everyone. However, I can only really see it appealing to Nintendo fans and young children so if you fit that bill then this film is for you. I just hope that if any future films are produced, Mario related or not, that both Nintendo and Illumination will take into account a wider audience, since there are so many more stories to be told. Either way, I'm mostly satisfied with what we've got so far.I rate it 7/10.","

"marioreds-40453","5 April 2023","It truly is beyond me how anyone other than a small child could rate this movie positively. Videogames are one thing, movies are a different story. I only watched it because someone had to go to the cinema with my child and guess what, he wanted to come with dad, because he knows that my favourite game of all time is Super Mario Bros 3 for nes, so he felt I was a better company than his mother to enjoy this movie with. Fair enough. But as an adult, i already knew from the trailer I was in for an absolute drivel. A not particularly original plot, a ""modern"" version of princess toadstool which per se is neither good nor bad, because it doesn't really add anything to the story, some fan service... That's it. I don't even know what to say, because this movie is basically... Nothing. A platform game doesn't need an interesting plot, nor a credible character development, the fun is in the game mechanics. But a movie does. For children under 8 only, at 9 I figure they have already outgrown this stuff.","

Young kids would enjoy it if they are mario fans, however as an adult the plot was just abysmal, no questions asked by anyone and its missing a lot of what I would have hoped they would use from the games...Sonic movies were far far more enjoyable.Honestly I liked the original live action movie more than this one, it at least tried to give you a coherent story line.This is probably Illuminations worst film, all their others I enjoyed with kids but this one really missed with how rushed it felt.If you have young kids I'd take them but if you would question why someone ends up in a completely different world and doesnt bother asking ANY questions on the bizzare differences its not for you.Chris Pratt and Jack Black were great voice actor choices for the characters.","

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","8 April 2023","When I was growing up in the 90's, I remember playing the Super Mario games (notably the Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Party games) and loved them very much. They were imaginative, colorful, characters that have some charm, and some of the catchiest music in history. Later on, as a young adult, when I heard that both Universal and Illumination Entertainment were adapting the IP into an animated feature film after the 1993 cinematic flop, I was interested in how both of the studios were gonna pull it off.So my brother and I, being the Super Mario Bros. Fans we are, went to see it after it came out only to end up having a very enjoyable time. Now, before I can go into detail on why this movie is so good, I'd like to say that I'm not really an Illumination fan. For starters, I thought the first two Despicable Me movies were good, but the other films they made have been either passable (Minions: The Rise of Gru, the Sing movies), mediocre/forgettable (the Secret Life of Pets movies, The Grinch, Despicable Me 3 and Minions) or just downright terrible (Hop and The Lorax). So I was a little hesitant at first considering the studio's reputation for mostly appealing to the young demographic. Not to mention I was baffled at some of the casting choices for this movie.That being said, the studio managed to do some homework when making this film. Ok, it does have some problems, but as a 90's person who grew up with the games, this was a love letter done right.First off, the animation is so breathtakingly gorgeous and some of the best Illumination has done. Not only does it succeed at being faithful to the visual aesthetics from the Mario and Donkey Kong games, but the character animation designs/movements are accurate which made me so happy. Not to mention the world building is great. The action, however, is where the animation excels even more as it does have a sense of intensity and energy. Also, the music score from Brian Tyler is one of the highlights of the film. He did a fantastic job at his own rendition of the themes from the Mario games with the help of Koji Kondo (the guy who created the music for the original Mario games) and mixes them with some new themes, creating an epic magical musical narrative.The story, while not too deep and does have some cringe worthy moments, is very fast-paced and engaging on it's own right. Also, it's nods to the video games were well deserved which made me very happy. The comedy, while not the best, is at least funny and doesn't feel over exaggerated. The characters are likeable enough (especially Bowser who is the best part of the movie) and the voice cast was surprisingly good. Chris Pratt did grew on me as the voice of Mario, Charlie Day suited Luigi's cowardly personality very well, Anna Taylor-Joy is heartfelt and courageous as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key is both silly and also aspiring as Toad, Seth Rogen and Fred Armisen did fine as both Donkey Kong and King Cranky Kong and Jack Black is both threatening yet also comedic as Bowser which is a good combo for both intimidating and hilarious at the same time. Plus it was nice that Chris Martinet, the original voice of Mario, got to be in the movie while Kevin Michael Richardson, one of the best voice actors in history, did a great job as Kamek, Bowser's advisor.Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not only a great love letter to the video games, but it's an enjoyable movie on it's own right. To those who love the Mario games and everything else Nintendo related, check this one out and you'll have a rockin' good time. :)","

"hctwwrvtpq","12 April 2023","Let's be honest, Super Mario Bros. The Movie was never meant to be a deep meaning, subversive film in cinema. If that is what you are looking for, this is not the movie for you. However, if you, like most of us from Generation X and on, grew up with a controller in your hand, Mario will deliver on so many levels (pun intended).Super Mario Bros. The Movie is loaded with so much charm you will be grinning from ear to ear for so long, you'll think you have a curly brown mustache by the second teaser as the end credits roll. It is a visual delight that is fitting for any Mario fan. There are references and Easter eggs so abundant that even a casual fan is sure to pick up on something. It has humor, it has excitement, and it has style.Video game based movies are notoriously bad. Just check out the Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo Super Mario Bros. Movie and Mortal Kombat if you don't believe me. That, however, seems like a trend that is ending. While Disney has milked the Marvel and Star Wars franchises for all they are worth, gaming may provide a new basis of inspiration for films, and Super Mario Bros. The Movie looks like it may be paving that way.Without giving too much away, Mario and Luigi are brothers who live in New York as struggling plumbers. They have a family that isn't too supportive, no matter how hard they try to make it in the business. Luigi is lovable, but a bit cowardly, while Mario is always quick to stand up for and protect his younger brother, despite his small stature.In a plumbing job that Mario excitedly undertakes, Luigi and then Mario fall into a drainage pipe that leads to the Mushroom Kingdom. They are separated and Mario undertakes a mission to find his brother. Meanwhile, a baddie King Koopa named Bowser is eager to conquer all he sees in order to win the heart of Princess Peach, who rules the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario happens across Toad, a little mushroom guy, and seeks out the Princess for help in rescuing his brother. Thus, the adventure begins.I won't go into more detail as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but this movie delivers by turning the nostalgia level to 11. There is so much visual splendor and dozens of laugh-out-loud moments, anyone under the age of 50 is certain to have a blast with this movie.My only real complaint is that I wish the film could have been maybe 10-15 minutes longer by sprinkling a few added exposition scenes here and there. It would have fleshed out the story a bit and would have added another layer of depth to the story. Perhaps, this first foray didn't require such depth; but going forward, other entries or movies from Nintendo and Illumination will need to include a bit more story.Overall, this movie is all about making that kid inside you smile and it delivers on that in droves. This is a great first entry in what is sure to be many Nintendo movies in the future. Anyone who has ever hummed the Super Mario Bros. Theme or remembers spending the night at a friend's while passing the controller back and forth in order to beat King Koopa and find the Princess owes it to themselves to see this movie.It's for kids. It's for adults. There is no political message. It is just good old fashioned family fun. Super Mario Bros. The Movie is a winner. Go out and see for yourself. You'll be happy you did.","

"freethinkingworld","22 April 2023","Now this is what I want to see in New Family Friendly Animated Films! I was really impressed with how good this was, all the references to the Mario/Nintendo games really does show the love for them. The voice acting was actually really done well by everyone involved. Jack Black was a huge stand out. The animation was gorgeous, and my favorite thing would have to be the soundtrack. Not only was Jack Black's song a pleasant surprise, but the new song like the Mario Theme and the Mario Kart Theme and others was so great! I really loved that part of it. But overall really really well done, and I'm so glad it did well.","

"Marynewcomb2013","4 August 2023","First off, the rating this film has on here is far overrated!! The movie was cute but not great! The story of Bowser/King Kopa wanting to marry Peach/Princess Toadstool was just dumb!! The having Luigi being a chicken was also dumb!! The crossing over to Brooklyn was another uncalled for event! The voice cast was the worst I ever heard for an animated/CGI!! The brothers should have the accent! Jack Black was not good! The young girl voice Peach has been a bad actor in everything she's been in! Seth doing DK? DK should have had a deep, rough voice!! I hope if they do a Zelda film, they let people who will do it Justice make it & not the team that made this!!","

"shadowmario-46470","16 April 2023","Many of you folks may have been unlucky to see the Super Mario Bros. Live action film from 1993 that starred the late Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi respectively. The movie was horrible, corny, and didn't make sense to many fellow Mario fans, including my sister and I. When I reconnected with my love for video games around the age of 16, I read a lot of jeers for the infamous Super Mario Bros. Film. Heck, I read that Bob Hoskins said that it was the WORST film he ever did...And then...along came Illumination's idea to adapt Mario. I've seen their wonderful movies, including the Despicable Me films (let alone the Minions movies), and when I saw the trailer where I heard Jack Black voicing Bowser in a far more menacing way (than how he would voice protagonists, such as Po in the Kung Fu Panda films), I was hooked.I won't give away the movie, but the animation was superb. Hearing Chris Pratt (who I first learned of as Emmet Brickowski in The Lego Movie) as Mario was a bit odd with no Italian accent. Let it be known that I am FAR MUCH USED to Charles Martinet doing Mario's voice as of now.While I saw this movie at a drive-in theater (as the weather in Upstate New York was unusually warm), I was hearing a lot of familiar songs in the Mario games (including the oh-so-famous overground theme from Super Mario Bros., which is ubiquitous), and seemed to do ""Name That Mario Game Tune"" throughout the movie.Bottom line, this movie is LOADS better than the infamous 1993 film. If you didn't see the 1993 film, you're lucky. Go see this film for your own sake if you're a Mario fan.","

"james-61862","14 April 2023","Loved it. One of the best looking animated movies, a perfect movie recreation of Nintendo's gaming world. Yes the plot isn't that deep but really doesn't need to be - this is a film made to be pure fun and is a fine tribute to Mario and his crew. Easter egg packed and a superb soundtrack.The artwork is stunning - the film really pops with colourful visuals and nods to many of the games' elements and worlds.Jack Black as Bowser is the star of the show but the rest of the cast do a great job recreating the famous characters.At around an hour and a half it doesn't outstay it's welcome and can't wait to watch it again.","

"EdwardtheBlackPrince","6 April 2023","It's been 30 years since the brothers were last on the Big screen, and with the ever-changing culture in adaptations. Now seemed a perfect time more than ever to take another shot at the Italian plumber's. The Super Mario Bros Movie is a film for Fans that respects its fan and the Source Material. While its story is paper thin, Essentially the brothers get sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi gets captured and Mario has to form a team to save his Brother and Stop the evil Bowser from destroying everything. Honestly, that's fine now if this was any other franchise such as Legend of Zelda or Metroid I be more critical of that. Mario has never been the Narrative Franchise. It has always leveled down to wholesome fun, and in many ways, the film delivers all of that. The animation's beautiful The world is bright and vivid and appealing to look at the settings feel like levels from the games. When the characters are jumping around you can see that 3d platforming. The soundtrack is good when it mixes elements of the games and adds little spins it fits. However, like practically every animated movie there are pop cultural songs. They're not awful, but you could have left them out. The Cast as a whole for the most part they're good. Chris Pratt as Mario he's fine. He was the one everybody was most worried about, He's not great it's not Charles Martinet who does have a cameo. However, he tries and doesn't half-ass it. Save with Charlie Day as Luigi. When he first shows up in the Mushroom Kingdom he's confused and starstruck with this world, but he adjusts to the situation. He's not some bumbling idiot the whole movie. Princess Peach, I like her she got some funny movies. Yeah, she's not the Damsel being rescued this time again they decided to do that with Luigi which sucks a little because, for the most part, he's absent from a huge chunk of the film until the end in the Mario Bros Movies, but I enjoy him for the few scenes he got. As for Peach she serves as Mario's guide to this World and helps to aid and to get an army to fight Bowser. She has her moments, but Mario is still the Hero of the film. Speaking of half-assing Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong is honestly the most unbearable in the movie. He doesn't even try to do a character it's just him playing himself, not Donkey Kong. Who just comes off as a Cringy Teenager and a idiot. That says something I should be not saying Donkey Kong is the most unbearable when you have Toad in the movie. Lastly, we have Bowser voiced by Jack Black Who's the funniest in the entire film. From beginning to end they do a great job with his voice of making Bowser come off as opposing and a threat to just being obsessed with Peach and going Gaga for her. He's having a blast and it shows. If there's something that can be criticized really most is the pacing. It does feel like you could give a little more time for the story to flesh out the world and the relationships between the characters. There's a section where they show the other islands through a quick Transition and you even see Yoshi's, a couple of minutes in these other worlds would have been cool. The Humor works in the sense that there are jokes that don't hit that well sometimes, but the Slapstick is more fun. And when comes to Fanservice there is a ton of it. Some of them can be missed if you're not looking closely enough and it's not just blatantly thrown in there you face the whole time plenty of things can be found in the backgrounds through the music and lines. Like when Peach says there is a whole Galaxy of Worlds out there or The Plumbing Commercial. It adds to the Nostalgia and Charm of the Fans. I would compare it to the Lego Batman movie where on the surface there's Humor, but Deep in the easter Eggs a lot more appreciation shows and adds to the overall dialogue. It is not executed to the extent of Batman, but it falls under the Banner of its a fun adventure for all, appealing to children as well as nintendo Fans.","

This movie will be perfect family entertainment. The visuals were vivid and absolutely stunning. The voice acting was fantastic, the jokes landed and made the kids happy. It was a wonderful experience.They made references to my generation's Mario, and the Mario that my kid is familiar with. And they did it in a Nintendo way, not in a money grabbing Hollywood way.The story was also adorable, and even though it's obviously targeted at a younger audience, adults will not be bored at all. I enjoyed the movie, my daughter loved it, this is a win for Nintendo.I am so happy that this movie felt like a Nintendo product and less a Hollywood product, even though it was produced and published by Hollywood.

"ossie85","10 April 2023","The Super Mario Brothers movie certainly delivers when it comes to fun action sequences, but unfortunately, the thin plot and poor character development hold it back. It's clear that the filmmakers had a lot of creative ideas for the visual design of the movie, but they didn't quite know how to bring these elements together into a cohesive and engaging story. The result is a movie experience that feels somewhat disjointed, with characters feeling underdeveloped and their motivations often unclear. Despite these issues, the movie does have a certain energy and charm to it that makes it entertaining to watch, especially for fans of the Mario Brothers games. Overall, I would give the Super Mario Brothers movie a 6/10 - it's definitely flawed, but it's worth watching for the action sequences and unique visual style, and of course the nostalgia.","

"L8ton-Rocks","29 November 2023","I like this movie, but it could've been a whole better. There are a ton of problems I have with this movie and I'm gonna explain it here.First of all, I wanna discuss about some of the characters.While I dislike peach in the games, I think she is equally as bad in this movie. They basically changed her whole character into being like Princess Daisy. (which they should've added into the movie BTW) they also make it feel as if peach was the main character and not Mario. She's so OP that she could've just went to the jungle kingdom, beat DK in the fight and save her kingdom on her own. If you think about it, Mario only came along to rescue Luigi. I feel like the training montage scene with mario would've been better if they simply removed the scene with peach effortlessly completing the course. Another thing I don't like about peach was the fact that she kept disrespecting Mario whenever he was short. Like the lines ""because you're very, very small"" and the fact he embarrassed him in front of the toads with ""He's not important!"". But the worst moment of peach is when she shoved a mushroom down Mario's throat. Look, making someone a jerk does not make that character cooler, it makes them more unlikable. Also in the wedding climax, she decided to light king Bob omb's fuse while the chain was defrosting and she had a whole five seconds to freeze again but it was too late. Well maybe you shouldn't have lit the fuse then. So yeah peach isn't any better from the movie than she has in the games and is in my opinion the most overrated character.DK was also really unlikable in this movie. He just becomes so salty after he loses the fight and constantly argues with Mario and it's really not fun at all. Like there could've been a really good scene when they were swallowed by the eel. Since they both have dad's who think ""they're a joke"" they would end up sympathising with each other and basically having a truce before the climax.Spike was only there just to be a downright bully to Mario and serves nothing to the plot. Although what's stops him from becoming the downright worst is that he only appears in the beginning and in the end and does have a slight turn around.Now as much as I liked Luigi, I just wish he had more screen time. He was just completely sidelined in this. Now for a movie called ""The Super Mario Bros Movie"" I would want both characters to have an equal amount of screen time and to have an adventure with each other, not just one of them.But by far the worst character in this movie is Lumalee. He has this one gag throughout the movie where he just makes death jokes and makes everyone miserable in the dungeon. Now if they were trying to have a comic relief for this movie then it's completely unnecessary. Because we already have Toad for that, and he was perfectly fine and is home to the best joke in the movie (The cooking distraction joke) and also, how is joking about death funny? It's not. The only character that does good funny death jokes is the muffin from ASDF movie And Lumalee absolutely serves nothing to the plot.And I'm sorry to all, but I really did not like the peaches song. It's just not that funny. It's especially annoying when you hear it all over tik-tok and YouTube shorts.But there was one scene in particular that I really do not like and it is by far one of the worst scenes in this movie. The scene where Mario was about to equip the fire flower, but then DK blows it out.You can't just blow out a fire flower! That's never be covered in the games! And if it was always like that then whenever mario has the fire flower equipped in a windy level, it should've worn off him the second it gets windy. And does this mean you can blow out an Ice flower? And would that defrost it?I also kinda wish that this movie was at least 20 more minutes longer, it's just feels a bit to short and had no time for character development.Now I'm gonna talk about the positives. And believe me there were quite a lot. Cause like I said, I liked this movie. I think the action scenes were really well done with the exception of the ice peach scene (cause of that explosion ruining the scene) the way they introduced the mini mushroom was pretty good. Although bowser's motives were similar to Mario Odyssey, I would call him the best character in this movie. I like how the movie spends a bit of time in Brooklyn before going into the mushroom Kingdom which is something not a lot of movies do. I liked the way the mushroom kingdom looked and is by far the best iteration of it. Yet again, Toad was actually a pretty good comic relief and is the most underrated character in this movie. The soundtrack is well orchestrated and made me wish that there wasn't any of that licensed music that was sprinkled throughout this movie. And the Mario Kart scene is by far the best scene in the movie (although I didn't like what peach did in a certain shot in this scene, aka where she got an island collapsed and almost killed Toad) And that Blue Shell character definitely made the scene worth while.Anyway thanks for reading this review, if you disagree with some of the stuff I said that's fine.Verdict: 7.2/10.","

"samissoawkward","5 April 2023","When I first saw the R* T* score, I thought to myself, ""That can't be right."" Sure, movie critics are movie critics, but it's unfair that a low score could potentially stop audiences from seeing this fantastic movie.I grew up a Nintendo kid. I grew up with the Mario games. My delight was immeasurable when it was first announced that an animated movie was in the works. Despite the negative reactions to the cast announcements, I held out hope. And after seeing the movie on it's first day out, I'm glad my belief was not misplaced.People will say that this is merely a flex of Illumination's skill, visually. This movie was a sight to behold on the big screen, many ""Blink and you'll miss it"" moments. But that's not all the movie has to offer. The writing is good, never a dull moment. Brilliant voice direction. The cast completely transformed and became their characters. Story-wise, its simple, easy to follow, with some heartfelt moments in there. It's unfair for people to demand so much depth from a movie that is mainly targeted towards kids and Nintendo/Mario fans.The main objective with this movie was for people to have fun watching it. And I did. And you will too. So go see it!","

It was just fine. It was just another animated movie based on a video game, with some stuff for the fans and some jokes.The animation was bright and pretty. The voices were alright. The story was easy to guess and cheesy, which is fine for an animated casual movie.If you want a fun and easy movie for the family, you might like it, but don't expect to be blown away by anything new or cool.","

"TheMysteriousReviewer","16 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros Movie steps up from the terrible live action movie to 30 years later into a really fun movie based on a big game franchise. I wish the movie could've at least took more time on the writing and give character development instead of rushing through it. But that wouldn't keep from having talented voice acting, references that gives a tribute to the games, and exciting action scenes. But what I appreciate the most is the animation. I'm not gonna lie, this would probably have the best animation Illumination has produced in any movie. It upgrades every reference and background from the games for a movie and they're all breathtaking and lifelike. Of course, the Mario fans are going to have a great time with this movie. But just like with the Sonic films, I recommend this movie based on a video game to have a good time. Now the dark ages of movies based on video games is over, just hopefully that we will see more that will get progressively better for the rest of the 2020 decade. And the fact Illumination has teamed up with Nintendo to make movies, this is on to a good start.","

"rockenenglish","20 May 2023","All I can say is that it was Super Fun and Nostalgic for myself (37) and my daughter (5). I loved Super Mario games from NES, GAMEBOY, SNES, N64, CUBE, Wii but did take a brake until more recently on the SWITCH. I also enjoyed the live action Mario Bros movie back in the 90s (man those Gumbas were hilarious, I mean...ridiculous lol) as so was the cartoon I used to watch as a kid.This movie was just a great way to tie in so much nostalic happy memories of all those games crossing over 4 generations. That ain't easy to do in 1hr20mins. When I went to see it, it was mostly Parents with their kids. Not many adults by themselves. But, that's the question, who was the target demographic? Is it the OG game fans who are 30-40? Or Kids 5-15 that love playing Mario on Switch?I thought the designs were great, especially the platform for Mario's Test Trial. And the Rainbow Course in the Mario Kart race was epic with all the different weapons from SNES to Switch.Jack Black as Bowser was amazing.I get some of the criticism at the other actors for a lack of creativity with their voice.And the lack of character depth besides Mario.For me, it's memorable as it was my daughter's first movie at the cinema and she loved it all the way through. She now loves saying Mama Mia! So it's a 7 for me but an add point for my personal memories.","

"reubent-71726","13 April 2023","I'm still not sure if the movie would have been better with the original Mario voice, or with Chris Pratt. Aside from that, the movie stayed true to the games, adding all the elements you could possibly want in a Mario movie. You got mustaches, you got pipes, you got mushrooms and goombas. I don't remember if there were goombas, but I remember there being everything else. Bowser being played by Jack Black is perfect. I dunno why they made Bowser sing that song, but I'm going to assume that Jack Black wouldn't sign the contract unless a melody was included. There really wasn't much to the story except the exploration of the Mario universe, and to save Luigi and the kingdoms. I guess in the original Mario game the point was to save the princess, but in this case the princess was a badass and ended up saving them. No plumbing skills required. I also didn't realize Mario didn't like mushrooms.","

It is not offensive and relatively harmless.The world seems thought out, the Kongs were decent, the game music was really well done and presented. The 80ies and 70ies music has been used in the same way, billions of other products and was really off-putting. Reminded me that it is indeed, just a movie and not an experience.Besides of Peach, the adaptation was relatively ""faithful"" and well done.

"kjproulx","6 April 2023","Mario has been a staple for me since I was a kid. Whether playing classic games on handheld consoles or playing Mario Party, Super Mario 64, Mario Kart, or Smash Bros. (the list is endless), I've loved playing in this particular sandbox. Well, after many years, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has now hit theatres and while it's far from great, I also found it hard to dislike. The world of Mario has been out there for decades and decades, so if you're unaware of the basics, this film will not be for you, but I really doubt many people will see this film and not understand it. This is a film (at least for me) that gets a pass for being a film that's strictly made for the fans because if you're not, it's not hard to follow at all.Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, The Super Mario Bros. Movie starts with Mario and Luigi trying to build a successful plumbing company in the real world. After stumbling across a green pipe underground, they are both sucked into the fantasy world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Separated from each other along the way inside, Mario ends up in the happier section of this world, befriending Princess Peach and Toad. Luigi ends up in a darker section, finding himself kidnapped by the villain, Bowser. Mario must learn the ways of this world in order to save Luigi. There isn't any further plot than that, so that was my first negative.Yes, as always, Illumination has animated this film perfectly well and seeing it in 3D really made it pop even more. From the terrific musical score by Brian Tyler and the precisely placed sounds by Randy Thom, I felt like I was being sucked into the world of the video games. There is some clever humour, and the voice acting by Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially Jack Black all surprisingly worked well for me. This film in terms of characters, action, and technical aspects, is pretty much perfect for a film based on the world of Mario. Sadly, what kept me from loving this film was the story itself.It's fine to have a thin story, but the adventure itself felt all over the place and felt more like the movie just wanted to be a piece of fan service over everything else. That didn't ruin the movie for me like it usually would though because everything except for the story had a lot of time and effort put into it. Similar to how I felt about the recent film, Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, stuff happened and I had a good time. If you're looking for something spectacular that will blow you away in terms of storytelling, I recommend something else. However, if you're just wanting to be transported to a fun world for an hour and a half, I think it's worth checking out, and yes, absolutely bring your kids to this one, it might become a new favourite of theirs.","

"jonahp-08326","19 April 2023","I want to start of by saying if you aren't already a Mario fan, you'll most likely be a bit lost watching this movie and you probably won't like it as much as someone who has played any of the games (but I feel like that's a given with any adaptation) but with that being said as a live long Mario fan man did it deliver on being an awesome movie that made it super rewarding being a fan.The casting was a big subject of discussion when they were first announced back in 2021, more specifically Chris Pratt as the titular ""Super Mario"" and did he deliver a good performance? I actually think he did pretty good in the role of Mario, it worked well for what the movie was going for and how they wrote the characters. The changes made to the characters in the film was very important to making the movie feel more like real movie. It goes without saying but Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser was fantastic, he made Bowser such a funny and actually somewhat charming villain.The main areas where the movie lacked for me was both the story itself and the pacing. The story was very basic and almost non existent which is accurate to the games but for a movie I think they could've fleshed it out a bit more than they did but the pacing is where the movie really struggled for me. The movies pacing is really really fast, they go very quickly from scene to scene which in a way makes it feel rushed on the first watch, when I watched it for the second time in the theater I noticed that the pacing felt better the second time but it definitely still felt really fast compared to other films. The quick pacing does add to the movies video game feel with how it goes from location to location just like going level to level but I think that if they spent a little bit more time in the brooklyn part of the movie.Overall this film is a must see for any nintendo and Super Mario fan, the movie stands out as not only one of the best video game movies but one of and if not the best animated movie made by illumination right next to the original despicable me, I highly recommend this film to anyone who has played a Super Mario game.","

"tommypezmaster","9 August 2023","What did critic expect? It actually a more faithful to Mario than the live-action is. Was it THAT hard to turn Super Mario Brothers into a movie? Illumination thought not, thanks assistance from Nintendo themselves.The Easter eggs and iconic score remixes are what really made the movie fun to experience. The gave Peach and more fleshed out personality, gave witty banter for Mario and DK to be rivals and probably the most of what people said was the best, seeing Jack Black having fun as the role of Bowser.I love how the filmmakers gave an excellent reason for Mario to have and underdog story and bonus points for bringing back Spike from Wrecking Crew.It's a shame that Cranky Kong was badly butchered in the film, but that's forgivable consider how good the film turned out.","

"manasbhati","13 April 2023","The music:Composer Brian Tyler (Iron Man 3, Crazy Rich Asians) claims that he added around ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY references to previous Mario games in his score for the film. That's more than one reference per minute. Plus, they aren't just copy-pasted through the movie - they were rearranged with the orchestra, making it sound grander than ever.The legendary Konji Kondo, who composed many of the previous Mario themes, was also closely involved with this project. And I'm sure you can hear his impact in the film.The soundtrack isn't just Mario references; Tyler creates a whole set of new themes for the main characters. They are pretty memorable, and they do their primary job: flesh out the characters while not removing the charm of the previous Mario video game music.However, all this praise only applies to 75 percent of the music in the film. The other 25 percent of the film was filled with out-of-place 20th-century rock and pop music. When you think of Mario, do you think of 20th-century rock and pop? I certainly don't, and it made those scenes kinda painful to watch. Still, this doesn't matter when compared to Brian Tyler's monumental achievement. Removing half a star due to the rock and pop, though.9 out of 10.The film:The plot is very basic. If this were the story of any other film, nobody would watch it. But this isn't any other film. This is the Mario movie. People don't play Mario games expecting a complex plot.If you ignore the story, you can really see the passion of the people behind the project. The reason for a basic, fast-paced story was to squeeze in as many Mario video game references as possible. I haven't played some of them, but throughout the film, I found myself thinking ""Oh hey, I know this one!"" A great trip down the memory lane for me.Think of this film as a love letter to the ever-lasting legacy of the Mario video games - you'll like it much more. If you don't know much about Mario, then stay away. Almost nothing in this film will make sense.7 out of 10.","

"Drawmort","12 May 2023","Wow! Hollywood finally figured out how to really merge with video games. This is the film that takes a turn and shows itself as a clear example of how to do things. Do you want to adapt a video game to the big screen? Follow the recipe for Super Mario Bros! The true essence of Nintendo's most famous saga is not only maintained but also multiplied resulting in a dizzying, yet simple story of heroism and adventure. Thousands of direct references to the games where Mario and Luigi are protagonists, shown in different ways. Settings, characters, subplots, sound, soundtrack, even little jokes.As a film, the product does its job. Knowing how to identify the purpose of the filmmakers, which is to entertain on a 200-kilometer-per-hour trip, you realize that the simplicity of the script gives free rein to the graphics and the heroic feat of its characters.The voice actors fulfill their role in a decent way, without standing out much, except for Jack Black, who really shines in his character.Ninety minutes that feels like ten, in what is probably the best animated movie of the year so far.Totally recommended for everyone over seven years old (there is some violence that is somewhat strong for the little ones).","

"johnperugia","7 April 2023","Im a big video game fan but this movie just didn't hold my attention at all. If fan service is throwing everything on a screen and seeing what sticks, this has fan service I guess. To me it all was just a Nintendo themed movie. The music was a big let down. A lot of the music has been over used in movies lately. Kinda killed the musical aspects of the film for me. The whole thing felt kinda phoned in. Chris Pratt's voice is so recognizable now from everything else he has voiced that it ruined Mario for me. It killed a lot of the movie magic. Really wanted to like this movie but it's just a mediocre animated kids movie. The film makers were lucky to have such a vast pool of source material.","

"andyajoflaherty","14 April 2023","Based on the long running video game series of the same name, Super Mario Bros follows Brooklyn brothers Mario and Luigi as they struggle to make ends meet with their plumbing business. After a city wide disaster causes flooding, the brothers venture into the sewers to fix the water main, and discover a mysterious pipe that transports them to another world. Becoming seperated, Mario must team up with the princess of the land and an unlikely simian ally to take down maniacal overlord Bowser and rescue his brother.Well, it's certainly better than the 90's Mario movie, I will say that, and also unlike that movie this is an extremely faithful adaptation of the games. It looks great, has lots of heart and humour and is a great time for kids. However, Nintendo have played it extremely safe here, with none of the subtle jokes or humour for adults that makes these animated films really shine. It's a good first effort, and I hope this means more quality 'games as films' are on the way, but just isn't quite there somehow...","

"cyifly-2","8 April 2023","I took my 9 and 10-year-old kids to see it and they loved it. That is their target audience, so that is what you should take into account when going to see something like this. With that in mind... Did I like it? Yes. It was good family entertainment and I enjoyed seeing my family enjoy it. It had several things in it that were also meant for adults to get, like lots of action, great 3D, 'Easter eggs' only adults would get -- such as Jack Black singing in his old Tenacious D style, hidden jokes, old characters and many more. The score was like it was a character by itself and kept the action rolling and the use of 80s music also helped. You have to take it for what it is, who it is intended for, and just go with it. If you are not bringing kids... Maybe not something you have to rush out and see. But if you have ever played a Mario game and you have kids who have played them as well... It's really fun.","

"jboothmillard","15 April 2023","I played a couple of the Nintendo games when I was a kid, the original Bob Hoskins/Dennis Hopper movie (the first feature length live-action film based on a video game) was naff, so expectations were high for this new computer-animated film, from Illumination, the creators of the Minions. Basically, Italian American brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are plumbers in Brooklyn, New York, and have recently started their own business. Mario left his steady job in plumbing, he is antagonised by his former boss Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco), but they are determined to prove him and their disapproving father (Charles Martinet, who voices Mario and Luigi in the games) wrong. They are delighted to receive a call for their first job, but it goes horribly wrong. The brothers see on the news there is a significant manhole leak beneath the city, and go underground to fix it, hoping it will get media attention. Underground, they find a series of strange pipes, and they become sucked into a Warp Pipe and separated. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, where he meets anthropomorphic mushroom Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) who wants to be his friend and guides him. Luigi lands in the Dark Lands, ruled by the evil Koopa king Bowser (Jack Black), who has stolen a powerful Super Star, and plots to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. Toad takes Mario to meet Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was abandoned as a child, was raised by the residents of the kingdom, and proved herself to become ruler. Bowser is smitten with the princess and has delusions that she will fall in love with him. Bowser seeks to marry Peach and will destroy the kingdom if she refuses. He is holding Luigi prisoner to blackmail Mario, whom he sees as competition for Peach's love. Peach plans to ally with the primate Kongs to fight against Bowser and his Koopa army. Peach has Mario take on a training course to prove himself worthy of joining her on her journey, after various attempts he comes close enough to satisfying her. Peach, Mario, and Toad reach the Jungle Kingdom and meet the ruler King Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen). It is agreed that the Kongs will help the Mushroom Kingdom, on the condition that Mario fights and defeats the king's son, Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). During the fight, Donkey Kong has great strength, but Mario eventually defeats him using a Cat Suit. Mario, Peach, Toad, and the Kongs use karts to drive on Rainbow Road back to the Mushroom Kingdom, but they are ambushed by Bowser's army. When part of the road is destroyed by a Koopa General (Scott Menville), Mario and Donkey Kong fall into the ocean and are eaten by an eel-like Maw-Ray while the other Kongs are captured. Peach and Toad return to the Mushroom Kingdom and urge the citizens to evacuate. Bowser arrives aboard his flying castle and proposes to Peach who initially refuses. But she changes her mind and accepts when Toad is tortured by Bowser's advisor Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson). Mario and Donkey Kong inside the stomach of the Maw-Ray bond over how their respective dads never take their decisions seriously. They eventually escape the Maw-Ray by riding a rocket from Donkey Kong's kart and hurry to Bowser and Peach's wedding. While the wedding is proceeding, Bowser intends to execute Luigi and all the other prisoners in lava in Peach's honour. Toad sneaks an Ice Flower in Peach's bouquet, which Peach uses to freeze Bowser. Mario and Donkey Kong arrive and free the prisoners, with Mario using a Tanooki Suit (similar to a raccoon) to save Luigi. Bowser is enraged and free himself, summoning a Banzai Bill (a torpedo) to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario knocks the warhead off course and directs it into the Warp Pipe where it detonates. The explosion causes a vacuum that sucks Bowser's castle to be transported to Brooklyn. As they fight Bowser, Mario and Luigi grab the Super Star, become invincible, and defeat the Koopas. Bowser is shrunk with a Mini Mushroom and held prisoner. Mario and Luigi are praised as heroes and celebrated by the people of Brooklyn, including their parents and Spike. Sometime later, Mario and Luigi move into a new house together in the Mushroom Kingdom. Also starring Jessica DiCicco as Mario's Mom, Rino Romano as Uncle Tony, John DiMaggio as Uncle Arthur, Khary Payton as Penguin King, Juliet Jelenic as Lumalee, and Eric Bauza as Toad General. Pratt and Day are fine as the Mario brothers, and Taylor-Joy is reasonable as the cute and feisty princes, but Black you can tell is enjoying himself as the dragon-like villain who improvises some songs at the piano (some of the funniest bits). The animation is suitably colourful and character design does not disappoint, there are several references and easter eggs to be spotted gamers will recognise and enjoy (question mark cubes, warp pipes, Super Mario Kart, Piranha Plants), and the choice of 80s songs (""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" by Beastie Boys, ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by Electric Light Orchestra, ""Holding Out for a Hero"" by Bonnie Tyler, ""Take on Me"" by a-ha) in the soundtrack is interesting. There are a few humorous moments, and the voice cast are good, but it feels like a leaky faucet the plumber brothers would be called to fix. It has no real substance and it is bland and all over the place, it is much better than the 1993 movie, and the kids and fans may be entertained, but it could have been better, an alright computer-animated adventure comedy. Okay!","

"shadowenderscar","23 April 2023","As an avid Nintendo fan, I not enjoyed the story, but all the references as well. There's plenty of familiar scores throughout the movie, as well as other pop culture jams. You can tell both teams at Illumination and Nintendo put their heart and souls into this. The fact that Nintendo was involved in the first place should tell you the obvious care that went into this movie, because Nintendo doesn't mess around.And no, it's not a reboot of that forbidden 1900s something movie. It was never intended to be that.Ignore what all the critics say, this movie isn't for them, it's for all of us Nintendo fans. They don't recognize all of the heartwarming characteristics that fans will.","

I have played few Super Mario games, but several of them are recognizable, from the oldest to the youngest.I hope that the animation studio follows these steps and does not give up before others who want to put marketing that is not permissible for minors. Thank you, universal, for remembering that many of us want to go to the movies to entertain ourselves.","

"blanbrn","11 April 2023","Remember as a kid I played my ""NES"" system till I had callus 's on my thumb and my first and favorite game was the classic original ""Super Mario Bros."". I loved and mastered it by recusing the princess and going thru and defeating the evil Bowser inside the castle. It was nice getting help from Lugi and jumping on turtles, and toads, yet getting power and energy from mushrooms by busting brick and traveling thru pipes and escaping to different worlds was magical. Finally with the popularity a movie version has been made for the big screen and it's nice seeing Mario and his friends animated as they look cool and fun it's a nice adventure that brings back fun memories from when I was a kid. And the voice work from Charlie Day, Anna Taylor Joy, and Jack Black was good hope to see more big screen video game like movies.","

It is a masterpiece of greatness. Especially the musical score. Nintendo creates the perfect video game movie. Princess Peach, Toad, other amazing characters are too great. Super Mario has done its job. Great Easter eggs and references. I love this movie.Bowser song about Princess Peach, truly amazing voice from Jack Black. It defines Bowser's character especially how his motivations shows. Can't wait for the sequel and I hope we can explore and expand the Mario universe.","

"jonpovey","5 April 2023","A Joyless, humourless, plotless waste of time.The plot would be barely adequate for a 15 minute afternoon cartoon. Incredibly predictable and barely functions as a way to string together pretty dull set pieces from the games.No emotion, no jokes, just nothing. Even seeing it on imax didn't help. There just seemed to be nothing new or imaginative here and certainly nothing to keep adults entertained.But even 9 year old was bored and gave it a 5/10 before I even said a single thing about the movie.I gave it a 3, which is probably too high.Just stay home and play the games, a lot more fun.","

"theredsky","26 July 2023","This is easily Illumination's best movie but that really isn't saying much. It's not a bad movie by any means but it really isn't that great either. The story is honestly the worst part of the film. It's very cliche and generic. You can pretty much predict every single beat before it happens and it really leaves a lot to be desired. I appreciate that it's paced quickly but I do also wish it would take more time to flesh out its ideas and themes because at the end of the day it really is a ""Do you remember this"" kind of movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing for this movie though as the references do show that the people involved did care about Mario as a character and wanted to honor him compared to something like The Flash which does the same thing except to get people in seats and not for the betterment of the film. As much I as like the references, I definitely wish it was toned down a little bit in order to make a more interesting story. The characters are just okay as well. The performances from okay to pretty good. Chris Pratt's Mario is nowhere near as bad as I thought he was going to be but he was just fine. Anya Taylor-Joy was okay as Peach and most of the rest of the cast is okay. Jack Black as Bowser was perfect casting though and he was easily the best part of the film. The music was also very well done. It takes a bunch of classic Mario themes and gives them an orchestral and cinematic spin to them which I really appreciated. The soundtrack choices were god awful though and really took away from the scenes. Was playing ""Take On Me"" really necessary? The animation was also fairly good as well. It wasn't incredible but compared to Illumination's other films, it definitely feels like there was a lot of effort into making the film look good. As much as I have criticized this movie, I still think it's very fun. I did enjoy myself while watching the movie and even though I think it could have been so much better, I still walked out content with what I saw. If you like Mario then I'd probably recommend it but don't expect a masterpiece.","

"OnlySethDavis","4 August 2023","I love the animation style. The plot is not that great but the voice acting I found distracting. I know I'm supposed to pretend like this was a great film but I can't. I love Jack black but not as bowser. The silly dumbed down quirky villain this movie makes him out to be is forgettable and cringy. There were some funny moments. Mostly coming from bowser's assistant. But overall, this movie just isn't good in my personal opinion and it definitely isn't something I'd ever watch again. I hope everyone can find something to love about it and if you think it's great, I think that's awesome. But I was expecting more and got way less.","

"paulclaassen","26 May 2023","Oh, how utterly delightful! 'Mario Bros' happens to be one of my all-time favourite console games, so it goes without saying that I was excited when I saw the release of 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie'.The film revolves around brothers Mario and Luigi who just started their own plumbing business. Due to their size, however, everyone is making fun of them. When hear on television about a huge water leak flooding streets of Brooklyn, they decide to go underground to fix it. Attempting to fix the leak, they are sucked through a porthole to another dimension. Mario ends up in the bright and colourful Mushroom Kingdom, while Luigi lands in the foreboding Dark Lands.As it turns out, these two kingdoms are at war - The Mushroom Kingdom being ruled by the fair, human princess Peach, while Dark Lands is ruled by a giant turtle called Bowser. He plans on taking over the Mushroom Kingdom and marrying the princess, even though she hates him. But if she doesn't, he will destroy her kingdom.The brothers reluctantly becomes involved in the feud, and the result is loads of action, adventure and humour. I absolutely love the beautiful animation. All the characters - from the protagonists to the antagonist - are very well set-up. The film cleverly brings the game to life, remaining true to the game - complete with actual sound effects. This is a wonderful film young and old can enjoy, and to watch again and again. If you're a fan of the game, you'll enjoy it even more. Chances are, if you have the console game (as I do) you're probably going to want to play the game afterwards. I loved it!","

Expect for the Despicable me movies they at least have good story telling and characters are fun.However, I have to say this is very fun movie there's alot of references from pervious mario games I enjoyed the original video game music in places in. The dynamic between mario and luigi is nice at beginning but I didn't like how Luigi is completely gone for most of movie so Mario and Peach have bond it was very non existence only one scene with fire flower.Jack Black as Bowser is best part of the film his voice performance fits and I like the song number he did about Peach I also did like Charlie Day as Luigi it was fine no complaints. Chris Pratt I feel is very hit and miss with voice not awful but not great just ok.Seth Rogen as DK wasn't best didn't like the jokes and dialogue felt awkward and he sounded like he didn't care or try not best choice thats same Fred armisen as Cranky Kong he didn't sound like the character and wasn't Cranky either.Peach and Toad voice acting was fine didn't bother me and I didn't like 80s music was there as well either pick game music or normal music.Overall, great animation looks fantastic and music is great its fun with references in pervious games but plot could have been better it was fast pace and I wish Luigi has more screen time as well with Mario but Seth Rogen was worst part in my opinion.Its worth watching if you like mario games great for fans.","

"johnspringer-95440","11 April 2023","The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a colorful, fun animated adventure that aims to please fans of the long-running videogame franchise and largely succeeds. It's not as good as the recent Puss In Boots sequel, but it's still a charming adventure. Following on the heels of Puss In Boots, Super Mario is also the second tentpole family movie in a row to focus on pleasing families rather than digit media critics. As Maddy Myers of Polygon notes (to her horror), Super Mario doesn't contain a single scene in which the title character appears in women's clothes. Mario's also not an incompetent buffoon, there's no bait-and-switch to make Princess Peach the flawless protagonist, Princess Peach isn't voiced by Megan Markle, and Bowser isn't a misunderstood hero intended to teach 8-year-olds about moral relativism. What is this subversive madness? A pendulum swing back to entertaining entertainment, perhaps?","

"CinemaClown","8 July 2023","Jam-packed with nods, references & easter eggs yet nowhere near half as intriguing, riveting & enjoyable as the video game source, The Super Mario Bros. Movie serves as the origin story for the most famous character in both Nintendo canon & video game industry as a whole but it is a serviceable at best offering that fails to offer an adventure worth investing into.Directed by Michael Jelenic & Aaron Horwath, the story follows Mario after he is transported to an alternate world with his brother Luigi where they become entangled in a battle between two rival kingdoms. There are plenty of nostalgic touches & callbacks here but its plot is paper thin, characterisation is bland and despite the vibrant animation, the interest isn't entirely piqued.The film is more geared towards children and doesn't have enough for the adult fans who grew up playing the video game as evident in its juvenile quality, childish humour & cartoonish touch. And then there is Chris Pratt who proves himself to be a terrible choice for Mario's voice. Jack Black is the only one who impresses and though the rest aren't awful, they aren't up to the mark either.Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is an occasionally entertaining yet mostly underwhelming offering that does brim with colour but it is also lacking in narrative aspects. Those expecting the ride to be along the lines of The Lego Movie or even Wreck-It Ralph are in for a disappointment as there isn't much happening under the surface in what's a rather straightforward adaptation. In short, forgettable.","

"AdamBrad003","4 August 2023","I've got to say, it was a lot of fun. I mean, I wasn't expecting too much, but it pleasantly surprised me. It's got all of those classic elements from the Super Mario games we all love - the iconic characters, the familiar locations, and even the gameplay. It's a nostalgic trip down to memory lane! I still remember those 'simpler days' when I used to spend all of my time off playing Super Mario Bros. 3 and Yoshi's Island. Those were the best times, and this movie totally brought me back to those golden moments.First off, the visuals were absolutely fantastic! Like they jumped straight out of the games, It's impressive how accurate and colorful everything was. The animation by Ilumination was by far their best work yet. But what I loved the most was that the movie captured that special feel, the essence of what makes Mario so iconic. It's what made this movie stand out and be really great.The film was packed with easter eggs, and let me tell you, there were a bunch of them! I was thrilled to spot most of it and was happy to see how familiar they were. The classic soundtrack/effects was an absolute winner. It was a direct blast from the past, bringing back all those nostalgic feels. They nailed it, no doubt. Some of the songs were unnecessary and didn't always fit the scenes perfectly, but somehow, someway, i guess it worked.As for the cast, it was a mixed bag... Chris Pratt as Mario was... yeah, you know, it's not that I'm hating on the guy, to be honest, he doesn't exactly sound like Mario, but he did a decent job (Still an odd choice). Charlie Day as Luigi was way more convincing. Jack Black as Bowser was the highlight. He absolutely nailed it! Him and Lumalee were my favorite characters in this movie. Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, Anya-Taylor Joy as Princess Peach, and Keegan-Michael Key as Toad and the rest of the cast, all did a solid job.Now, every movie has its issues, and this one's no exception. The problem here was that the plot felt like it got lost in the warp pipe - seriously, it was thin as hell. Some of the character decisions felt a bit too convenient and rushed, like Mario meeting Toad and becoming BFFs right away and Peach barely bats an eye when Mario breaks into her crib. Like, who the heck is this dude, and why isn't she questioning it? And they go ""Let's go save the world!"" - In like two lines of dialogue, they're ready to take on the universe!Character development? Yeah, not much of that going on. We wanted to see some growth, some depth, but sadly, it felt lacking. And the lack of effort in providing the backstory and context we need for these beloved worlds and characters. Seriously, we've been invested in this universe for ages, and they could've given us more...Also, the pacing was crazy fast. It felt like they were speedrunning the whole movie, trying to pack in as much as they could. Feels like they were rushing to get to the next scene as fast as possible. That's some of the few complaints I had.I believe they could've done so much more. But, I'm not disappointed at all. Like I mentioned earlier, I wasn't exactly expecting a cinematic masterpiece from a movie based on a video game. Still, it was pretty entertaining and it had some great moments, despite a short runtime. So, all I can really say is, it's definitely worth a watch.","

Finally a movie that just made a great movie out of a great story and didn't ruin it by gender or race swapping the main characters or having to worry about including lgbtq scenes to check the boxes like everything disney has put out the past decade. Great homage to the mario games all throughout this movie. At first the mario voice was concerning but easily got over it withing a minute. Not sure how jack black's song for peach won a grammy or whatever he won, wasn't a very good song honestly. Good cinematography aswell with the way they shot the scenes to replicate the video game feel.","

"Mikes-94081","8 April 2023","It was a nostalgic film even down to the actual mario Italian accent in some places without being too much. No complaints. No dull moments. Seats filled pretty fast where we went. My only complaint is on me for not buying the tickets early for all of us to sit together. It was a very good adaptation of turning a classic game into a watchable movie. In my opinion, i dont think they pulled any punches making this film and I would definitely not mind seeing it a second time in the theaters. Even down to memorable video game moments. Applauding at the credits too! Great move to take the kids to see.","

"HeyimShibby","14 May 2023","Today I watched the Mario movieThis feels like an AI generated film that has as much flavor as water with a side of wheat bread.The Story was bland, predictable, and 40 minutes of it could have been completely removed and it would have flowed nearly the same exact way.The voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it was still not good tbh. Jack black did great, that's about it.The music was repellent. It was wallpaper orchestral nothing music with a hint of mario. Truly the mario flavored lacroix of music. Also they played a super mario galaxy song at the incorrect time which was weird.Overall this movie sucked. It was a dull kids movie that made me chuckle 4 times. Mostly was just annoyed by how soulless this was. Oh well illumination sucks. It was well animated and I guess it was cohesive but what was it in service of...?High 3/10 or Low 4/10.",NA
"redismycolor-51707","10 January 2024","It's funny, I didn't expect anything from Sonic the movie for example and I was pleasantly surprised by his bias in a mix of reality that could be really tough (With the Sonic design of the first trailer, we were close to disaster, and fortunately there was an incredible Jim Carrey), at least Sonic had the intelligence to make his character live with a real excited teen journey and send a message close to the game about the dangers of robotics (even if they forgot the ecology which was a bit the center of the game in terms of theme but hey it doesn't matter). As much this time, I expected to be more of Super Mario surely because of its side of animation of synthesis which has the ability to go in all directions without taking too much risk, especially with such a crazy universe, approaching Pixar even... Without taking too much risk... Well here I think I found the bottom of my mind.No actually it's even worse in truth: Super Mario Bros take absolutely no risk and he is even so afraid to make a meatball, that he develops absolutely nothing, apart from its beginning with the family of Mario which is maybe his best passage with a TV ad like Ghostbuster very year 80. The rest? A horribly banal story that barely holds water, never develops any character and offers absolutely nothing interesting. We witness a long cinematic punctuated non-stop musical sketch without any inventiveness. It makes you smile sometimes, but it's too easy to be really funny.On the visual side however it is absolutely beautiful, really and the film offers some nice wink in the video game in the staging that fortunately allows us to hold a little, the music is also very successful by offering a super medley of all the themes of the games. And that's about it because my god the story is tasteless, the origin of Peach for example could have been the engine, but it is barely mentioned and very quickly the film sends the following message: or does not care, run everywhere.In fact I believe that the two best characters are Toad and the blue star of Harmony (the I do not have his name) for their crazy side precisely but nothing exceptional, the others are archetypes ultra basic as in the games. Well we can say that it is faithful on one side but, in general, we expect a little more of a film in the cinema. No surprises in the program, a film only for fans who has absolutely nothing to say and therefore no interest.It is even so uninteresting this story that the film is forced to make its heroes invincible with a star at the end to try to conclude something. And now they are plumbers again, but in the mushroom kingdom... But wait, they needed a plumber in the mushroom kingdom? No, they don't fix pipes in games that I know of?In short it makes no sense and past the discovery, we will quickly forget this 1:30 cinematic.",NA
"balthesaur","22 April 2023","'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is the story of Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (voiced by Charlie Day), who are two struggling plumbers in Brooklyn. When an extremely complicated plumbing emergency arises in the middle of the city, the heroes are sucked through a mysterious green pipe and sent to a mythical new world, full of strange new allies and rivals. Befriended by Toad (voiced by Keegan-Michael Key), Mario is escorted to Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy), who tell him that she needs help from the evil Bowser (voiced by Jack Black).Visually, this movie is great! It's very colorful and well animated - which is to be expected coming from the Illumination studio. The script is fairly interesting, if a bit convoluted, but there are enough jokes and funny moments to make the movie entertaining.Worth a watch, especially with kids!",NA
