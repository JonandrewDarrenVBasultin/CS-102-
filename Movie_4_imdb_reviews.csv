"imseeg","3 July 2023","What do the haters complain about? And why you should still watch this final edition.1 The first Indiana Jones editions were the best.This new edition has got the same spirit, the same amount of action, the same amount of adventure and I loved it (almost) as much as the early editions.2 The leading actress Phoebe is a disaster.My personal opinion is that she aint bad at all. She shines. And dont forget she doesnt have to carry this movie, Harrison Ford does.3 Harrison Ford has gotten old and grumpy.Correct. He has been always grumpy! And yes, he has gotten old and director James Mangold shows Indiana's old age in all of it's demise AND glory. Respect!4 There are no jokes. It's too serious with too many killings.Rubbish. There are still enough good jokes, but not the ""in your face"" jokes we were used to. But I love the more subtle, indirect jokes.It is more serious though and I LIKE IT. Even an adventure needs some serious notes, to be more credible. And by the way, I am not a kid anymore and so arent many other Indiana fans!5 Steven Spielberg didnt direct it.But James Mangold did and whoever googles Mangold's Imdb carreer, soon will find out this director has made some fabulous movies. I applaud his direction!I loved this edition. It had everything I needed in an adventure packed movie. It thrilled me. It made me laugh. And the final scenes really TOUCHED me and gave me goosebumps. I had a wonderful time watching this last edition!Just another solidly made Indiana Jones flick. Enjoy the show!Thank you for reading my 2000 th review on Imdb.","

"thejefflewis-92228","1 July 2023","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite movie. I did not feel that ""Dial of Destiny"" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. ""Dial of Destiny"" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like ""Dial of Destiny"", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.","

"reelreviewsandrecommendations","17 July 2023","It is 1944 and adventuring archaeologist Indiana Jones is in a familiar predicament: the Nazis have caught him attempting to scupper their nefarious plans. After breaking free of their vile clutches, Jones and his accomplice Basil Shaw discover the fascists have found the Antikythera mechanism, a device created by Archimedes that supposedly reveals time fissures. Jones escapes, foils the enemy's schemes and steals the mechanism- seemingly putting the matter to bed. Some 25 years later, however, Jones is thrust back into action when his goddaughter Helena comes looking for the Antikythera; with an underground group of die-hard Nazis on her tail. Will Jones and Helena manage to save the day before time runs out?Directed by James Mangold and written alongside Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an uneven sendoff to one of the greatest characters in film history, that all too often feels like it came from the 'paint by numbers' school of filmmaking. Mangold tries throughout to recapture the magic of the original trilogy of Jones pictures, and occasionally succeeds; such as in the thrilling opening set in 1944, or a touching reunion between Indy and his estranged love at the end of the film. Furthermore, it is consistently enjoyable watching Harrison Ford on screen as Indy once more, even if he is a more downcast fellow this time; and the odd reference to adventures past is sure to make fans of the series grin from ear to ear.However, the narrative is weak, the characterization of secondary characters is scant at best and- weirdly- at times it seems as if Indy is the sidekick in his own film. Helena Shaw, from the moment she comes on screen, is treated as the real star of the show, despite her being a decidedly unlikable lady. A spoiled and arrogant heiress, she is constantly rude and dismissive of Indy, when she isn't being reckless and impulsive, putting herself and others in danger for her own selfish motives. As written, the character has little to no respect for history or culture, seeing everything as a means to an end. She contrasts starkly with Indy, whose humble respect for his profession and legacy endears him to audiences. Helena, on the other hand, is a self-centered cad, who tries to upstage our hero at every turn. Why Mangold thought she should be made the (arguable) central character when this is Indy's last outing is beyond comprehension, not to mention being irritating and disrespectful to a cinematic legend.Alas, Mangold's poor characterization isn't confined to her alone. 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' not only provides us with a discount Short Round in the form of Helena's associate Teddy- a kid more irritating than mischievous- but a discount Major Toht too, in the form of Professor Voller- a Nazi scientist so generic even the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen can't make him interesting. Neither of these new iterations of old characters are very compelling, nor well rounded; and their inclusion in the film feels like a desperate attempt to out-do and re-create times gone by. Furthermore, the few familiar faces that occasionally pop up feel shoehorned into the plot, and Voller's troupe of henchmen are bland and forgettable.Unfortunately, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' contains underwhelming visuals as well, which look cheap compared to the likes of 'Raiders' or 'The Last Crusade.' Much like with the previous 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', there is a phony digital sheen to everything on screen that takes one out of the movie completely, and the questionable CGI is jarring throughout. Comparing the first three movies with the last two, it seems digital processes don't fit an Indiana Jones vehicle, they are the kind of epics that demand to be shot on film with practical effects. Moreover, the exaggerated effects and artificiality of proceedings hamper whatever realism Mangold was trying to foster with his downbeat narrative and allusions to real world history.The main problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' though, is its lack of originality or charm, which the previous films- well, the first three, anyway- had in spades. Mangold seems content to rely on recycled tropes and clichés to forward the story, making this adventure feel like familiar ground instead of fresh fun. The film uses the similar formula of Nazis, ancient artifacts, exotic locations and supernatural elements that we have seen before, but without the wit, creativity and excitement that made them memorable; meaning this iteration of Indy comes as more of a whimper than a bang.Are there some elements deserving of praise in the film? Of course. Harrison Ford is consistently excellent and engaging as Indy, carrying the adventure squarely on his shoulders with his usual ease and charm. Furthermore, John Williams' epic score is stirring and- though her character is unlikable- Phoebe Waller-Bridge brings a nice blend of snark and enthusiasm to proceedings, sharing a good chemistry with Ford. Had they a better script to work with- and if Mangold's characterization wasn't so one-dimensional- they might have made a memorable duo. Additionally, the action is generally well realized- though tends towards the overblown- and there are moments and batches of dialogue that'll have fans of the series entertained, even if they are a bit few and far between.However, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' just isn't great. As an adventure movie, it is too downbeat, and as a final entry in a fantastic series, it is too weak narratively to make much impact. Though it makes for a better overall package than 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' it's not by much. The character of Helena Shaw is hard to warm to, the villains are forgettable and the visuals are underwhelming. In short, Indy, Ford and the fans deserved a better movie than 'The Dial of Destiny,' a muddled misadventure proving that time waits for no man; not even Indiana Jones.","

"DarkVulcan29","30 June 2023","I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end.","

"slightlymad22","28 June 2023","I just got out of Indiana Jones & The Dial of DestinyThey have only gone and done it!! They have made a dull, boring Indiana Jones movie!! This is going to pain me to write.It started out great (the first 20 minutes or so) then it's just very meh as it really drags to its ending!! If you don't like what Mangold did to Logan in Logan, you won't like what he has done to Indiana Jones here. He is an old, grumpy; miserable, very depressed alcoholic, who bores his students to sleep and he has retirement forced on him.The chase sequences are clearly green screen and CGI and it really stands out!! It never feels real.Ford is game, and almost everything he does in this movie is believable. John Williams score is the best thing about this movie.Phoebe Waller Bridge is just one annoying woman, I never bought their relationship for one second, nothing feels real. None of her jokes landed and in the full movie, there was only one laugh in my screening and that was during a Raiders of The Lost Ark call back.Mads Mickelson is as reliable as ever. He always delivers, so no complaints here.It pains me to say, I'll probably never watch it again. Now it's time to drink away my disappointment.","

"CinemaClown","3 July 2023","The fifth & final instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise and also the first to not be helmed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny brings the famous archaeologist back for one final outing yet finishes as a bland & bloated blockbuster that fails to replicate the magic & bravado of its predecessors despite having all the necessary ingredients at its disposal.Co-written & directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the film opens with a thrilling & action-packed prologue that brings the titular artefact into play but then it follows it up with a series of events that just unfold with a straightforward monotonousness. Despite being the final chapter, it doesn't have the urgency, even the exposition is lame, and the action set pieces lack flavour.What makes the ride dull is the same rinse-n-repeat approach that surface throughout the film in addition to it not having any genuine sense of danger or adventure or escalation. Humour is often poorly timed and the picture also fails to provide John Williams any moment to allow his music to soar. Harrison Ford manages to hold his own in spite of the frailty in his performance but the rest are forgettable.Overall, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny begins on a promising note but gets bogged down by issues of its own makings. Most of the problems plaguing this latest sequel can be found in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too but even that disparaged entry employed better use of shots, cuts & outrageous set pieces. This one fares somewhat better as a whole but it is still a lifeless, overlong & mediocre offering.","

"themarvelheroeslildoop","3 July 2023","The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was. I hated her in this movie.","

"ferguson-6","29 June 2023","Greetings again from the darkness. ""They look like snakes."" It's such a simple line of dialogue, yet after 42 years and four previous movies, we know exactly what that means to retiring archaeology professor, Dr. Henry Jones, best known to all as the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. As the final chapter of the beloved franchise, this entry is the first one not directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg (listed here as an Executive Producer). Instead, James Mangold takes the reins, and also shares writing credit with his frequent collaborators Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth, as well as ""Indiana Jones"" veteran David Koepp. Of course, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman receive credit for their original characters.Harrison Ford once again dons the familiar whip and hat, and at 80 years of age, still possesses the screen persona and magnetism that first won us over in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The extended and frenetic opening sequence finds a young Indy (Ford is digitally de-aged for the sequence) at the tail end of WWII fighting Nazis over what else, a prized ancient artifact. I'll leave the specifics to those who watch the film, but just know that it's an interesting historical choice, and also one that matters little in relation to the enjoyment of the film.Working alongside Indy in the opening sequence is his pal and fellow archaeologist, Basil Shaw (talented character actor Toby Jones, who seems to be in most movies these days). However, the fun part for me is seeing Thomas Kretschmann and Mads Mikkelsen share scenes as Nazi Colonel Weber and Dr. Voller, respectively. These are two of my favorite actors and I do wish they had a couple more exchanges ... although Mikkelsen's character gets significant screen time and plays a crucial role in how the story unfolds and concludes (he is also digitally de-aged for the opening sequence).The story picks up with modern day Dr Voller and his band of misfits tracking down the relic and disturbing Dr. Jones' retirement party. It's at this point where Indy's Goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pops up creating a three-way battle for the priceless relic. This sets off a chain of events that leads them on a global trek to desert, sea, and hallowed cities of antiquity. Helena's partner in crime is young Teddy (Ethann Isidore, sporting a Bob Griese Dolphins jersey), who is clearly the scrappiest of the bunch. Dr Voller's troupe includes Shaunetta Renee Wilson as the misguided Mason, Brad Holbrook as sleazy Klaber, and Olivier Richters as one of the largest bodyguards you've ever seen.Fans of the franchise know that the story is secondary to the characters and action, and there is no shortage of action on speeding trains, galloping horses, motorcycles, tuk tuks, vintage airplanes, and scuba dives. Antonio Banderas shows up as a boat-owning old friend of Indy, but it's the appearance of series favorites John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, and Karen Allen as Marion, that generated cheers from the audience. Ms. Waller-Bridge holds her own with screen legend Ford, and it will be interesting to see the career path she chooses after her success on TV and now film. At times this feels like a live action cartoon, and that's not meant as criticism. It's pure fun, fantasy, and adventure cloaked in nostalgia; and the film is a fitting conclusion to a world class franchise.Opens in theaters June 30, 2023.","

"benjaminskylerhill","30 June 2023","I understand some of the criticisms I've heard surrounding this final Jones outing; it's burdened by a handful of excessively bizarre ideas and an overabundance of characters.But one criticism I'll never understand is that this is somehow disrespectful toward the Indiana Jones character-that it belittles him or mocks him in some way. I could not agree less with this.What I saw today was a film made by a director who understands, respects, and loves this character. He crafted a hearty adventure story that adds depth to Jones and sends him off fondly.Indiana and Helena are characters that are both shown to be capable, intelligent, and protective and they both save each other quite often. They are introduced as closed-off but they wear each others' emotional layers down over the course of the story in subtle, natural ways that really did affect me and make me feel something.The film is shot and directed immaculately-the action is brisk yet hard and thrilling. Sure, the story's ambition requires a LOT of CGI, and it's more noticeable than it should be at times.But that didn't stop me from loving the film because the script is smart, constantly shifting power dynamics and developing character to keep you invested in the world.This is leagues better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I really hope people avoid the hate train that's been building online and give this last adventure a chance in theaters.","

"Cinema-reviewer321","7 July 2023","I love Raiders of the Lost Ark from 1981, I like the second movie Temple of Doom from 1984, but I like the first movie more, I love the movie The Last Crusade from 1989 as much as the first movie, but I like it more than the second movie, and I thought the fourth movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from 2008 was mediocre, with the first three movies being better. The fifth and last movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was good and a good ending to the character, with it being better than the fourth movie, and little better than the second movie, but I still think the first and third movie is better.Despite his age, Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones many years later; he is retiring from his job, and he is watching how the world changes around him since his younger years. Going on this last adventure to find something a friend of his was looking for, and to stop the villain from getting his hands on it, while also dealing with his goddaughter who wants it for her own reasons. I like how Indy is getting tired of doing what he is doing but also still has some love for adventure, he was also good in action scenes in the certain places they go to.Indy's goddaughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not bad, I would have liked more done with her character by showing how she became the way she is, or how she could have learned certain things that are useful on the adventure, along with her sidekick named Teddy who was like Short Round from Temple of Doom. I liked the main villain Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen; his plan involving the Dial was interesting with his plans with the Nazis, and that he has a backstory involving an interaction with Indiana Jones; he was not much of an archaeologist, he knew and used math more to use in his plan that involves time.The opening involves a de-aged Harrison Ford that does look good, but sometimes the voice can sound older than he looked but also it would fit. The opening was great, it looked like the original movies and felt like them with a great action sequence that also sets up the main villain; all the action scenes are fun, nicely shot, suspenseful, and fast paced. Director James Mangold did a wonderful job giving this movie the same look and feel as the original movies directed by Steven Spielberg. The locations or caves they go through look cool, and interesting on how they tie to major points in history.The third act will divide some people, but because of other weird things that happen in the earlier movies, it was not that hard to believe; leading to an ending that is sweet and a nice end for the character. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was a nice ending that had callbacks to the earlier movies, great action, a fantastic musical score from John Williams, and Harrison Ford giving his all in his last movie as this famous character. This movie is not flawless, but I had fun with it, and I think fans will too.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","4 October 2023","Poor, how many of us grew up loving Harrison Ford's Indie? The super cool action hero, brave and fearless, with a sense of humour... that wasn't the character I saw here.The first fifteen minutes or so, I loved, it felt like a scene from Temple of Doom, terrific, action packed, a heroic Indie, sadly the rest of the film very, very poor. I came away from the cinema feeling depressed, he's now a sad character, but fear not, Helena, the epitome of privilege will save the day.Horrible CGI effects, way too many, some of them looked awful, I can't believe some of the scenes made it through to the final cut.Ford put his usual effort in, how sad though that Indie ended this way, Disney you've well and truly done it again, that's another much loved franchise sent down the pan.I get the appeal of Fleabag, but Phoebe Waller Bridge was totally miscast, Helena was just loathsome, conceited, arrogant, too smarmy, what on Earth were they thinking?I'm genuinely stunned at how positive some of the reviews are for this movie, having recently watched Temple of Doom, and loving every minute, then watching this mess.....Sorry, I thought this was abysmal. It should have been a fun send off, instead is was just depressing.3/10.","

"Flak36","29 June 2023","I just returned from the theatre and now I finally have my own opinion after so many mixed reviews. Those who hate it exaggerate just as they did with Crystal Skull.I know that nobody asked for a fifth movie. But they made one and fortunately for us it's good. It truly is and it doesn't have to be perfect.There were three or four moments where I didn't like Helen. I believe the vast majority of fans know what I'm talking about and agree with it. The rest of the movie is fantastic, including the opening action sequence in 1944 with the de-ageing.The finale was something I would never have guessed and I loved it. No spoilers. If you're like me and you're worried that this movie might suck go watch it. You will enjoy it.","

"SoumikBanerjee1996","4 September 2023","Indiana Jones movies were not always about the action or the grandeur, and they also showcased significant character dynamics, convincing comedic punches and, most importantly, the quirky, over-the-top nature imbued deeply in their expositions.All the things that this newer reboot/expansion has missed out on.Now, many might argue that modern-day filmmaking necessitates a modern-day approach and new-age sensibilities, and I could have agreed to that had it not been a part of a widely celebrated franchise!When you think of an expansion, taking the reins of a beloved series, you're obliged to give the audience a fan service. There's only so much room available for amendments. I like James Mangold as a director and adored some of his previous works (Logan, Ford vs. Ferrari). I do believe he's a capable filmmaker, but he hadn't done justice here.The kind of comedy that I treasured during my visits to the previous entries of the series was nowhere to be found. Phoebe Waller-Bridge seemed like a misfit in this universe, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the pacing was also horrendous. The 150 minutes of runtime occasionally wears you down; you would feel the stretch of time, and that's not a good indication.The only positives to take away from this film are the barrage of action blocks and Mr. Jones himself. I've always cheered for Mr. Ford in this character, and I genuinely believe he was born to play this role, and he does play it effortlessly every time. This was no exception. It's such a pleasure to watch him play this character.We will miss you, Indy!","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","30 June 2023","With a heavy heart, I think I have to concede that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not good. It's probably even bad, because even the parts that are sort of entertaining ultimately disappoint.Take for example the prologue with a de-aged Harrison Ford. The technology used to do it is impressive, and only looked awkward in a couple of shots for me. It's Indy adventuring during the end of World War II, and it almost captures the adventure/action you'd want. However, it's so dimly lit that barely anything can be seen. It's probably to disguise the de-aging, but it's disappointing. The stuff you can see isn't particularly great, but it fares better than the next couple of big action scenes.These are spaced out over the next 80 to 90 minutes. Said 80 to 90-minute stretch is honestly very boring. Harrison Ford is trying, and John Williams' score is pretty good. I usually like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, but her character didn't work for me. Barely any of the humor landed. The action is incredibly dull and quite often poorly shot. Ford himself isn't in much of the action, which is understandable, but it also begs the question of why they even bothered trying to make an action movie with an 80-year-old man.I swear characters enter a hotel at night, and they come out the front door five minutes later and it's the middle of the day. Why did they bring John Rhys-Davies back without giving him anything to do? Why was Antonio Banderas in this for like, five minutes? Why do they think audiences will care that Banderas and Toby Jones play ""friends"" of Indiana Jones, even if they've never been seen or mentioned before this film? Why does Hollywood keep wasting Mads Mikkelsen?The final half-hour is sort of fun, but it concludes very abruptly and awkwardly. Some people will hate where the movie goes regardless, but I thought it came close to giving the whole thing a pulse. The final scene itself sounds like it should work on paper, but it did nothing for me emotionally. As I walked home, I liked the movie less and less, the more I thought about it.It's so lifeless and uninspired, and even if maybe a third of it is passable, the rest is a combination of boring and baffling. Even if you're a big fan of the series, I wouldn't bother. This is a good deal worse than the other four.","

"cricketbat","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it's still completely unnecessary. I consider Dial of Destiny to be a second chance at an appendix to Indy's story. The plot of this movie never seems to get out of second gear. In fact, I was surprised when I realized the climax of the film had passed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is fine in her role, but she seems to be trying to steal the spotlight at times. And while the de-aging visual effect has improved, it just doesn't look quite right. For me, Indiana Jones is still a trilogy that concludes with the Last Crusade.","

"boblipton","9 July 2023","I had a great time looking at this movie, until I started to think about it and what it meant. Here's 81-year-old Harrison Ford portraying 65-year-old Indiana Jones in feats of derring-do that would have put me in the hospital, if I was lucky, at 30. The movie was preceded by coming attractions of movies that feature 70-year-old Liam Neeson taking on a maniac who has planted bombs everywhere, and sixty-two year old Tom Cruise saving the world and his wife by running very fast and jumping a motorcycle off a cliff, even though the mission is impossible.I am old enough to remember when Clark Gable did his own stunts in THE MISFITS, and promptly died of a heart attack. He was fifty-nine when he died. It's certainly true that people can keep active and healthy and relatively youthful looking longer than they used to. Neither do I expect any sensible movie star to say ""Certainly I am fit and quite able to do this, but keep your tens of millions of dollars, Mr. Producer."" Likewise, the movie industry hasn't come up with much in the way of fresh ideas since W. K. L. Dickson directed BLACKSMITH SCENE in 1893. Nor should they. Their job is to take hundreds of millions of dollars, shepherd them through the movie-making process like Oscar Meyer moving cow parts through the frankfurter-making process, and come out with something north of however much moolah went in. Since at least 1893, audiences have demonstrated time and again that originality serves little to no purpose in the effort. The wise producer has taken heed.And so, men -- and women, since Jane Fonda has been forced from retirement -- who should be spending their golden years enjoying their well-earned leisure, or engaging in roles that reflect the wisdom and dignity, and even problems that used to accrue to our elders to so do -- continue to pretend to run fast, get shot, and bounce back like rubber balls. And why do they do it? Because the producers keep offering them absurd sums of money. And the producers do that because we, the movie-going public, insist on it. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proven himself a smart and wise enough guy to get himself elected governor of California, and remains a voice of reason, passion, compassion, and love of democracy in our often fraught times. Yet he's still in demand in the movies, but only as a cigar-chomping tough guy toting a machine gun like it's a pea shooter and intoning ""I'll be back.""He shouldn't have to. He only does it because many people, my age and younger, refuse to admit that we're getting older, and it's time to put away the juvenile fantasies that amused us when we were fourteen. Haven't we grown tired of sniggering at the same things over and over again? Haven't we grown up at all? Don't new problems and pleasures occupy us, or did we cease to grow more than half a century ago? Must the same people put on the same costumes and perform the same roles yet again, because we insist on being adolescents until they drag all our corpses from our Assisted Living facilities and dispose of the remains in whatever fashion is fashionable?No, this is a very enjoyable movie. But until we, the movie-watching public decide to grow up, neither will the movies.","

Wow!Sometimes, as a producer, you should finish the product, then watch it and decide not to release it out of self respect.Even The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull couldn't ruin the legacy for me but Phoebe Waller Bridge managed to do it in 5 minutes.A young Harrison Ford CGI dubbed by the actual one was just tragic.","

C. or seated at The Last Supper for THE LAST CRUSADE, well, then...To give one small thing away with DIAL OF DESTINY would blow the entire cover, but basically new helmer James Mangold deliberately makes the Steven Spielberg action-directing-playbook a helluva lot noisier and way more needlessly violent: anyone helping-out the now extremely-aged and initially grouchy Jones will wind up quickly dead, making those random map-scattered characters not matter much beyond moving the bombastic adventure from one point to another -- in itself an important action-packed aspect which is often done decently enough...But the worst fan reviews have gone to the newest sidekick in Indiana's goddaughter played by the extremely tall and cocky Phoebe Waller-Bridge, actually more an attempted female version of the selfishly-driven RAIDERS French archeologist/middleman-heavy, Belloq, wanting fast cash for what's pricelessly meant as a museum artifact...Which is what Harrison Ford is at this point... an artifact... and the movie plays the old gruff sore-boned fella not only too much at times, but the randomly rejuvenated ""I've been doing this stuff all along"" hero doesn't seem very natural while, during various pockets of chase sequence escapades, the plot gets dizzy in a tiresome and complicated balancing act...Following the too-often-separated goals of Jones, the goddaughter Helena (with her own spry child sidekick, basically a sidekick's sidekick), and the central German Nazi, here played by Mads Mikkelsen, donning an omnipresent dull frown despite the usual Indy-villain obsession of obtaining the impossible by any means possible ie shadowing Jones since he always gets there first...Making DIAL ultimately feel more like a high-priced, multi-level video game (in particular the de-aged young Harrison Ford prologue) but that often feels maneuvered by a true franchise fan, trying their best to present a sky's-the-limit finale that ironically only works when it's not trying so hard to be... an INDIANA JONES movie.","

"redalfa147","4 February 2024","It was ok as a romp to not take seriously but it was spoilt by Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, Helena, who seemed to be smiling incessantly. Very 1-sided character I disliked, and given the amount of screen time, spoilt the movie.Chases were fun if not ridiculous: would three-wheeled vehicles be able to travel that fast round corners without toppling over?I felt many of the action sequences relied too heavily on computer generation making them feel unrealistic. Some of the vehicle manoeuvres and the shooting of the characters within them didn't ring true and took my attention away from the movie.Glad there weren't be anymore, even though I grew up with Raiders.","

"allmoviesfan","1 July 2023","So happy to have Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones - the iconic Indiana Jones - back on the big screen. Some impressive CGI work to make Indy a young man again as he battles the Nazis at the end of World War Two before events fast forward about twenty years, though the Nazis are still the bad guys. I've always said that Indiana Jones is at his best when battling the Nazis, and it is true again in the fifth and final instalment of the series. Indiana Jones is a world-weary, basically-retired archaeologist when he is roped into one last adventure, basically against his will. The fedora is there, the whip, the impish grin and the occasional one-liner. So are the big action set pieces that have made the series so popular, and I liked the nods to Father Time (which I guess no one can escape) that permeate the movie, as Indiana Jones looks to his future, whilst fighting a foe from his younger days, with a couple of well-designed cameos from familiar faces. A delight to sit in the cinema and watch a fitting conclusion to one of my favourite film series. Thoroughly enjoyed this.","

"FlashCallahan","4 July 2023","Daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.Accompanied by his goddaughter, and a wannabe Short-Round, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA, and his henchmen, one who looks like Pat Roach, and one who Mangold must like because he was the bad guy in Logan.....Did this film really need to be made? There are two camps in regards to this. For people who really disliked KOTCS, yes, because they wanted him to go out with a bang. And no, they should have left it with Last Crusade, and didn't really want to see Ford don the fedora one more time.Did I enjoy it?Through gritted teeth I say yes. But am I saying I enjoyed it because I love the franchise, and I can't bring myself to say it was a tad boring in places and I should have deserved it more because I grew up with Indiana Jones?Time will tell, which is ironic considering the maguffin.Ford as expected is brilliant, and we see a disillusioned, very different Indy in him. He's slightly bitter at the world because of something that happened a few years before, and he's weary, tired of everything around him, almost becoming an artefact himself, as he appears reluctant to accept the changing world around him.The first twenty minutes is truly astonishing, and up there with the best set pieces of the franchise, but still the poorest of all of the films openings. And unfortunately the de-aging effects are pretty poor, and the fact that his voice sounds older is jarring at times, and really puts you off at times. But once we are on the train, it goes full pelt.After that, it does go slightly downhill, and never reaches the heights of the opening. Waller-Bridge is a welcome addition to the franchise, and she holds her own against Ford, even though she can be slightly annoying at times. And she has her own Short-Round following her about. And guess what? They met the same way as Indy met Shorty.Mikkelsen is truly wonderful as the big evil, and he oozes menace and charm in equal measures. This is one great villain, and Mikkelsen knows that his character is brilliant.There is a really good chase sequence in the middle of the film, it's funny, pretty breathtaking, and harks back to the first three movies. Another highlight of the movie.But there are a few negatives.Banderas is wasted, and I feel that a lot of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. He barely has any lines, and the scenes we see him almost depict him as a very stupid person. Seeing that he is on the main posters for this just made me slightly annoyed, as he must only have about two minutes of screen time. It's a real problem for me, how ever trivial it may seem.Apart from one very touching scene, they reference the other films too bluntly, especially TOD, which is mentioned twice for some reason, and it's just a little cringey, especially when TOD is my favourite of the franchise (cinema trips with my dad we're golden days, that's why I love it).And then there is the final act. Depending on how you feel, this could be genius, or just plain stupid. But seeing as he has found the Holy Grail, The Ark of The Covenant, and dealt with aliens, I'll let it pass. But it's so random it will make you think 'really?' for a hot second.And one last thing, the film reminded me a little of Hudson Hawk. Both films have our heroes looking for different parts of an object across the world, and the object in question will change the world. But that's not a critique at all, just something I noticed.So all in all, it's a fun movie. A little slow at times, but I could not see a reason to cut anything from the film to make it a little shorter. It's not great, but die hard fans will get something out of this.A grower for sure.","

"petra_ste","2 July 2023","In The Monkey's Paw (spoilers for a 100 years old horror classic, I guess), the protagonists, after the death of a loved one, use a cursed artifact to bring him back, only to find a shambling undead monstrosity knocking at their door.Being a movie nerd in these days is a similar experience: the franchises you loved as a kid keep coming back, and for a while, maybe after a decent trailer, you are happy and optimistic... but then you see them and regret their return.In fact, Hollywood just can't let a beloved series end at the right moment. Alien should have ended with Aliens, and it got a diarrhea of terrible sequels, prequels and spin-offs; Terminator with T2, and I've lost count of the reboots; Star Wars with Return of the Jedi, and it got the awful sequels (I'm giving the prequels a pass because they at least tried to tell an interesting story)...... and, of course, Indiana Jones should have ended with The Last Crusade. It would have been an amazing trilogy (I have my issues with Temple of Doom but oh boys, is it looking better in retrospect), and now it has not one but two pointless sequels.So, is this one better or worse than Skull? I'd say more or less on par: not terrible and unwatchable but clunky and mediocre.Ford was my favorite actor as a kid (""Imagine being both Indy and Han Solo!""), and he gives it all here, but the sad truth is, he was already too old in Skull, and that was 15 years ago.Mangold is a solid director but Indy movies live and die on the strength of their set-pieces, and he isn't prime Steven Spielberg. Then again, who is? Not even Spielberg himself nowadays, since the set-pieces in Skull already sucked.Mangold keeps the camera too close so we do not get the geography of the action; his set-pieces are all momentum and no triumphant release. See the scene with the underwater relic and the eels, a cool premise which peters out into nothing. Also, the protagonists (especially Indy) rarely if ever do anything COOL to resolve the action - a crack of the whip, a last-second dive: they are just there, ping-ponging between different obstacles.Story construction is bloated, with pointless characters (the governative agents, the Moroccan mobster), setups without payoffs (""continental drift"") and endless tedious exposition: a scene with Waller-Bridge (moderately less annoying than I was expecting, but it was a low bar) smugly decrypting a tablet with a clue feels like the longest ten hours I've ever spent in a movie theater.Here's a hint, scriptwriters: characters dealing with treasure hunt clues is only interesting if we, the audience, can also SEE the clue and GUESS the possible answer. Otherwise, it's like watching someone on the bus mumble as he does his Sudoku, and you can't even peek over his shoulder.Dial of Destiny takes a weird turn in the last act and I sort of wish they had embraced the sheer cheesiness of it. I enjoyed a couple of scenes (the prologue is decent enough), but, if you absolutely need a good Indy sequel, play the old adventure game The Fate of Atlantis.5/10.","

"zeki-4","28 June 2023","I almost gave up all hope. Every action blockbuster nowadays are either defying gravity, mostly shot in front of a green screen or simply lacks an engaging plot. Maybe I'm getting too old. But 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' certainly made me feel young again.No, it is not as great as the first three of course, and yes, there is the occasional use of CGI, but seeing real people doing real stunts in real locations on the silver screen is what made me fall in love with action movies in the first place.What sticks out as a positive surprise is the production design. Case in point: There's an actionscene which takes place during a huge parade in New York. When they shot the scenes every store and facade were made to look like New York in 1969. Posters, merhandise, etc. You hardly see this in the movie, but the meticulous attention to detail is felt throughout the movie.I also really like the themes of this movie. A perfect fit for the swan song of the legend, Indiana Jones.","

"eprusulis","3 July 2023","So I thought the movie was going to be terrible specially, because the last one was OK but one prior was awful and I really didn't think this was gonna be that good of a movie because let's face facts Harrison Ford is getting old. Do you know if so, who wants to watch an 80 year old man running around when it doesn't look real. The actress that played Helena was unbelievable. She helped you move. Keep this moving in the right direction. I also saw Harrison Ford was a lot better than I thought it was gonna be like I mean I don't. I'm sure it was a lot of special effects but I don't even know because maybe he does well for the age , so I thought it was gonna look a little ridiculous with him almost like it the way they did everything it looks realistic but it also you know with him constantly talking about how he feels like he's dying made it also realistic like he was an all the sudden superman . The script of the movie was really good. All the collectors were really it had a really good cast from top to bottom. I wish Mary Ann was in the movie a little bit more instead of the cameo at the end right to be honest, I think she was with Andy instead of helana the movie when I'm done . By reading some of the reviews before I watched it and I should've realize they were going to do this. No, I was expecting my God movie I could barely finish glad I was wrong, and it was a good swan, a good goodbye to Indiana Jones. So may I say maybe a whole Lotta Helena Jones? Well, I don't know her last name, but I could see her doing the next one and the new archaeologists. I didn't have the typical Indiana Jones action and then there's a horse see where he's running through subways with a horse it was great.","

"BA_Harrison","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens as archaeologist Indiana attempts to wrest the fabled Spear of Longinus from the Nazis. When Indy gets his hands on the artefact, it turns out to be a fake, a worthless reproduction -- ironic, because in the prologue, Jones himself is a reproduction, an unconvincing CGI version of the young Harrison Ford, and the film as a whole is a worthless imitation of the far better films that preceded it (yes even Crystal Skull is better).Incredibly, the digitally de-aged Ford isn't the worst thing about this latest instalment in a franchise that should have hung up its fedora for good after the last debacle.Firstly, the cast is awful. This is a Raiders film, so we have to have Ford on board, but he really is way too old now for this kind of movie -- an octogenarian doing the things he does in this film is laughable. We get Toby Jones as Indy's sidekick in the overlong prologue (there's something about him that really grinds my gears) and Mads Mikkelsen as the villain (what inspired casting -- NOT!), but worst of all are Phoebe Waller-Bridge as horsey heroine Helena, and HER sidekick, a mono-browed teenage pickpocket named Teddy (Ethann Isidore). Thought that Willy and Short Round were kinda irritating? This pair take insufferable to a whole new level.Then there's the not inconsiderable absence of Spielberg behind the camera: he might have messed up with the last Indy film, but with the original trilogy under his belt, it's easy to be a little forgiving of one dud. James Mangold, on the other hand, deserves no such goodwill: he's taken a much loved character and put him in some of the most uninspired action scenes imaginable: say what you want about the 'nuking the fridge' scene, or Mutt swinging with the apes, but at least those were memorable. Dial of Destiny is one forgettable set-piece after another, directed with zero flair (the sloppy editing not helping matters).Now let's consider the script. Indiana Jones does time travel. It's every bit as stupid as Indiana Jones meeting aliens, but somehow it also manages to be incredibly dull and tedious, with none of the sense of wonder and magic that one expects from the franchise. I only watched the film an hour ago and already I'm struggling to recall certain scenes, it's all so unremarkable. There's plenty of predictable fan service, but that only serves to remind the viewer of how much better the original films were. To make matters worse, the whole mess is dragged out to an excruciating two hours and thirty-four minutes.In short, we can add Indiana Jones to the ever growing list of once great franchises that Disney has purchased and then stomped all over. 3/10 -- I wasn't expecting it to be great, but this was worse than I imagined.","

"JohnJohnRomualdez","11 August 2023","It's a pity that a few intelligent people ruined the last Indi movie so much. Is no one really paying attention? George Lucas, where have you been? Don't you have anything to say anymore? Obviously not.Spoiler allert:
Worst of all is the Helena character. The woman is just batshit crazy. Has no manners. Treats her Godfather (Indiana) like the last idiot. Then: nobody believes that the woman travels to N. Y. and steals half the disc only to sell it again in Morocco (?) For gambing debts??? What was that about? From then on, the woman is a nightmare in every scene she is in. Her character is just a horrible woman. Zero humor. In every other the movie all the other women were top of their game. Not here.Then this totally superfluous Teddy. Horrible the child, which is simply supposed to be a copy of short round. Why did he actually steal from another young person at the market? Why was there this scene? Completely stupid are the 100 km / h fast TukTuks? Stupid. Why Antonio Banderas played the captain in the first place? He probably just wanted to be there. Anyway.The movie is just boring and again - what were the stupid writers thinking to make Indian Jones look so weak? Harrison, okay at your age and for that much money, then you can do something like that. Nobody wants to see Indiana like in this movie. Maybe someone will just fire Kathleen Kennedy, she is the main person responsible for this stupid, stupid movie.Serves Disney right for losing hundreds of millions of dollars.Worst writing ever!!!!!!!!!","

"TomTalksFilms","28 June 2023","It's been 15 years since the last entry in this much loved franchise (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) was released and after the (putting it very kindly) mixed reception that film received you may have thought that would be the last time we would see Harrison Ford put on the fedora. You'd be wrong though as once Disney get their hands on a property they love to squeeze every penny out of it until it's run right into the ground. I'm sure Disney execs would argue you that this film gives the franchise another chance to end on a high, so the question is does it?Honestly?Not exactlyThe main plot of this film is centred around unsurprisingly The Dial of Destiny or it's proper name as it's referred to in the film the Antikythera (copied it from Google because I can't spell that). The Dial is an artefact that was created by Archimedes and is said to possess the power to let its owner travel through fissures in time (I had one of those on my a** once, it was painful 😬). This results in The Dial being sort after by three main people, Indy himself, A Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) and a student called Helena (Phoebe Waller- Bridge) who all have different intentions for what to do with it. From there the usual Indiana Jones action adventure ensues and firstly I have to say, it's at least better than the Crystal Skull which depending on who you talk to might mean very little.Firstly the positives, the main thing I felt this film did well being that it's confirmed to be the final Indiana Jones film is that it wraps up a lot of the loose ends, in particular it answered a lot of the questions I had after watching The Crystal Skull, so in a list of things you want in a concluding film of a franchise it gets a big tick in that box. Also, seeing Harrison Ford on the big screen is always an absolute joy, he's such an icon and just like all his roles he gives 100% percent in this one.I also felt John Williams score really stood out in this one, another cinema icon and you can't help but smile when a John Williams score plays and it brings back the memories of watching all those classic films for the first time. I also felt that overall as a film in itself it was an enjoyable big screen experience, certainly better than a large number of the films that have come out this year so far.Now for the not so great, most notably that while it's an enjoyable film on its own, other than the score it fails to capture the magic of the original trilogy. It's ultimately just not that memorable and I think that largely comes down to how great the original trilogy is and how great Steven Spielberg is a director, it's really difficult to replicate that kind of cinema magic again with a new director hence why I think the franchise should have stayed as a trilogy.I also felt the trailer which is everywhere and hard to avoid shows you too much of the film, there are even some cameos in the trailer which I would rather have been left as a nice surprise for when I saw the film. In fact most of the first half of the film is in the trailer, it's only really the last 30 mins that comes as any sort of surprise.This film ultimately isn't a bad film in itself but it fails to capture the magic of the original Indiana Jones trilogy and I don't think it's one I'll find myself revisiting all that often.","

"normanemailer","18 September 2023","Having seen all the Indiana Jones movies, I was surprised that the studios decided on one more outing. Even more so that Harrison Ford would accept playing the rôle once more. CGI is there to de-age him for the first part of the film and then we see what an 81 year old body looks like on a semi-naked man who's prepared himself with diet and exercise.What Waller Bridge contributed to the writing and acting was unwanted. She has no charisma on the big screen and being signed by a desperate Hollywood to help write a script that was weak and had plot holes from the opening.This was flat, lacked tension, a lot of tell instead of show. Should never have been made.","

"onepict","16 December 2023","Mads Mikkelsen is simply outstanding in this film and frankly saves it from being a rather boring movie. He is electric and every moment he is on the screen he adds drama and power and momentum to the movie. Unfortunately, we have to endure the toxic and highly unpleasant Phoebe Waller-Bridge who gives strong women a bad name simply by being the female equivalent of the annoying Shia LeBeouf. I have no idea why the powers that be thought it was a good idea to hire someone so lacking in personality and audience appeal and one can only hope she has a bright career in script writing ahead. I found myself fast forwarding through her scenes just to avoid enduring her awful acting, mannerisms and obnoxious personality Overall, perhaps I should have rated this a 7 as I did get to the end of the movie. And kudos to Harrison Ford, of course I enjoyed all his scenes and the quintessential Indy bravado. Between Mads Mikkelsen and Harrison Ford (and a far too short appearance by Antonio Banderas) this is a movie worth watching. But please can writers/directors take heed and cast likeable characters - unlike the highly unpleasant and tiresome Waller-Bridge who I am confident has huge appeal for upper class Englishmen and women. But there's a whole world out there that really doesn't like obnoxious Margaret Thatchers types.","

We went to see it today and honestly, I liked it.. quite a lot! This isn't a story about replacing Indiana Jones with a female character. This is a really good final film and a worthy send off for our beloved adventurer. Don't expect it to be as good as the original three films. Go in with an open mind and realistic expectations, and you'll walk out entertain and humming a famous tune. In the end that's what Indiana Jones movies are all about.","

"gavinp9","2 July 2023","'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' (or Indiana Jones 5) comes 42 years after the original, and while not in the same league as 'Raiders' or 'Last Crusade', it is up there with 'Temple of Doom'. This film is directed by Mangold ('Logan' and 'Ford v Ferrari'), who knows how to film a car/train chase. This time, it's 1969 and we have an older Indy (Ford) trying to find the eponymous ""dial"" (more like an ancient ballerina box) with his goddaughter, Helena (Waller-Bridge).She brings some good humour and a nice presence to balance Indy, as well as another pre-teen offsider, Teddy (Ididore), while Voller (Mikkelsen) and Klaber (Holbrook) are good as the modern-day Nazi bad guys. There's a few slow moments early on (aside from the opening train scene), but the film really hits it's stride in the 2nd & 3rd acts.As with most Indiana Jones films, you have to suspend a bit of disbelief, but the plot-point for the final act is pretty dumb. There's a few cameos, the iconic score from John Williams, some good wise-cracks and a mostly-satisfying ending. Mostly though, it feels comfortable and a mostly-exciting adventure film, as it should be.","

Just what I wanted to see.This movie is almost vindictive in tone, trying to bury the past for a future of Phoebe Waller Bridge--one of the most unlikeable characters ever to hit the screen.Indeed, the only thing that passes for a character arc is that she's not as big an ass at the end as she is in the beginning.How on earth could anyone enjoy this who saw the first three?

"zkonedog","2 July 2023","Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, & Harrison Ford created an iconic Indiana Jones trilogy with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, & Last Crusade. The idea was resurrected in 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull--but sadly in an extremely unfulfilling way. Hence it taking 15 more years to give Indy, hat, and whip a better send-off--which Dial of Destiny most certainly is.For a very basic overview, Dial of Destiny tells the story of Indy (Ford) in the late-1960s. Now a retiring professor, Dr. Jones is goaded into one further adventure--this time with family friend Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)--to find an antique dial that purports to alter the flow of time. As per the usual, the Nazis--this time embodied by former goose-stepper Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen)--harbor similar intentions.Even though it might not be obvious all the time, Dial of Destiny actually gives Indy fans everything they might want out of a legacy finale. For example...-Digital de-aging of Ford gives viewers who missed the original trilogy's theatrical run a taste of what that must have been like.-Old friends Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) & Marion (Karen Allen) return in poignant roles.-There is action/adventure aplenty, as director James Mangold fills this flick to the brim with set pieces and chases of every kind.-All strains of John Williams' iconic score are present and accounted for.Add all this together and Dial of Destiny is a highly entertaining send-off for such an iconic celluloid hero.Now, is Dial of Destiny a perfect, all-time classic? Personally, I have it below Raiders and Last Crusade, but about on par with Temple of Doom (and light years ahead of Crystal Skull!). This one is heavy on the chase sequences (to the possible detriment of some character development) and the final 10-15 might be challenging to some. Not bad, per se, but just far different than anything expected.Overall, though, I had a fun time watching all two hours and 34 minutes of this Indy character finale. I'm a bit befuddled by the critical panning, as Dial of Destiny is certainly better than ""just okay"". In fact, I have a feeling that subsequent viewing might bump this film even higher. I certainly feel a lot better about the legacy of Indiana Jones (and all involved) than I did back in 2008.","

"spencermcook","30 June 2023","Director James Mangold has built an incredible reputation of his film quality with projects such as ""Logan"" ""Ford v. Ferrari"" and ""Walk the Line"" and even though this 5th Indiana Jones installment provides the ingredients to make fans of the franchise feel nostalgic, it doesn't live up to the standard that Mangold has worked so hard to develop. Harrison Ford shares his vintage stubbornness in a character that is seasoned physically yet equally charming, and complimented heavily by a dominant performance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The opening act teases the amount of green screen chase sequences that take place throughout various scenes, and that lack of plausibility slowly dulls what the film intends to provide as the most exciting, and attention-drawing moments of this experience. Dare I say hearing the score from John Williams was the most impressive element that stuck with me afterward, because it's the one piece that never alters from the puzzle. This is a fun family experience (though a bit more edgy) and a safe watch, however I can't help but question whether or not this deteriorates the classic nature of the franchise by reintroducing the lead character in a state completely opposite of what fans grew attached to.","

It is overly reliant on CGI and expects nostalgia to see it through.James Mangold is a competent director but he's no Spielberg. It's almost like he's read a guide to making an Indiana Jones movie and missed the mark. There is no heart to the movie which is the Spielberg spark it's missing.The CGI is horrific with the worst saved for Harrison Ford's face. The movie is like 90% CGI and may as well have been like animation at times. Past characters are written out in abhorrent fashion and threw away without a care.The last 30 minutes.

"Special-K88","7 September 2023","For likely no reason other than a quick cash grab, famed archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is on screen yet again to do what he usually does: track down a MacGuffin, in this instance being the Archimedes Dial, an invaluable artifact possessing Antikythera properties. In 1969, crotchety old Indy is beset with varying personal problems, but still attempting to educate a younger generation of students until he's needed for the latest search. Oh yeah, they threw in a goddaughter for Indy, presumably to raise the stakes. A bit of nostalgia early on, but really brings nothing to the table afterwards...Mangold has a proven track record as a director, but it's unclear what he's trying to accomplish here; there isn't an exceptional story, there's little to no excitement, there's not even a truly adventurous feel which was such a key component in all of the original films. Even at his advanced age an elder, quippy Ford is still quite engaging to watch, and there are some new characters, too bad they aren't interesting and exist only to service a manufactured plot. There's action, banter, globetrotting, nice scenery, some callbacks, and other stuff, but in terms of pure entertainment where's the true value in any of it? How's this for an idea: instead of dragging down established and iconic cinematic characters in a cynical attempt to try and score big bucks with contemporary audiences who weren't even alive when they originated, just make a new movie altogether. **","

"Mischief810","3 July 2023","Worth the ticket price, but still not up to Indiana Jones standards. Granted, this is a very high bar but this film doesn't seem to make much of an attempt to reach it.I frankly believe that Phoebe Waller-Bridge was the wrong actress for this part. Ms. Waller-Bridge simply cannot abandon the sarcastic, quirky characters she has played since forever. She's not dreadful here, but neither does she click like Karen Allen in Raiders or Kate Capshaw in Temple. I also believe that the development of the relationship between Helena and Indy is better suited as part of a post-Indy straight-to-streaming drama flick. It's just out of place here.Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as a bad guy. The fact that his performance exceeds that of the leading man and leading lady is telling.I cannot be the only film lover who has noticed that the Disney Co. Has done little to improve the quality of Lucas content. It feels like the franchises born in the 1970's and 80's are now just being milked for revenues while the corporate office insures that it scores political popularity points. The quality of the art suffers when the art is no longer created for the art's sake.I do still think the movie is worth the ticket price but it really could have been so much better.","

The action was good, the villian was good.The intro scene was pretty atmospheric.%
The deaged Indy looked best in the first shot we see him in, its the shot from the trailer but a little better, maybe because of the better bitrate. Later it looked not as good, some shots were ok, some looked like a low resolution ps4 game. I guess the first shot is the most important one to sell the effect tho. Maybe it looks better If you see it in non imax. Its cool that this kind of technology exits but it is not perfected yet. In Crystal skull, they hid the face when it was a too complicated shot to digitally reface the stunt double. Here they that too but in some shots they used cgi and it didnt really blend well all the time.The soundtrack was ok but like in SW Ep 9 there wasnt really any memorable parts. You recognized some reused tunes here and there from other John Williams scores.Maybe Im slow, but why didnt they go back to the river where they dropped the artifact in the beginning?-
I feel like Indy was underutilized in this movie, in favor for his god daughter. He didnt really do much except for maybe a bit in the opening prologue that made me go ""Indy frack yeah"" while the theme plays. Atleast Crystal skull had that.There was a line that the villian says when talking to Indy, among the lines of ""people dont care about men like us anymore"". Was this some kind of meta thing? This sums up the problem I had with this movie:
I watch Indy because I care. I want to see Indy be the rock star, he is a bit older now which they acknowledged, so maybe he cant physically do everything anymore, but he is older and should be more experienced. I watched it because I wanted to see Indy as the hero, not his god daughter.It wasnt wrong seeing Indy as the grumpy old grandpa but at the end I felt like he should have been utilized more as the hero.","

"amca1960","9 July 2023","I didn't hate this film, but I enjoyed it far less than I expected to. (I enjoyed it more than my partner though, who fell asleep during it.) But it was still far less than it could have been.On the plus side: Harrison Ford is still amazing, and can easily carry off an action adventure. There are the usual splendid scenes of Indy fighting on all sorts of moving vehicles. The baddies - Nazis - are easy to dislike. Ethann Isidore as Teddy was simply wonderful - I wish more could have been made of him.That being said, there didn't seem to be anything really new and exciting about this film. Almost all the action scenes we seem to have seen before: cars and motorbikes with sidecars; trains; it's all been done before. A nice touch though was a wild ride through Tangiers on auto-rickshaws - who knew that these little cheap vehicles were in fact turbo-charged and built (to judge from the battering they received) like tanks?The supporting characters were weak. Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw was a poor foil; you couldn't work out if she had any depth at all; she kept saying (even if it wasn't true) that it was ""all about the money"". She simply wasn't a sympathetic character. Mads Mikkelsen as the Nazi Jürgen Voller again played his cards very close to his chest (as it were), delivering most of his lines in a sort of guarded mutter that was at times hard to understand. At no time did he exude any sort of air of malice. It was as though he simply had a job to do; he made for a boring villain.And the humour - always a nice touch in the best Indiana Jones films, was here in very short supply.One of the delights of Indiana Jones films is the inventive ways in which the villains meet their end: recall the melting scene towards the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark; the way that Donovan ages to dust in The Last Crusade. In this film, though, Voller simply dies in a plane crash (albeit in Ancient Greece) - a very prosaic end.And of course - like so many current films - it was too long for its content. Half an hour shaved off and a tighter direction may have made for a better and more disciplined film.My partner, who's Tamil, said that it was a masala (mixture) of a film, and totally lacking in Bollywood singing and dancing. Come to think of it, he's quite right.I'm sorry to see the Indiana Jones films end with this one. It could have been so much better.","

"justahunch-70549","30 December 2023","The world could certainly have lived without this 5th sequel to a great movie, but it's far, far better than the last one and it has quite a few merits that I really wasn't expecting. Plot wise it's just more of the same hunting and fighting for antiquities with the Nazis with a tomboy female sidekick to assist along with a small kid. That sidekick is this film's secret weapon. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is just made for this and she is a delight throughout. I was initially very turned off by the idea of de-aging Harrison Ford, but it is very well done and while it occasionally briefly looks unreal, for the most part it works well. I don't approve of the process, but that's for another discussion. It kind of makes me sad that that person doesn't exist anymore, but the whole movie is about nostalgia and action which is just about nonstop from beginning to end. I haven't any idea why Antonio Banderas is here in a teeny tiny role of no significance. Has the feel of parts being left on the cutting room floor. What can I say?! I expected to dislike it and I found it quite enjoyable and I assume, as well as hope, that this is the finale!","

"Yanksmoviecritic","19 June 2023","This movie feels like an Indiana jones movie, that's the best way to put it. Indiana jones here is in his late 70s so he can't do the stuff he used too. It's definitely more character driven and even a little glim and darker at times but I enjoyed that. There are still very cool action and set pieces that bring back nostalgia from the first 3. The opening sequence is awesome and I can't wait to rewatch it. Just pure classic indy. Helena's character here isn't bad, it's kinda like Marion from raiders in a way. This movie may not be on the level or raiders or crusade but I think it's still a very very enjoyable adventure.","

"imtiazgafoor","6 December 2023","The much-anticipated latest installment in the Indiana Jones franchise left me with mixed feelings, leaning towards disappointment. As a long-time fan of the adventurous archaeologist, portrayed by the venerable Harrison Ford, I couldn't help but sense a certain staleness in the narrative and execution of the film. The playful charisma of the action is mismanaged, the discoveries of ah-ha moments are redirected to the lackluster costar, and scraps for Indy.The film attempts to recapture the magic of its predecessors, blending action, archaeology, and a hint of the supernatural. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as the iconic Indiana Jones, brings his signature charisma to the screen. His portrayal is still compelling, capturing the essence of the character that has become synonymous with daring adventures and narrow escapes.However, despite Ford's commendable performance, the plot feels like a hodgepodge of recycled elements from previous films.The introduction of new characters is an attempt to inject freshness into the story, but it falls short of making a significant impact. These characters lack the depth and complexity that made the original supporting cast memorable. The chemistry between Indy and his new companions feels forced, unbelievable, their motivations are thinly developed, making it challenging to invest emotionally in the new characters. Basically, over emphasized and exaggerated people we'd expect to be cast aside by any true to the character intelligent indy.One of the glaring issues with the film is its pacing. The action sequences, which were once a highlight of the franchise, now border on cliché. The film seems to rely too heavily on nostalgia, recreating iconic moments from earlier movies without adding any meaningful twists or enhancements. The result is a sense of déjà vu that diminishes the excitement and leaves the audience craving something truly innovative.Furthermore, the film struggles to find a balance between paying homage to the original trilogy and forging a new path. The nods to past adventures often come across as forced and disrupt the flow of the narrative. It feels as though the filmmakers were more focused on recreating the magic of the past than creating a compelling story for the present.Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While the cinematography captures the exotic locales and intense action sequences, the use of CGI at times feels jarring and out of place. The practical effects that were a hallmark of the earlier films are overshadowed by modern technology, robbing the movie of the tangible and gritty feel that defined the Indiana Jones aesthetic.In terms of the storyline, the mystical artifact at the center of the plot lacks the intrigue and mystique of previous MacGuffins. The quest for this object feels more like a checklist of Indiana Jones tropes than a genuine exploration into the unknown. The lack of a compelling antagonist further weakens the narrative, as the stakes never feel as high as they did in the earlier films.In conclusion, while it's always a challenge to meet the expectations set by classic franchises, the latest Indiana Jones installment falls short of the mark. Despite Harrison Ford's valiant effort to bring his iconic character to life once again, the film suffers from a lackluster plot, underdeveloped characters, and an overreliance on past successes. Die-hard fans may find moments of nostalgia, but overall, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the original trilogy timeless.","

"RussHog","1 July 2023","Indiana Jones 5 sucked. It's not as offensive as the fourth one, but in a way...it's worse. Like how Disney Star Wars sequels are worse than the shockingly incoherent prequels. The opening scene is kinda cool and is the only part of the movie that feels like a classic Indiana Jones film. It might be worth it just to see the opening scene but that is about it.The biggest problem with the film is the co-star is so annoying and Indiana Jones becomes a second fiddle sidekick in his own movie - and he loses all of the spark that made him such an incredible hero in the first three films. This really should have had Shorty from Temple of Doom and it might have sucked less.Really, between aliens and time travel - I don't know how much more you can mess up a franchise that so beautifully made the ancient cultures of the world so mysterious and powerful - and they were truly the stars of the film.I'm glad Indy got one final film that isn't Crystal Skull, I'm just sorry that it had to be The Dial of Destiny.","

The only Indiana Jones film not by Steven Spielberg that was very well directed by James Mangold. I love a couple films by James especially Identity and Logan so that made me even more intrigued on top of how I reviewed the other Indiana films in the last few weeks, crazy how the first one came out 42 years and 2 weeks ago. This is a great entry from start to finish, Harrison Ford is magnificent throughout and so is the exhilarating action. I'm quite impressed how John Williams is around 92 and still does the music. I highly recommend this gem to anyone!","

"mkivtt","3 July 2023","This movie was terrible. Is starts out well enough with maybe 15 minutes of action with a de-aged Indiana Jones fighting the nazis at the end of world war two.Then it all falls apart. Fast forward 25 years and Indy is a bitter old divorced loser who has nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to. But wait, here comes his goddaughter (from a supposed best friend we never knew about until now)! She's smart, much smarter than this pathetic old man. She's snotty. She's arrogant. She's beyond annoying. Kathleen Kennedy, is that you???So yeah, for the rest of the movie Indy serves as the pale reflection to make this annoying woman look good. He's stupid and slow, she's fast and smart and strong.To add insult to injury, they bring back Sallah from the previous movies (Gimli from Lord of the Rings) for a few minutes. He wants to adventure with Indy, and asks if he can join him. Wouldn't that be great? That's what fans want to see! But nope, the writers can't let that happen of course. It would take away from their annoying stupid new main character, the snotty girl! So Indy tells Sallah to get lost, and that's the last we see of him. Pathetic.If Disney thinks this kind of drivel is what fans want to see, they're mistaken. Nobody wants their childhood idols toppled and made into pathetic old fools, who were never even good to begin with apparently, says Disney. Nobody wants to see your annoying virtue-signaling messaging, your Mary Sue replacement characters, your bad CGI, and your obvious seething hatred at having to make a movie in a franchise that you either despise or don't understand, or both.May Disney lose hundreds of millions on this piece of fan disrespect.","

"Eric266","12 December 2023","It took me four separate viewings to get through this movie. It did get better, but its not a great movie by any means.The first 20 minutes are about as good as any other parts of the series. But then the next hour is grating. The dialogue is amateurish and the action scenes are so contrived its like they had several set pieces in mind and just needed to fill in gaps to get from one to the other. Lots has been written about the Helena character played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She annoyed me very much in the early parts of the film, which is why I kept turning it off. The last 45 minutes or so, her character tones down the annoyance factor and she's a decent addition. Had she played the character that way from the beginning, I think a lot of the hate would have been diffused. It wasn't a character arc. There was no situation that made her stop being annoying. She just stopped being annoying. Its like they wrote scenes for two separate characters, one who would be killed off, then changed their minds and combined the scenes/dialogue into one Helena character.During the iconic scenes of the red line crossing the map as they traveled the world, someone decided NOT to include the theme song. I mean, WTF!?Indiana Jones deserved a better send off than this. It wasn't terrible, maybe a bit too long and the direction was weak, but it still can't match the previous entries. It was missing the element of fun and adventure from previous entries and that is what really turned me off. It just didn't match the escapist tone of the earlier movies.","

( Only for those who missed watching it during its theatrical release in June 2023)Set in 1969, the film follows Indy Harrison Ford) and his estranged goddaughter, Helena ( Phoebe waller- Bridge) , who are trying to locate a powerful artifact before Jürgen Voller ( Mads Mikkelsen) an ex-Nazi scientist, uses it to alter the outcome of World War II by traveling back in time.

But the adrenaline rush moments that made us a fan of the franchise in the first place are sorely missed. The plot is insipid and the climax could have been more tense and gripping!!However the first 25 mins with a younger de-aged Indy ( with AI and other special effects) in an action scene set in 1944 is probably the best part of the film !!For die-hard fans of the the Indiana Jones franchise, a decent one time watch and a time to say goodbye to Harrison Ford who has been essaying this role since the 80's!!Going with 2.5 stars out 5 with a 0.5 star for Harrison Ford who gives it his all ....

Other than that, it's just mindless action with no story at all. It was a mistake to have an Indiana Jones movie not directed by Steven Spielberg. Even John Williams' heart was clearly not in this. For a while, I was wondering if he even did the music. Just disappointing on many levels. The whole beginning of the movie was unnecessary to the story. It could have just as easily been something mentioned in a conversation between two characters. And all of the artifacts that Indy ever dealt with, the Dial is the most pointless.","

"silicontourist","27 October 2023","It just lacked that Stephen Spielberg fantasy magic dust that made all the previous Indiana films so magical. I did however still enjoy watching it (though I agree with one of the reviewers that it was overly long for what it offered up).It lacked good jokes and humour and the script was a little scrappy and unsure, in that you never get to know any in depth background on the Dial of Destiny itself. Explanations, in films of the last few years, have been very lacking and downright diabolical stupidity of the scriptwriters; and the directors. Ford does his best and holds the film together but other than the films opening 10 minutes or so, it lacks the usual slow build up of dastardly craziness, funny people, actions and events that we have become used to in the previous outing.As a huge fan of Indiana Jones I still enjoyed it well enough that I could watch it again but, to newer viewers It may be found to be wanting in large parts of the story.","

Remember when movies could just be fun without every part if it being ripped apart by couch critics??? That most likely have 0 creativity themselves. I really get disgusted by the fact that people can't just enjoy films for what they are. Entertainment. I thought this edition of Indiana Jones was exactly what I hoped for. Fun. Adventure. Nostalgia. Treasure. Borderline mystical. Great job to everyone involved making it. Now I hope they find a way to bring back a version of Indiana for future adventures. I don't care about people that complain about leaving alone what has been already done. I want more adventures. Much like James Bond, we can have more adventures even if it's not the same exact actor. Or create a new character to take up where Indy left off. Just lets have more adventures to remember.Just one real fan's opinion.","

The opening sequence is sensational, with the CGI at probably 90% realistic vs 70% in Rogue One. It is still, unfortunately, very distracting. Fleabag fans will allow PWB plenty of goodwill, but she is borderline annoying at times. Disney are almost certainly eyeing a franchise for her, no matter what they say.

"vishwatej286","1 July 2023","Indiana Jones Character is one of the Iconic Character ever made in the History. Harrison Ford played the character for over 4 Decade. And he still has fantastic screen presence at his 80's age. This is the 1st time James Mangold has directed an Indiana Jones movie. Previous Indiana Jones were made Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Although James has directed for the first time, He still did a great job in Direction.This movie can't be compared with with 'Raiders' and the 'Last Crusade'. As per my point of view, Those two movies were masterpiece. But still 'Dial of Destiny' stands as its own because the story take place in Later age of Prof. Indiana Jones with changes in culture and Technology and his age. This is the first Indiana Jones movie which is longer in story line, locations where the story takes place and more action than any previous Indiana Jones movie ever made. This is the last movie that John Williams ever composed music.There are Few drawbacks;
(1) You will miss Spielberg direction Style and Action sequence.(2) In the Climax sequence the story gets little carried away.(3) Few actors makes Cameo but very less impact in the story.Phoebe Waller Bridge is the new entry as character in Indiana Jones movie. And she really pulls off the character. Mads Mikkelsen as always f*ing great. He can act any character without agitation.Overall ""Dial of Destiny"" is a very well made action Adventure movie as per Indiana Jones franchise.It Deserves 8/10.","

"loufalce","30 June 2023","I'll save you the time. Disney defiles everything they touch, and this is the prime example. This junk movie is exactly the mess you were expecting. The critics have spoken, and they re right. You can almost feel sorry for this mess if it were not for Phoebe Waller Bridge, possibly one of the most annoying actresses today. She tries to upstage Ford with practically ever line she utters, and she is just plain obnoxious in a very patronizing way like your left wing, trust fund cousin (fill in her name) that you can't stand. 80 year old Ford himself doesn't fare much better a a broken, boozy Indiana in his twilight years. His CGI 'de ageing' scenes early in the film have a very disturbing creepiness about them. This film was in development hell for three years and it shows. I also heard there were several reshoots too. Story has something to do with an ancient device that may offer some clues for time travel. The Nazis get hold of it and after the war, they are recruited by the US space program. All the action is predictable, the set pieces are rendered in terrible CGI, there is a horseride through a NY subway, and a rather uninspired minicab chase that seems to mirror the truck race in 'Raiders'. And to make matters worse, most of the film has a dark , gloomy color (pallor?) to it. It all looks very cheap even if it cost 300 million dollar to make. And at 2 and a half hours, its about 45 minutes longer than it should be. There is no sense of fun, joy, or excitement that made he first three installment the only ones worth watching And if Sallah can't make you smile,you know it will be a ride not worth taking. A cash grab and very undignified funeral, eulogy and burial of fine series. Speilberg, Mangold, and Lucas,shame on you! This one was so bad, it made me change my 2008 1 star rating of 'The Crystal Skull'
to 4 stars. Another 'number two' P. U. movie review from Lou.","

"providerssok","4 July 2023","The latest installment in the Indiana Jones series fails to capture the essence and thrill that characterized its predecessors. This film disappoints with its lackluster execution, missing the mark on delivering an engaging adventure filled with gripping action and captivating storytelling.One of the primary shortcomings lies in the convoluted plotline. The narrative feels forced and lacks the simplicity and cohesiveness that made previous films so enjoyable. The inclusion of certain elements and artifacts seems out of place within the established Indiana Jones universe, detracting from the historically grounded nature that fans have come to love.Furthermore, the characterization of the iconic Indiana Jones himself falls short. The once-charismatic and witty archaeologist, brought to life by a talented actor, is overshadowed by an uninspired script. The beloved charm and charisma that defined the character are sorely missed, leaving fans disconnected from the protagonist they have grown to adore.The film's pacing is also a letdown, with unnecessarily prolonged action sequences that fail to capture the same level of excitement as the iconic set pieces of earlier movies. The overreliance on CGI effects and green screen technology further detracts from the authenticity and immersion that fans have come to expect from an Indiana Jones film.Additionally, the introduction of new supporting characters feels forced and unconvincing. Their inclusion does little to enhance the story or establish meaningful relationships, lacking the chemistry and depth found in previous films.Overall, this latest Indiana Jones adventure falls short of the high standards set by its predecessors. Its convoluted plot, underdeveloped characterization, and excessive reliance on CGI make it a disappointing addition to the franchise. Fans may find brief moments of nostalgia, but ultimately, this film fails to live up to the legacy of the adventuring archaeologist, leaving viewers yearning for the excitement and magic of the earlier films.","

No, but then again. No one was expecting it too.Did it surpass Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?Absolutely.Dial of Destiny"" faces the daunting task of living up to the legendary Indiana Jones trilogy, widely regarded as one of the greatest film series of all time.In its attempt to pay homage to its predecessors, the movie cleverly incorporates familiar elements like the ever-present Nazis, allowing Indy ample opportunity to unleash his trademark punches, and spine-chilling encounters with creepy-crawlies.While this nostalgic approach runs the risk of paling in comparison to the earlier films, director Mangold rises to the occasion, skillfully steering the action sequences with a refreshing and dynamic touch. His deep understanding of Indy's character is evident through the compelling character arc portrayed on screen, as well as a sprinkle of nihilism not dissimilar from what he did with Logan's character arch.Not to be overshadowed, John Williams' timeless score sweeps through the film with an air of grandeur, resonating with audiences from the first iconic notes. The music effortlessly transports viewers into the adventurous world of Indiana Jones, sending chills down their spines and setting the stage for a captivating journey.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny serves as a bittersweet but delightful swansong for Harrison Ford's iconic hero. While not without its flaws, the film embraces its imperfections and delivers an enjoyable experience that fans will appreciate. It often feels like a lovingly crafted ""greatest hits"" compilation, featuring familiar setpieces and relationships with a fresh twist. And you know what? That's perfectly fine.","

"rannynm","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is another classic adventure with Harrison Ford's intrepid archeologist, but the movie shifts into a better gear when it reinvents rather than repeats. That said, nothing beats seeing this character back in the saddle, riding off into the sunset in search of the next great artifact.The movie opens in 1969 -- we've landed on the moon, but Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has landed a job as a professor at a sleepy university in New York. The adventure begins when his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) offers him a chance to find a dial from ancient times that is rumored to have extraordinary capabilities. Indy soon discovers he's not the only one in search of the dial. A foe from Indy's past is on the trail with a posse of armed, dangerous associates and he wants to use the dial to rewind time and undo the events of World War II in the Nazi's favor. Indy and Helena's quest for a relic becomes a globe-trotting mission to stop the dial from being used for evil.It's a winning celebration of all things Indiana Jones, the character, Harrison Ford's performance, the movies, and a reminder of why we love them. When the movie turns its focus away from honoring the past and instead tells a whole new Indy adventure, that's where it gets really good. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starts with a thud. We see a flashback featuring a digitally de-aged Harrison Ford as a younger Indy in his first brush with the titular Dial, aided by an anxious professor (Toby Jones). It sets up the fabric of the story ahead, but the de-aging effect doesn't work like it needs to. It immediately creates a distance between us and the adventurer we're here to see. It's disquieting to see Indiana Jones not as we've known him for five movies now, but as a manipulated, augmented version of himself. A large portion of the rest of the movie suffers from the same flaws -- in honoring the franchise's past it feels like it keeps doing things we've seen before. In the final stretch, though, it does something I've never seen these movies do before, more specifically, somewhere Indy has never ventured.There isn't a lesson per se to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny but all stories that deal with time and its manipulation remind us that we have to try to be happy where we are, rather than live in the past. If you've seen an Indiana Jones movie, you know that faces can get melted off or hearts pulled out in the pursuit of treasure, be warned that there is frequent violence and some profanity.I give Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny swings into theaters nationwide on June 30, 2023. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!","

I decided it would be nice to see the movie with my wife so I went. I figured worse case would be I have a nice nap in the cool theater on a 105 degree day.The movie did started off with some CGI magic that usually puts me right to sleep, but this was pretty different and for the most part, kept my interest.The movie was built around a bunch of chase scenes that once again, usually put me to sleep, but they were short and to the point for which I was grateful.The story line is what held me and I found it intriguing. Let me put it this way: It was a million times better than the unmentionable piece of dung that was the previous installment.The movie was long, but it was very watchable and I did not take a restroom run even though I had to for the last hour.Harrison Ford's performance was much better than what I expected and the cliches were held to a manageable level.The rest of the cast did a solid job and there was no one who was annoying or took away from the movie in any way.Truth be told, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will see it again.","

"fraser-simons","2 July 2023","This was a lot more fun than I expected, and I pretty much purely expected a romp. The and shots and attention to historical nostalgia and great set design, really all the production is just hit out of the park. Way more jokes than I expected landed, the story is very well paced, knowing what is appealing about the franchise and playing to its strengths.What I didn't expect, was how chefs kiss the ending would be. The third act goes a bit off the rails, otherwise the movie is 4*+, but it really, really nails the ending, along with the treatment of the Nazis and the outcome. It really treats that element well and actually has a little something to say about Indie, which was icing on the top. Everything talked about in the film is used for content, with fun foreshadowing occurring that I doubt anybody would really expect. Just a great time.","

"statuskuo","1 July 2023","At least I got 2+ hours of air conditioning. Indiana Jones starts off trying to get the lance of Longinus and turns out it's the ""dial of destiny"" created by Archimedes to travel through time portals.Uh-HuhFlash forward 30 years and now he's a retiring professor at a university where the student body is full of disinterested hippie losers, who most likely got in to dodge the Vietnam War. Does this ever play into Dr. Henry Jones' life. Nope. Other than to say Mutt died in the war, nothing is ever brought up again. In a movie this long, you would think a little twinge of disgust for these people would be a running gag. Specifically his estranged (?) god-daughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She dresses and acts like him. You would think the powers that be would understand that perhaps she would have a moment where she wanted to be like Indy but turns out she was turned off by the result of globe-trotting for treasure. Instead, we discover she is a mercenary for fortune (and glory). Ugh. This movie stinks beyond words. Long gone is that twinkle in his eyes. He's addressed disrespectfully as ""Indy"" (you call him Dr. Jones, doll!) and now also has to tug around a street urchin Arab kid Teddy. Does this not look like ""Temple Of Doom""They're racing to get this dial before Mads Mikkelson finds it...and wants to...um...kill Hitler? So he can take over and win the war. Again...ugh.Though the stakes are cleared here than ""...Crystal Skull"" the moments are so forced to really lazy effect. It feels like the gas in it deflated maybe 30 years ago. The charm smirk in the first three flicks is gone and we are left with a guy who drinks way too much and does so very little. The heavy lifting is given to Helena who seems to developed fight skills even henchmen would covet. Where would she learn that when her Pop was mousy Toby Jones? Give us a moment where we can believe she is tough. In ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" Marion does seem like a person who can handle a fistfight in her Nepal bar. She seems so painfully neutered when she returns at the end of this flick.The production design is outstanding but made ugly and cheap by awful digital cinematography. The glossiness of hard light played like a serial are exchanged for a more modern look. Discredit that to utilitarian Phaedon Papamichael who previously lensed better projects. It all just feels cheap.Incidentally, director James Mangold's big mouth fighting back against fans on social media does have credibility. His stance was watch the movie and THEN criticize. Well, sir, I paid and watched your garbage flick and you are a terrible filmmaker. Yeah, he owes the fans a massive apology.I await the day when he goes online and blames the think tank of Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Lucas (especially this joyless hack) for this failure he dumped on paying audiences.","

"captbgb","4 December 2023","Dial of Destiny has a great premise and an enjoyable first and third act, but all in all it's brought down by lazy plotting and poor writing in the 2nd act. I'm glad I watched it. It filled a void in the franchise. However, it could and should have been much better. Indy's goddaughter has no redeeming qualities through most of the movie, and she never really arcs in a meaningful way. In the third act, she acts like she finally grows a soul. Unfortunately there's no foreshadowing to make it seem anything but a convenience. She is singlemindedly all about the money for most of the movie, and her actual change of heart comes off as contrived. I found her annoying. The logic used to explain the story beats are quite unfounded and also come across as completely contrived. Worth watching if you're over 70 and couldn't wait to see Raiders when the trailers first appeared on TV. I actually went to a screening with friends who had no idea what they were going to see.","

There were a couple of moments/lines of dialogue I liked but I have no recollection what they were now.The main problem: this is called an Indiana Jones movie, but Indiana Jones does nothing. Nothing.In the first action sequence, he escapes. In the ""old days"" Indiana ran into danger. Now he rides away from it on a horse.For the rest of the movie he's basically being lead around by Helena, who is the main focus here. If you digitally removed Indiana from the movie, it'd basically be the same movie.I completely believe that the ending was changed, and that Helena was meant to be the hero going forward. Just another Kathy Kennedy surrogate. Yawn.","

"The-Sarkologist","28 August 2023","You know, come to think of it, I almost feel as if the third Indiana Jones film sort of gave me the impression that it would be the last - especially with a title like 'The Last Crusade'. Mind you, I guess Ford really did want to give it one last crack, especially since he has pretty much said that he is retiring as an actor. In fact, him retiring as an actor, and Jones retiring as a university professor, does fit the character well, and apparently there had been plans to actually release four sequels.Anyway, the film starts during World War II, where Jones and Basil are attempting to retrieve some artifacts from a train heading to Berlin. They believe that the Nazi's have procured the Spear of Destiny, that is the spear that was used to pierce the side of Christ, but as it turns out that it is a fake. However, another artifact has been uncovered - the Antikythera device, which is apparently a lot more powerful.Actually, I was quite thrilled to discover that this whole movie was focused around the device, which was recovered from a Roman wreck off the coast of the island of Antikythera. Apparently it is said to have been one of the earliest examples of a computing device. Mind you, this is Indiana Jones, so of course this device ends up being more than a simple calculating machine.Look, I did like the film, though I have to admit that the chase scenes sort of start to get pretty boring, especially when there seems to be one after the other, and they drag out for way too long as well. However, one think I did like is that there were hints in the film as to what was coming up, especially with the puppet play that they encounter in Sicily. However, there were some problems, namely with one of the explanations as to how they landed up where they did at the end of the film. Honestly, continental drift has nothing to do with it. The other thing was how did the bad guy's find them in Sicily so quickly - I thought they had been given the wrong co-ordinates.Still, other than that, yeah, it was a fitting end to the Indiana Jones films.","

EUROPEAN FILM AWARD winner Mads MIKKELSEN shines as an ultra-nasty Wernher von Braun blend. Wonderfully old-fashioned adventure film that hops from Morocco to Greece to Sicily!After three weeks in theaters, the film grossed almost $300 million worldwide.

For me this movie had a certain checklist:Fun ✅
Action ✅
Indy being Indy ✅
Mystery ✅
Memorable characters ✅
Humor ✅It's not perfect or the absolutely best film in the series but it's also not the train wreck that it's being made out to be. Best advice is always to just to watch it and judge yourself. Great flick!","

"Truedutch","28 June 2023","I think this is better than the crystal skull, I think the story was way more engaging and a better plot. Nazi's and Indiana Jones are required. It was a movie of up's and downs and I don't mean emotionally, I mean there would be a sequence I like but then straight after it would be an annoying sequence.I don't know about everyone else but I feel Indiana Jones was the worst part about this. The Daughter was also soooo good at everything of course and I also found it hard to hear her? Especially in the ludicrous chase scene in Tangier. I felt like the kid added zero to this film apart from having him there the whole time just to follow them through the time portal to fly them home. The first 45 minutes there were about 50 one punch knockouts with also about 10 captures of Indiana where you're left thinking just maim the guy or kill him. He escapes so many times it blows your mind.Mads was great as the villain but seemed to just have that timing like the French guy from raiders of the lost arc, just always turned up jusssst as Indiana worked something out.I did enjoy the mystery solving I'm a sucker for that and some good action mixed in with some average action I'm fine with. I was glad that at the end they went full speed into the ending and didn't hold back, I was hoping they were actually going back in time and I loved that they did and didn't fake out not go through the portal.If you like Indiana Jones and didn't like Crystal Skull you'll still go see this.","

It's not the years; it's the mileage - personified - with Ford giving his swan song as the titular, globe-trotting archaeologist with this rousing, rip-roaring return to form for the franchise as his retiring professor is reunited with his goddaughter (flinty & feisty Waller-Bridge giving as good as it gets) facing Nazis (them again!) when an ancient artifact is sought after by an old foe of Indy's (Mikkelsen dryly perfectly cast) which may change history as we know it. Set circa 1969 with set pieces and grand chases from WWII Europe to NYC to Sicily to Morocco and clever CGI de-aging for Ford in the opening salvo as well as some touchstones from the past (hello Sallah!) Kinetically directed by James Mangold (who co-scripted with Jez Butterworth, Joh-Henery Butterworth and David Koepp) the film slam bangs with precision and verve. Ford's iconic hero is given a shot of pathos, vulnerability, gravitas and finally, reverence which is all any one could want for in the long run.","

"jeroenv","16 December 2023","No, it is not the best Indiana Jones movie. Yes, it is a bit too long. Yes, Ford is no longer in his thirties. No, the action sequences are not as thrilling as the mine-cart chase from Temple. This is all true, but isn't this to be expected?Raiders and Crusade are close to perfect films, and this installment certainly isn't. But when it's good it's very good, and the lesser parts don't go on too long. It makes for a very fun viewing, if you accept that things are never going to be exactly like in those 2 movies. It has some nostalgia, while acknowledging the age of the main protagonist and that things have changed. The story is far-fetched but grounded in reality just enough for you to suspend disbelief. The action is great to watch. It has heart. It's just...fun, a well-made film with some characters from way back in a new adventure. You know, like Temple and (to a certain extent) Crystal Skull. Or like most James Bond-movies.So if you approach it with that mindset, you're in for a fun ride. If you want a second Raiders, don't bother.","

"lozanoderrick","12 December 2023","This movie was a clear departure from the magic that Lucas/Spielberg cast on all 4 movies, yes, even Kingdom! Since Disney took over LF, for this movie they simply hired writers that are clearly from a different generation than the ones that helmed the previous films. The writers for this movie mocked Indiana Jones, made him weak, and basically a carpet for other characters to walk all over him. Phoebe's character Helena was rude, sarcastic, and a feminist that did nothing but to further show how today's writers do not value characters such as Indy that was a strong leader that truly did things his way. The 21st century Short Round character Teddy Kumar was boring, dry, and another whipping boy for Helena to boss around.What they should have done was hire Lucas and Spielberg to direct/write the movie and even bring back Short Round to help Indy one last time to go on one last fortune and glory filled adventure. Disney as of late has truly been disrespectful to George Lucas and truly twisted the creative world he had with Star Wars and the Indiana Jones franchise. This movie was another sad reminder that today's writers are filled with an agenda to satisfy a small amount of people who will never watch or even talk about this film ever again after having watched it one time.","

Whereas those ones were inspired by classic boys own adventure stories by the likes of Rider Haggard, this seem inspired by The Expendables and other trashy action pictures.This is a reasonably enjoyable film but the endless succession of fights, car chases, fights, fights and more fights just get tedious after a few hours. Ford and PWB are both excellent creating real people you can believe in but the story lacks soul. The relationship between them feels genuine and actually quite touching but there's far too much padding. It feels like they were given $300M and told to just spend it on whatever they could.It's certainly worth watching but it's disappointing.","

She's constantly snatching the thread of a conversation away from Indy, constantly imposing herself in situations, when she's not on screen, we can take a deep breath because we feel so much better. Then it turns back to a Indy film.First film we had Marion, a tough woman who had charisma and not a know it all character. She was Indy's equal.Second film we had Willie, she didn't know how to fight didn't know how to shoot guns. She was out of her element, and she was fun.This film is way too long.

I thought this was the whole point when he said he would go back and save his son. I mean given the chance why the hell wouldn't you save your son? It is probably because Shia Labeouf was his son and he won't do another and regrets doing Crystal skull. They could have cast somebody else maybe, but that's obviously the reason. The thing is disney love to make more films just look at Star Wars. There's money to be made from Indianna Jones. So I thought this would have been passing the torch but it wasn't.Also the lead actress I couldn't stand her. Her demeanour and look was more of a villain than a hero. Plus for 9/10 of the movie she was kind of villain with the way she acted. The bad guy was brilliantly cast.Started off brilliantly, then slowly got worse as the film went on.

"661jda","1 July 2023","Thank you for bringing Indy back-after the last one, I thought you buried him. As long as Harrison Ford is around, you can always bring up an Indiana Jones saga. I'll never say anything bad about Ford's performance as Jones. Honestly believe he should have at least been nominated for RAIDERS. He never fails to please and does so again here. But the story is uneven. Sometimes speeding manically along and then when it slows down--it stops. Bringing in Waller Bridge was a good idea to keep the story lively although I'm not convinced so much of her conversion from thief at the end. Maybe the next will push her back to the dark side and the emergence of a new ""indy junior"" would be a good thing. Mads is a good villian-you will really want to hate him at one point. Unfortunately, Teddy is no Short-Round. He lacks the likeability and thats a hole in this story: he's not charismatic nor is he really likeable so you almost don't care what happens to him other than he is integral to saving Indy and Wombat towards the end. Indiana Jones is a character that really shouldn't die: he is the 1930s version of Luke Skywalker: to make him go away will almost be unAmerican, but we need to get to another hero and the next jones should be the bridge that this one wasn't. Still - I would rather pay money to see this flawed jones than pay money to see half the films that are also coming out this year.","

What is done to him as that aged character is too much. This is one nasty scrape after another. The enemies are the Nazis--well one in particular, who would like to go back in time and kill Hitler (whom he thinks screwed up the war). To do this he needs to get his hands on a magical dial that has time travel capabilities. There is a device that was engaged by Archimedes (remember-the guy in the bathtub in science class). Others can go through the thousand and one things that happen in tis episode. There are so many unexplained thing, solutions without clear problems. It's just a disappointment and did not need to be made.","

Ignoring the plot holes, the story was pretty decent. Action was fine, and Harrison Ford did a good job with his stunts (yes, Harrison Ford did his own stunts). Admittedly the stunts weren't as great compared to the other Indiana Jones' movies, but with his age can you blame him? He did the best and I think the results were fine.The characters were fine too I guess. Wombat was probably my least favorite character, but I assume she's supposed to be unlikable with how her whole character is selfish, which is something Indy acknowledges.If you didn't care for the supernatural aspects in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you probably won't care for this film then. It's really hard to explain without going into spoilers, but the Dial itself does have some sort of supernatural powers that end up being the whole climax of this film. But at the end of the day it matter to me, and it shouldn't matter to you anyways when a movie like Temple of Doom introduced voodoo.I'd say my biggest complaint was how this film played it too safe, but other than that I'm not mad at its existence because it doesn't really change anything for existing. The film's fine, its re-watchable for the action, but maybe not so much it's story. It's entertaining when it has to be, an underwhelming yet decent conclusion, and that's pretty much it.","

"getthedamnbell","4 July 2023","Keeping Indiana Jones alive this long is essentially elder abuse on a cinematic scale. Disney is out to destroy all white male character heroes (Indiana Jones, Star Wars) and Kathy Kennedy and the other Disney/Lucasfilm execs are making it happen. First Star Wars was flushed down the toilet and now what's left of elderly Indiana being shocked back to life and dragged out for one more squeeze at the box office. Absolutely disgusting. If these characters were ladies, feminist academics would be teaching courses on the destruction of modern womanhood in contemporary cinema based solely on what we're seeing here. But they get away with it because the gender script is flipped. Let Indiana Jones rest in peace.","

"erimerdi","4 September 2023","When the Dial of Destiny came out I read lots of negative comments also when a movie comes out I always check the box office openings and when I saw it ended up flopping I thought ok, they finally messed up a good thing too and I refused to go and see it in the movie theatre because I'm an Indiana Jones fan and I love the franchise. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie that I visit time to time and still enjoy watching it. Part of the reason is I didn't want to ruin the love and respect that I got for IJ franchise If the this last IJ movie did actually disrespect the franchise. Of Course, I knew I would watch it when it is on Demand. It has been a while since it came out and finally yesterday I watched it at home and I don't understand what's wrong with those people? They have been bashing the movie so hard even the fans got affected by them and for what?I think the movie is made more believable in many senses. An almost 80 years old Indiana acts like an old man who had his time and adventures in his prime. I don't see any problems in that. I would feel like cheated if Indiana moves and fights like he is in his 40s so at hos 80s he acts like he is an old man who still got spark in him. The movie also got all the classical elements of Indiana jones movies. There are always some supernatural elements blend in with good adventure and action. This is stil the case with the Dial of Destiny. Bottom line is I loved the movie I don't understand why there has been so much hate for this final IJ movie. I enjoyed watching it and I will visit it time to time in the future.","

"trumpsportal","8 July 2023","Disney is becoming more and more synonymous with disaster and desperation. This movie gets a 10 on both these measures. A complete and utter disaster and desperately poor on any measure.The film is a series of geriatric movie ""chase scenes"" with no originality, defined purpose or any reason to merit interest, from the viewer.Harrison Ford is his usual self, only he is now old and tired. It is just another movie where Harrison Ford is once again, Harrison Ford, but, this time, reading lines from a completely unoriginal and banal script.There is no meaningful story line, original or inspiring script to support his complete lack of the remotest semblance of any acting skills.To top it off the leading ""actress"" role is played by an equally talentless British ""comedienne"" who contributes nothing but pure ham to this movie salad.The movie is only successful in so far as, it has completely destroyed the Indiana jones franchise and any hope of a sequel.RIP Indiana Jones.","

"michael-a-meier","31 January 2024","This movie contains - maybe too intentional - all reknown Indiana-Jones elements and consists of car chases magic artifacts, insects, strong women and journeys around the world. The story has no real surprises, this could have been done better.What really bothers me is the portrayal of old men and women in some important Hollywood movies. Why do they have to be disillusioned, kind of messed up elders? This is neither worthy of a figure like Indiana Jones, nor of Luke Skywalker and yet, there it is. For me, the whole settng of Indys Life in the sixties (appartment, university, relations) is kind of depressing. It´s a shame, George Lucas would definatly have done better. Indiana Jones could have gotten some wisdom, or maybe some relaxed charm like his movie father Sean Connery. In ""Shrinking"", you can see Harrison Ford more like that.","

"petercarlsson-92297","2 July 2023","This is not a Indiana Jones movie. This is a ""Indiana Jane"" movie. The whole show is about making the very unlikable Helena-character the star of the movie. She have all the good lines (or at least that was the writers intention).At the same time they have made Indiana Jones an old, depressed man that all through the movie is patronised by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She abuses Indy by hitting him, making fun of his ideas and knowledge, and even trying to kill him. Is that fun watching? Ni it's not, it's depressing and to be honest straight out insulting to the viewer and true Indy fan.So this 300 million mess is also boring. The action scenes are just CGI and is not taken seriously and therefore only becomes distractions of the story. And the story... it's even worse with logical gaps the size of Grand Canyon. But the writers don't care, they make a 12 year old fly a plane, and land it. That's the level of realism we get.So, please save your hard earned money and see the first movie instead. That one still shines while this is one is pure garbage.","

"Venge","29 June 2023","Disney gets hold of the Indiana Jones franchise, and suddenly you have a Karine Jean-Pierre lookalike, globally round afro and all, doing double-duty as a CIA agent. However, apart from that lame attempt at political-correctness, Disney just let general silliness, plot holes, and questionable cast selections round out the rest of the movie. However, for all Disney's best efforts to ruin yet another film icon, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny turned out to be an enjoyable movie.I just saw the film this afternoon, so have had little time to reflect on it, but overall enjoyed myself. The first 20 minutes, with the de-aged Harrison Ford, were a lot of fun ... very much like old times. The middle part of the movie dragged somewhat, but it did all rise to a very nice climax. The post climax final scene was touching in a strange way ... no spoilers here though.The cast of the movie were good to merely OK. Harrison Ford was his usual brilliant self, playing a character he has owned for over 4 decades. However, I did not find Phoebe Waller-Bridge either likeable enough, nor a strong enough actor, to carry off the amount of screen time she was given. Mads Mikkelson played his usual very solid villain, a role he seems to have turned into a very nice career. Need a villain? Get Mads! However, the ""kid"" ... it seems every Indy movie has to have a kid ... played by Ethann Isidore, didn't seem to have a clue how to act in front of a camera. Maybe it was simply the fact that the role of ""the kid"" just seemed to be shoe-horned into the story line for no apparent reason whatsoever. Who was he? Where did he come from? And most of all, why did he have to be there?Overall, though, I'd give the movie the proverbial thumbs up, maybe simply because I'm a die-hard fan of the franchise, and saw the first instalment in the theatre way back in 1981. Maybe I just needed another chance to go see Indy one last time.","

"KayBay87","30 July 2023","This final installment of the Indiana Jones series was somewhat of a letdown. I feel like the opportunity for an excellent story was missed. I understand that Indiana Jones is older in this installment but there was something missing, I can't put my finger on it. Was it the writers aim for us to feel a little sorry for Indy? I wonder. In addition, this film didn't have the wit we have grown accustomed to from the franchise and WOW there was so much killing/shooting in this installment, I actually was kind of surprised by that. The killings were more than I have ever seen during this series. There was a little girl sitting in front of me and I could only imagine her mother regret for bringing her to see this particular movie. Some positives was the action scenes were typical Indian Jones flare and were exciting and enjoyable. I must say the character Helena was not likable, but maybe she wasn't meant to be and the young boy in the movie seemed thrown into the script, not much added value in my opinion. It was nice seeing some cameo appearances and the final scenes were heartwarming. I don't regret going to see the movie because it is the last film in the series and I needed to see the film on the big screen, but if you are a true fan of the series like I am I suggest you go to the theater and send Indy off for ol times sake :)","

"bosullivan2-719-143250","28 June 2023","Delighted to see Indy on the big screen again and have the chance to take my kids to see such an iconic legend. It's great fun. A bit long, maybe scary for kids in places (but exactly what you want from an Indiana Jones movie!) and IMO ending pays off with a big surprise. (Go see it before someone who doesn't like it ruins it for you!)The movie starts off great. There's a bit of uncanny valley with the de-aging, but the scene itself is so much fun and classic Indy back fighting Nazi's and you know it's Harrison Ford for real, which makes it so much more powerful.Once we jump forward we see an older Indy now forced to face the new age of the moon landing and space fanatics. He's tired, grumpy and fed-up with life. What's there to live for? Well thank God there's another adventure around the corner waiting for him! Phoebe waller-bridge is the new sidekick for Indy who sets everything in motion. No one is ever going to beat Sean Connery in that role, but Phoebe does her best and you believe their relationship for the most part. It's not perfect, their banter isn't hilariously funny and emotional, but it does not ruin the movie, and Phoebe is a perfectly well equipped actor to keep up with Harrison and join in on the action. (Ignore the haters. She is not as annoying or over bearing as they make out.)The new bad guys led by Casino Royal's Mads Mikkelsen and ruthless henchman Boyd Holbrook from Logan, are ferocious brutal killers, in the most horrible sense. They shoot innocent people in cold blood too often for my liking in a family adventure movie, but are worthy foes for Indy to battle against, and you do find yourself on the edge of your seat when Indy is on the run from them or fighting them.This is where some people may have gripes with the film, which is Indy can't physically take them on, due to his age, so just runs away instead or chases them in a car, but then he's no problem jumping from cars to horses to gain the upper hand, which is fine, Harrison is magnificent, but if we're going to play the age card, I'd like to see Indy outwit the bad guys too with his book-smarts & experience, trapping the bad guys in a cave full of skeletons or spiders, if even just to slow them down, without changing the overall outcome.Nonetheless, Indy's last action adventure is a whip roaring one from start to finish. It's incredible to see Harrison donning the famous fedora again, taking on Nazi's and exploring creepy caves and getting himself in way over his head, as always! It's not Raiders or Last Crusade. Definitely not Kingdom. Just a great mad new adventure. To be enjoyed on the big screen with the amazing John William's score that's guaranteed to get you in the mood for another spine tingling adventure.","

"Sunsphxsuns","30 June 2023","It's been 42 years since the release of ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in 1981. Our world has changed quite a lot since then, but not enough to dismiss the vitality and charm of what is likely Indiana Jone's final adventure. And it's a worthy one at that!""Dial of Destiny"" feels very much like a Spielberg/Lucas collaboration without the aforementioned genius duo at the helm. And perhaps this is the film's most redeeming charm: It has the look and excitement of the familiar globe-trotting universe we've come to expect for Indy and his legendary exploits. Yes, Indy is older, and far more physically and emotionally vulnerable than before. Perhaps this is art imitating life. And why not? Isn't that how life actually works?Don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you from screening this film. It's worth every dollar, and perhaps more, because it is likely the last time you'll see Harrison Ford portray this hugely iconic character.No spoilers here as usual, however, after viewing Dial of Destiny, Steven Spielberg quipped to the people seated next to him: ""Damn! I thought I was the only one who knew how to make one of these!""","

"shenzencowboy","2 July 2023","I completely disagree with the lukewarm reviews for this film and thought it was a terrific romp and a great return to form. I don't know what you have to do to please some people. It keeps you engaged the entire time and takes you back to the good old days when Raiders first came out. It's a definite return to form after some very average films in the series.The technology is clever and used superbly. It's wonderful to see some of the old cast members again plus a few new stars. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is wonderful with the right mix of comedy and drama. There was a great rapport between the two lead characters.They wrapped up the series beautifully. It's fascinating that the storyline has an element of truth in that the focus of the movie actually exists and is one of the great mysteries.People can be overly critical but I went along for the ride and loved it. It made me remember how much I loved the first in the series. The entire cast did a great job. It's not Citizen Kane but it's a highly entertaining, rewarding final episode.","

"chris_rowe-881-168820","30 June 2023","I'm extremely tired of seeing endless franchises rehashed, reimagined or just remade, or completely unnecessarily added to and this is the latest example. I took my dad for a belated Father's Day and this was the completion of seeing each film on launch day, which was cool.Let's start with the obvious, casting, it was awful, from the friend played by the usually great Toby Jones, he seemed the wrong fit for bumbling charming professional. But it gets far worse, the young lad was awful, his acting was genuinely terrible and I don't care he's young, I've seen so many phenomenal kid performances in this age that at this level, his performance was just not good.Then we have PWB, a woman who made 12 episodes of a tedious self absorbed sitcom that got massively overrated, she may have talent behind the screens, but her acting roles have been the posh girl in most things, so to keep celebrating her as a top actress is ridiculous, she plays 1 type of character and is completely impossible to like. Her confidence/ego we're obnoxious, her delivery is tedious and trying to act like she's 30 is ridiculous. She's 37 looking 40s. Completely the wrong cast and took away from what should've been a farewell, stealing the attention for what? A spin off? Was just groan inducing. I'll throw in that PWB is the most overhyped and overrated in this milenium.HF must've been really talked into this as either a vehicle to have a woman lead or just desperation from people who want money, he struggled with delivery, clearly wasn't mobile to a huge degree and this is no knock on him and his age but it made this film look a bit naff. That cgi young body they do is creepy and looks awful, from will smith to manifest, it looks rotten and unnatural. It was a lacklustre and pointless stain on a trilogy many find iconic.The ending, it was genuinely insane and spat all over logic, credibility and realism. Whilst I'm not knocking some of the science, this was written in the hope people will just smile and take it. It was nonsense, I mean the 1 in a billion chance they end up at that time aside, the fact that someone like indi wouldn't ruin history or alter things intentionally suddenly stay knowing it'd destroy history is ridiculous.Then the villain who's intelligent even though evil is so suddenly idiotic he mistakes that for the exact time in Sicily he wanted was just lazy, it would look nothing alike, it was done for the audience benefit and took away again from credibility and logic.This film is awful, it feels so so long, it drags, misses the mark and the writing is abysmal, some of the dialogue was just unforgivable and the casting killed any funny/warm or positive moments you expect in these adventures. Anyone who tells you this is good, doesn't have high standards for entertainment or quality.","

"ianandsarah1","4 December 2023","As a fan I wanted to feel joy and awe while figuratively traveling alongside Indy going on one last epic adventure. What I got was a big step down from all of his previous journeys, including Crystal Skull. Not to mention, as another commenter pointed, that deconstructing legacy characters/franchises didn't belong here. I think we've reached a point where such approaches to franchises robs certain sequels' purpose to any major series, which is to tell a story and not make it feel like some analytical term paper adapted in the form of a screenplay (eg Matrix Resurrections is a major guilty example of this folly).Also, when I said I wanted to feel awe and joy, this movie lacked those major attributes in exchange for melancholy and moroseness. None of the supporting even tried hard to give the movie any sense of levity. There was a kid, but he was no Short Round. In fact, killing off Mutt was a really dumb mistake. While he didn't have a warm reception, it doesn't mean he couldn't be improved in the follow-up, and killing him off was one aspect that brought the movie down. Oh yeah, he reunited with Marion in the end. But I didn't have any warm feelings of a happy reunion. In my head: ""Hi Marion. By the way, your son's dead."" It just reeks of studio interference. ""People don't like Mutt so just kill him off. I don't know how you do it, but just do it."" ""But I wrote a really good arc for him in the movie, and the fans are going to love him now."" ""Just do it already."" ""Okay fine. Jeez!"" I mean, he was only mentioned in conversation and then forgotten. We don't see a picture or him anywhere. Bad writing, if you ask me.Furthermore, the whole thing with characters dying on-screen made it a bit too dark and pointless. Why couldn't they have done something with time travel where Indy managed to save his colleagues and son from certain death. A nice Checkhov's gun moment. He goes back in time, and then...that's it. Would've been great if a big chunk of the climax was devoted to Indy stopping the Nazi man from changing history in any other time period, but an underwhelming anticlimactic plane crash would do.You know what would've been the best way to end the series? Atlantis! The ultimate lost ancient city teeming with valuable treasures and whatever mythical MacGuffin they're journeying toward would've been more eventful than a time-traveling Dial that was lame. Heck! Since this is supposed to be Indy's last on-screen adventure, it would've been great to Marion, Mutt, Sallah, Short-Round, and maybe another new travel buddy or two coming along for the biggest adventure that Dial lacked, and wasted it on an idea that was not fitting Indy (ie Just because it worked on Logan, it doesn't work for Indy). I mean, other than the Holy Grail, you can't get bigger than Atlantis. And they squandered it.","

"Ed-Shullivan","8 July 2023","Oh this was such a big disappointment on so many levels. Have we not been subjected over the past two decades with an inordinate number of endless (and I do mean endless!) car chases? In this case Harrison Ford is driving a vehicle commonly referred to as a three (3) wheel trike. Then we have to struggle with seeing the old geezer Harrison Ford make every effort as an octogenarian (he will turn 81 on July 13th) to run away from trouble with his much younger accomplice the 37 year old Phoebe Waller-Bridge. In comparison would anyone in their right mind want to still see a 74 year old Terry Bradshaw quarterback the Pittsburgh Steelers football game against the 37 year old Matt Ryan?I was so bored after the first 45 minutes of these endless chase scenes overflowing with CGI that when the end credits outlined the hundreds and more hundreds of animators and visual illustrators I was not surprised that this (5th) fifth and seemingly final Indiana Jones movie had no extra Easter Egg scenes after the credits start rolling because the film had already run long enough that the audience I attended with ALL left except for Mrs. Shullivan, her two sisters and myself before the end credits had finished.I am a big fan of sequels and trilogies and even franchises, and I have a big heart when it comes to embracing a character such as Indiana Jones. Did you know De-Aging Harrison Ford In Indiana Jones 5 Took 3 Years & 100+ VFX Artists? I think the producers of this fifth title in the franchise could have taken a page from the James Bond series and chosen a younger more agile Indiana Jones by film number five (5). Instead the producers decided in the third of the five film series, the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, they introduced an aging Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father. How ironic that instead of going younger, the producers chose to double down and go older in film number (3) three of their franchise.The feeling of adventure was lost on me, and I may be getting older, but I still know a bad movie when I am exposed to it and this fifth film in the franchise series was a big no for me.I can barely give it a 5 out of 10 IMDb rating.","

The production value of the sets, props, landscapes and s/vfx were outstanding. The score was the same as the original films, so that complimented this one. All casting and performances were spot-on. What dragged this film down was the the second act. The first and last acts were excellent and were as close to having the magic the earlier films had, but the middle act felt too long and dragged out, that made the 154 min runtime feel like it was much longer. Had the middle cut some of the filler out, I feel the entire film would've been more enjoyable. Nevertheless, a decent final installment and farewell to the franchise.","

"851222","25 December 2023","Greetings from Lithuania.""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" (2023) is a fun movie for a boring evening - or two. Two because at its running time 2 h 18 min this movie did drag. With a plot like this which was used and seen many times in different movies, the only thing that saved this movie for me was its technical stuff. This film is very impressive, special effects were solid and setting were great. There is a lot of action, and you have to leave a logic behind the door when watching it. The third act it basically Looney Tunes type of movie - the ridiculousness is on a next level here. But again, plenty of action, fun chase sequences, and sere scope of this film left me impressed.Overall, for me personally from all 5 movies this one is in number 4 - behind it is the one with aliens. ""Dial of Destiny"" is definitely not a bad movie and it looks spectacular - for example the de-aging effects in the opening sequence are simply perfect. What it lacks is better story and the ending was kinda meeehhhh. But for one evening this movie does its job - it entertains.","

"bastille-852-731547","29 June 2023","Modern blockbusters undoubtedly owe plenty of gratitude to Steven Spielberg's first three Indiana Jones films, particularly ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" They helped serve as a prototype for future blockbusters, blending action set pieces with a compelling lead hero, swagger, and a ton of fun. While they sometimes feel very much (often in a good way) of a product of their generation, they still are far more well-made and entertaining than the overwhelming majority of blockbuster sequels today. Unfortunately, the fourth film in the series, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" was rather unsatisfying. Fortunately, this final adventure for Harrison Ford mostly learns from the mistakes of that film, and while it's definitely not on the level of the first two and arguably the third film (how could it be?) it still is an incredibly fun and enjoyable adventure for fans of the series.After a riveting and action-packed prologue, this film is set in 1969 and concerns Indiana Jones' life as a professor. He's increasingly concerned that NASA is willing to hire former Nazis to advise them on aerospace matters. He partners up with his goddaughter Helena to help find a dial that has time travel powers, and prevent it from being placed into the hands of the former Nazis. The plot of ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is not exactly the most original, but even though Spielberg did not direct this installment, the unique trademarks of his films still come out in full force. There's whip-smart pacing and editing, clever line delivery, and an earnest emotional core between Indiana Jones and the people close to him. Despite being dramatically different tonally from James Mangold's earlier blockbuster ""Logan,"" this film actually shares a common theme about what it's like to be a hero looking into a rapidly changing world and worrying about being considered past his prime. The film's action setpieces are well-choreographed, thrilling, and engaging. They provide a sense of excitement and fun, but Mangold wisely makes sure they are never overbearing in relation to establishing a compelling and clever story. This storytelling is accentuated by strong performances. Despite his age (now 80,) Harrison Ford is just as charismatic and provides just a strong performance as Indy as ever. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is also very good as Helena, and Mads Mikkelsen is a creepily effective Nazi. The blend of action, humor, and dramatic stakes is thoroughly balanced over the 2.5 hour runtime, making the film thoroughly entertaining and never feeling tedious or overlong. A great score (John Williams is truly a legend!) and splendid period design of both late-1960s New York City and international locations help make the film more impactful and engaging. While not perfect, this is a highly entertaining blockbuster for those who love this franchise, and I believe that Spielberg would generally be proud of this installment. But above all, it's a great send-off to Harrison Ford in one of his most iconic roles, and a true blast of joy for fans of him as an actor to see him play Indy one last time. Gladly recommended. 7.5/10My ranking of the franchise is: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Last Crusade/Dial of Destiny (tie,) Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.","

"kbimadod","16 December 2023","This very sentence comes from the most annoying character of the movie, referring to Indy. And for the most part it's sadly true, he's not running the show. But he should be. Seemingly the writers for some reason failed to understand the essence of Indiana Jones. He's not supposed to be part of history, he needs to save it, preserve it. Yes he sees things that cannot be explained, magical, outworldly things, but he never loses sight of his calling: archeology: saving things that belong in a museum.An aging Indy should've opened many doors to highlight his experience, his wisdom, but unfortunately he needs to be saved far too often. Indy doesn't need to be saved! He's the one who saves the day!The story itself stays interesting, the casting is good, Harrison Ford still has it and there are scenes where the movie really shines, but sadly the creators misunderstood the core, the essence we grew to love.","

"classicsoncall","27 December 2023","I'm a little surprised at how the movie got panned by critics and seems to get the brush off here on IMDb. It actually rates a bit higher than 2008's 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', which doesn't put it dead last out of all five films of the franchise. Here's what I think - if one hadn't seen any of the other Indiana Jones flicks, I think this one would rate quite a bit better than it does now, a '6.6' at the time I write this. Yes, it's got a ludicrous time travel component to the story, but is that any crazier than getting chased by a huge boulder (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") or eating monkey brains (Temple of Doom')? I had a pretty good time with this one, starting right off with the escape from the Nazis and Dr. Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), and the quick transition to 1969 with the Beatles' 'Magical Mystery Tour'. The song's title heralded all that magical adventure to follow attempting to locate Archimedes' Antikythera, the legendary Dial of Destiny with the power to open fissures in time. At eighty-one years of age, Harrison Ford shows he's still got some gas in the engine when it comes to keeping up with the much younger cast. His character's reconciliation with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) at the finale was a nice way to bring the franchise to an end, and I think the filmmakers did a pretty good job of keeping the spirit of Indiana Jones alive through all of four decades. We even got to know Indy's real name, as I don't recall it ever being mentioned in any of the other stories. For those with the need to know, it was Henry Walton Jones, Jr.","

"adamjohns-42575","16 January 2024","Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny (5) (2023) -I had to wonder how many people left the cinema after seeing this film and said ""Bring back Shia LaBeouf"", because at least his character of Henry Jones Junior, Junior (Mutt) had been established in the previous film, 'Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull' (2008) and had some sort of appeal in his role.And actually, as someone who is not a fan of Phoebe Waller-Bridge and despite the fact that I had been warned about her role of Wombat/Helena I went in to watching this film with an open mind about it and I was coping with her being the one to dig Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) out of his funk,
but then she started to become too much during a tuk-tuk chase. She played things too cocky, more than a bit hammy and like an obstreperous child. I felt that Phoebe was just wholly inappropriate in so many ways and that 'Flavour of the month' syndrome had struck again. I could think of 100 actors that would have played the part better.What if it had been Mutt reprised? It wouldn't even have to be Shia, as long as it was his character, it was ten or more years later after all. But would I have thought it more correct? Probably.Or maybe Ke Huy Quan as Short Round could have reunited with Indy from his role in 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom' (1984)? Although it would have been gimmicky, at least his character fit the brief of a money obsessed rogue from Jones' past, that Phoebe tried and failed to be.Harrison did what he could in the title role, but that was far less than he used to, which was to be expected. However, I had to consider if he had just made this one to show that it really was the last time for him to play the character.His CGI'd version in the initial flashback scene wasn't wholly convincing either, especially when he moved in any way at all. I expected better from ILM (Industrial, Light @ Magic).During this scene I also felt that it was quite darkly filmed, which made it hard to see the action on the Nazi train.I have always liked it when Indiana has been fighting the Nazi's, but it was a stretch for them to still be the enemy in the late 60's, making it a bit like a 'Captain America' and 'Red Skull' storyline.In general it was a slow start to find out what was actually going on, what the treasure would be and what it might do, but I did like the slightly different tack it took due to Indiana being older so that the story had to be slowed a bit too. Although it was clear that they weren't killing and fighting as much and in such an obvious pausing way to avoid shooting the lead character straight away. There were numerous times where he/she/they should have all been defeated easily.I felt that if this film had been released as the second, third or even fourth instalment of the franchise, but in the 1980's when Harrison was still young enough to do his own stunts and BE the main character it might not have been such a disappointing episode and it did seem episodic too as if it could have been broken up in to a serial, which might have worked better for this particular story, likely with, a less high expectation for it as a result.If it had been filmed back then though, Wombat wouldn't have needed to be the action hero element and things might have flowed more like the typical Jones film. I'm not saying that she had to be a damsel in distress like Kate Capshaw's Willie character in 'Temple', because I loved Marion's (Karen Allen) involvement in more of the action in 'Crystal Skulls', but Wombat had clearly been created to take the slack from Harry, with Phoebe just wrongly cast to do that.The later time setting seemed to diminish the colour and excitement of the others that had gone before too. Things had moved on a bit too far for it to seem so nostalgic and historic. There wasn't the charm of the less advanced technology and so on.I did like the inclusion of an underwater element as something different to what we've seen before however and I didn't mind the time travel thing, although the way that it was done was a tad farcical. There were many other ways that a legend like Indiana Jones could have travelled in time without it being such a comic book delivery.I did think that it might have been better if they'd let the good Doctor stay in old Syracuse, as a way of wrapping up the series, especially as the epilogue with Marion was a bit naff.And I wasn't even sure that it needed the wonderful John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, although his presence didn't take anything away from the film, it didn't add much either.I will watch it again and it might grow on me and ultimately I didn't hate it, but they could definitely have done better, especially as it was surely the send off of the fantastic character we've all come to know and love.I don't think that it will ever rank that highly though and as I write more film reviews it will probably be one that I use as an example of what not to do, however if taken separately from the franchise and just considered on its own merit, it really had quite a good story and nobody performed sooo badly that it should be hated.648.07/1000.","

"traceytak","24 November 2023","Ok so I understand she is flavour of the month but this film became unwatchable as soon as she appeared in it. I loved the Indiana films up till this one and it started out good. Mars is great casting, he plays his part well. But the character played by Phoebe is just so unlikeable and horribly british (which I am too but she is an embarrassment in this) and I think there must be plenty of other actresses that could have played it far better. Maybe she just belongs in downtown abbey but she is very one sided. Harrison has the capability of doing a really good job but I'm sorry to say in this he was completely let down by his supporting actress.","

"deloudelouvain","25 December 2023","When I saw they released this new Indiana Jones movie I thought it was the perfect moment to rewatch the other four adventures. They all aged very well, very pleasant to rewatch, still as entertaining as the first time I watched them. I scored them all with an eight on here. So I was quite excited to see what Harrison Ford's mission would be this time. I mean he's not the youngest anymore but with some amazing computer tools they managed to make him look young again. It's quite scary they can do all this so easily nowadays, makes you wonder what you can believe or who can be trusted in the future as everything can be manipulated easily. This new adventure is of course again over the top but does this really matter with an Indiana Jones movie? If you can pass all that and you enjoyed the previous movies I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this one. So I really don't get some negative reviews for this one. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is this time the other main character and she did quite good. Antonio Banderas only has a very small role and was more a name on a poster, to attract more people, than anything else, but he still did a good job. I guess this time it was the last Indiana Jones movie, unless they can just film a movie with a complete fake Harrison Ford in the future, or if another actor plays his character. Indiana Jones is to me one of the most successful franchises, five movies, five great adventures.","

"Chalice_Of_Evil","7 August 2023","As if it weren't bad enough that Disney stubbornly refuses to release any of the MCU TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray anywhere in the world, now they've made it personal by announcing they're discontinuing DVDs/Blu-rays of *anything* being released in my country (and ONLY my country), with their final release being GotG Vol. 3 (seriously, they couldn't have made it something I'd actually want to watch?). So, if I wanted to see this movie, my options were wait several years for it to be on TV (I could've been DEAD by then!) or go see it at the theatre. Normally I'd have gone on opening day, but wasn't able to. After that, I wasn't feeling overly motivated to and was just going to wait for it on DVD/Blu-ray...but thanks to Disney, I no longer had that option. There's been much debate over CGI de-aging of actors, but it was fine here with Harrison Ford's Indy in a longer-than-expected flashback. Obviously they felt the de-aging would hold up to scrutiny, and for the most part it does (there were only a couple of times it felt slightly off). Toby Jones plays Basil Shaw, another in an apparently long line of Indy offsiders (and kind of useless...until he finally isn't). What surprised me was how not-terribly-exciting I found the whole opening sequence. While there's thankfully no 'nuke the fridge' moment, it stretches credulity how Indy miraculously survives being thrown about and an explosion directly beneath him whilst his neck's in a noose.Sadly, things don't get interesting until a good way through the movie. Before that, we catch up with old man Indy, who yells at his noisy neighbours, baseball bat in hand (I can relate), and is unaware that the only person attending his classes who actually KNOWS ANYTHING is his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), wishing to pick up where her father left off in search of this film's MacGuffin, the Antikythera (designed by Archimedes). After she reintroduces herself to Indy, it's not long before she's leaving him behind at the mercy of bad guys. While there is some action involving a parade and Indy riding a horse, I personally felt things didn't really get going until the scene that begins at a Tangier hotel, where Helena's attempting to auction off the half of the Dial she nicked. Regarding their two characters, I did feel they had a decent dynamic going on between them and Helena/Waller-Bridge isn't nearly as annoying as Willie was in Temple of Doom. People like to exaggerate the 'feminism' stuff, but she's just as 'feisty' as Marion was and has her moments where she acknowledges she's said/done something wrong. One of very few 'emotional' moments in the movie is during a scene where she asks what Indy would do if he could go back in time (which turns out to be the Antikythera's power) and he talks about the death of his son, Mutt (as if you needed more reason to watch this film, Shia LaBeoufhead's irritating character from the last movie unceremoniously being killed offscreen should be motivation enough. No more crappy CGI vine-swinging alongside monkeys for him!).While the character of Teddy (this film's version of Short Round, who some people are making out Teddy can't hold a candle to...but I think they're forgetting just how thoroughly annoying that kid was and are only forgiving of him now because the actor who played him grew up to kick butt in Everything Everywhere All At Once and won an Oscar) isn't really necessary, at least he proves himself *useful* (just don't bother questioning how this thief can fly a plane with no prior experience) and doesn't YELL ALL HIS LINES like Short Round did. It's too bad Sallah wasn't the third member of the team instead (while it's good to see John Rhys-Davies return in the role, he's out of the movie pretty quick and only returns at the very end). Still, at least he doesn't feel as wasted as Antonio Banderas does playing yet another old friend of Indy's. What was the point of him exactly? Same can be said for Mason, the most unlikely FBI Agent to be working with German scientist/astrophysicist and ""former"" Nazi, Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen, who can basically play a villain in his sleep by this point). Rather than so many side characters, I think the movie would've been better to just focus on Indy and Helena's relationship, as it seems like we're only just getting a feel for them as a pair by the time the film reaches its conclusion.Speaking of...yes, there *is* time-travel involved (and yet it's still somehow easier to swallow than aliens). There have been eyeroll-worthy objections to Helena 'robbing Indy of his agency' in the scene where he just wishes to be left to die in the past (after actually meeting Archimedes himself), but Indy was being a stubborn fool who was risking screwing up reality, so her punching his lights out to get him back to his time was warranted. Likewise, people may be disappointed that the baddie doesn't suffer a horrific fate like main villains of the past films, but it's more about him realising how screwed his grand plan is (and, hey, if that isn't enough...we see his crispified corpse later). In the end, things are made 'right' again when Indy gets back together with Marion (complete with callback), after their marriage fell apart following Mutt's death. Anyone worrying about Helena taking over from Indy needn't get their panties in a bunch if the final shot of him snatching his iconic fedora off a clothesline is any indication. While this movie certainly doesn't reach the 'classic' status of Raiders or Last Crusade, the best praise I can give it is that at least it's not as ridiculous as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which, much like the Star Wars prequels, it seems people are now pretending is some misunderstood masterpiece) or as gross as Temple of Doom. It's not 'bad'...just kinda boring.","

"EpicMovieCompilations","29 June 2023","Indiana Jones survives the events of his fifth adventure, yet the character George Lucas and Steven Spielberg brought to life in 1981 dies, well and truly... It's a shameful paradox Disney have orchestrated for the once-iconic part-time professor, in his dreary, uninspiring, dime-a-dozen ""send-off""... Producer Kathleen Kennedy and Director James Mangold are primarily to blame, as are stars Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Broadly, the biggest problem I can point to, right off-the-bat, is the plot itself. If this is sincerely to be the last time we'll ever see Indiana Jones (which it certainly is) why choose to tell THIS particular story?Apparently, there's a titular dial called Antikythera, invented by the Syracusan mathematician Archimedes, capable of ""locating fissures in time"". That's how the movie explains it early on anyway, as if they're embarrassed to flat-out call it time-travel... The prologue features a de-aged Harrison Ford, up to some vintage shenanigans aboard a train in Germany, and look, I guess this scene tricks you into believing it's an actual Indiana Jones movie (briefly, mind you). Thomas Kretschmann shows up as a Nazi Lieutenant, and by all accounts, is the best antagonist in the movie. Meanwhile, Mads Mikkelson has his talents as an actor relegated by big-budget studios (yet again), opting to have him play a substandard villain instead. Just as baffling, is Boyd Holbrook's presence. A good actor, proving his chops as the bad guy in another James Mangold-directed feature, Logan (2017) - here given absolutely zero to do besides chase Indiana Jones and fire-off his pistol occasionally. Shaunette Renée Wilson appears solely to fill Disney's ethnic quota. That surely reads harsh, but I see no narrative purpose for her character. She's on the fence about the true allegiances of the U. S Agents she's working alongside... Then gets betrayed. This ties-up which plot-thread exactly? We already know Dr. Voller is a Nazi, so why play catch-up with her? The movie runs over two hours and thirty minutes due to filler like this... Antonio Banderas gets five minutes of screen-time before getting shot dead. Was there any reason Disney hired an actor of this caliber for such a minor role? He could've easily portrayed a major ally, as opposed to John Rhys Davies, reprising his role as Sallah for a lethargic, barely limber cameo. Ethann Isidore plays a discount Short-Round (Ke Huy Quan) called Teddy, who's also an adequate pilot. It's like the movie's aware of how farcical a detail this is, so near the finale, a military flyer happens to be sleeping in the back of a plane this kid commandeers. A military flyer. Sleeping in the back of a WWII-era bomber... How convenient. God forbid Teddy needs assistance up there... By the way, Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, Helena Shaw, somehow knows they'll need another flight back from 212 B. C (more on that later) so instructs for Teddy, her sidekick, to hijack that aircraft in particular. She doesn't accompany Teddy though, but finds a motorcycle on which she can pursue Indiana Jones, captive onboard another plane, mid take-off... The convolution cannot be overstated. Why not go with the kid on his first-ever flight? What you're left with is a logical error, that needed to be resolved during rewrites.Phoebe Waller-Bridge has no business appearing in an Indiana Jones movie, at least not to this specific capacity. She can be endearing, had the writers attempted to present her in such a light, and her wry sense of humour from Fleabag (2016 - 2019) doesn't necessarily come in handy here. ""Resourceful, daring, beautiful, self-sufficient"" is how Helena Shaw describes herself, verbatim, during a boring chase sequence through Tangier. This description is contrived enough to make a sensible audience member roll their eyes, and then, worse still, unnatural enough to take you out of the moment. Dangerous high-speed scenario, yeah? But forget about that for a sec, Helena needs to list-off her best feminine traits... Kathleen Kennedy won't tolerate subtlety I guess.The movie's budget allegedly tops-off at 300 Million Dollars, U. S. And in every major shot, from the trailers and in the final product, unfortunately, I can identify the subpar CGI, blatant green-screens and unconvincing body-doubles... It's unacceptable. There's a scuba diving sequence which isn't filmed underwater for instance. Take a VFX shot from any of the previous four movies, yes, even Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)... And I guarantee you, they'll be of a higher quality than what is presented here. Apparently, Disney's VFX Artists are underpaid, but I still can't wrap my head around those 300 Million Dollars... Where'd the money go? And who knew an Indiana Jones movie could look so ugly? It makes all those snide complaints about CGI prairie-dogs in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) seem redundant.Furthermore, The Dial of Destiny (2023) makes it abundantly clear how underrated Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is anyway. Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) is nowhere to be found, and declined to return around the same time Steven Spielberg bowed out. The film chalks-up Mutt's absence to an off-screen death whilst serving in Vietnam - also the root cause of Indy's alcoholism and break-up with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), believe it or not. The narrative through-line between the fourth and fifth movies just feels jarring as a result. We literally end Kingdom (2008) with a wedding and open The Dial of Destiny (2023) with a divorce..? I'm sorry, did I miss something? Could this same exact story have occurred with Mutt and Marion by Indy's side? Absolutely. What's with this trending creative urge to make old heroes depressed? It doesn't elevate any of the material here, and that's a shame, because Harrison Ford tries his best to accomodate the forced screenplay... What a waste. I guess the focus needs to be on Indy and his goddaughter, yet their relationship isn't particularly involving. Just conceptually even, it's a stretch. ""Goddaughter""? She might as well be his next-door neighbour.The climax is where I gave up. Indiana Jones travels back in time to 212 B. C and witnesses the Siege of Syracuse. The whole set-piece is ugly and overproduced. Sure, the finales of Indiana Jones movies have generally been outlandish... And yet, they remain tasteful. They're guided by Spielberg's direction and Lucas's imagination... I can't imagine they'd ever concoct something like this though. And they've been known to go wild, too... But you need to know how and why you're going wild. James Mangold has no clue, and thus crosses the line into pure, unadulterated nonsense. Aesthetically, none of these images can fit-in with the rest of the series... Antikythera is revealed to be a one-way time portal only... And yet, Indiana Jones begs Helena Shaw to leave him at this place and moment in time, inexplicably. Because what else could be waiting for him in 1969, after-all? He drinks in excess, his wife's left him and his son's died sometime after enlisting in Vietnam... Just to ""piss him off"", apparently. I could've sworn they overcame any hard feelings by the end of Kingdom (2008)... Anyway, Helena insists there's no reason for him to remain in 212 B. C either, and the audience agrees with her for all the wrong reasons. Helena shouldn't have to convince Indiana Jones, a scientist, first and foremost, of the potential ramifications in disturbing the space-time continuum. She shouldn't have to knock him out either. Again, a creative detour I'm sure Kathleen Kennedy had complete control over. Did nobody at Lucasfilm think to maybe oppose that gesture? Is Helena punching Indiana supposed to be funny, noble, selfish or heroic? I'm not sure. Neither was anyone behind the camera. Indiana Jones wakes up in his New York City apartment, where Marion Ravenwood returns bearing groceries. She'd been called over by Helena, a person she's never met in her life, to rekindle the ageing flame with her former spouse... Indy and Marion then reenact the scene from the ship in Raiders (1981), in what is potentially the most uncomfortable, nostalgia-pandering conclusion they could've gone for... Yikes.Lucas' and Spielberg's departures were the first red flag. The actual preamble didn't instil anybody with much hope either, especially after those woeful early reviews from Cannes... I was optimistic. I had to be. John Williams was gonna be scoring after-all. The soundtrack itself is nothing remarkable, and that's almost a positive commentary, when the film it's attached to is so mournful.","

"adamcomito","3 September 2023","Firstly I feel they've done well to capture the old feel of the Indy movies, something they missed with crystal skull. Perhaps because Shia LaBeouf isn't trying to steal every scene. I'm glad he's not in this one.People are too harsh on this film, remember nearly 40 years have passed since the original trilogy. I love seeing the old European towns, also feels a little more grounded in reality than the last installment. Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger and I'm glad they played him as age appropriate. I just wish we'd get more Indy films but sadly this could be the last for Harrison.I get nostalgic watching this film, a great and worthy finish to a great action adventure series. Something we don't get much anymore in modern cinema.","

"shoebsaad","1 July 2023","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" delivers a thrilling escapade that will satisfy fans of the legendary archaeologist while introducing some exciting new elements. Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original trilogy, the film manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring icon.Harrison Ford once again dons the fedora with charisma and gusto, effortlessly slipping back into the role that made him a cinematic legend. Indy's witty one-liners, daring stunts, and unrivaled passion for history remind us why he remains an iconic figure in the world of adventure cinema.The film's plot centers around the mysterious Dial of Destiny, a mythical artifact with the power to reveal hidden truths from ancient civilizations. This time, Indiana Jones finds himself racing against ruthless adversaries and deciphering cryptic clues to unlock the dial's secrets before they fall into the wrong hands. The story weaves a web of intrigue, unearthing long-lost secrets and uncharted territories that will keep audiences engrossed from start to finish.While the action sequences are well-executed and maintain the classic Indiana Jones charm, some scenes may feel familiar to long-time fans. The film occasionally relies on tried-and-tested tropes from the franchise, missing an opportunity to push the boundaries of the character's adventures. However, the nostalgic factor will undoubtedly please those seeking the familiar thrill of an Indiana Jones film.In ""Dial of Destiny,"" the supporting cast shines, adding depth and diversity to the story. A standout performance comes from a skilled and talented Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose character brings a fresh perspective to the adventure and complements Indy's daring spirit.The movie's attention to historical detail is commendable, immersing audiences in various cultures and ancient civilizations. From sprawling temples to treacherous booby traps, the film beautifully captures the essence of these locations, offering a sense of authenticity to the breathtaking visuals.""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is an enjoyable film that will appease die-hard fans of the franchise looking for a taste of the iconic adventurer's escapades. However, it lacks the ingenuity and emotional depth that made the original trilogy stand out. While it's not a groundbreaking addition to the series, it still offers some entertaining moments and pays homage to the timeless hero that is Indiana Jones. If you're a fan of the character, you'll likely find enough to enjoy, but don't expect this adventure to leave a lasting impression.","

"mm-39","28 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was actually better than I thought it would be! I did come in with low expectations! Many fans of the Raiders series wondered will Woke Hollywood ruin another movie with forced awkward characters, and a disjoined preachy script which creates a collage of collective mush! Instead the last installment stayed true mostly to the 40's style action thriller. What worked: The start with a younger Jones with the action fight with the Nazi's over an artifact on a train is right out of the original Raiders movie. The middle works with an older Jones in the late 60's going threw the motions of acidemia only could be pulled off by a grouchy Harrison Ford. The bad guy who shares similarities to Wernher von Braun as a rocket scientist is a great bad guy. Smart as Jones, but has an evil similarity too Toht character of the original. Many little other formulated throw backs to the original is a nice with the film. The ending with the space time twist has a brilliant Quentin Tarantino style ending! What did not work: The Helena charter is the annoying person one asks is she going be at the party I hope not; But the Helena character helps push the story forward. The side kick kid is just as annoying like the screaming kid from temple of doom. The predictable chases, and the two weaker mentioned character mix into are story like cement causing story drag. Not perfect like the Original, but still hits the Raiders mark. 7 out of 10 stars.","

"SafReviews","29 September 2023","The movie was a bit better than I expected because it did start off well with Indiana once again up against the Germans in the third reich time period, but for me that was where the movie peaked as the story became less interesting as it went on. The movie did become a bit more intriguing when they time travelled back to the Roman empire time period which was kind of cool to see, but the damage was already done as most of the movie was just generic. I also wasn't a fan of the character Helena who I felt was unreliable and unlikeable. I even didn't like Teddy as I felt he wasn't charismatic enough and felt like he wasn't needed in the story. On the plus side at least it was better than the Crystal Skull.","

I was so relieved as being an Indie fan it was a worry that it wouldn't be as good. Definitely worth seeing at the pictures. There are some real brilliant bits to this movie. It's quite emotional watching it. I don't want Indie getting old but he isn't immortal. We have all been on the journey with him. There is only one Indie and that's Harrison Ford.

"mohnomachado","2 July 2023","This was such a fun ride compared to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Despite this being one of the longer Indiana Jones films, I actually found the pacing quite smooth, especially during the action sequences. The de-aging looked great and it was wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in the saddle. He was probably the best part about the movie, which is saying a lot considering John Williams comes back again to deliver a memorable score. I think some side characters are throw away, the villain is cartoony (yet Mads Mikelsen always remains fascinating as a villain), and the slower scenes tend to run long, but if you are a fan of Ford and this franchise, this is a much watch. Also, Mangold is no Spielberg (and he shouldn't have to copy him to receive praise!), but I thought those action scenes were well choreographed. Good work.","

We have all seen fights on trains in much better quality 15 years ago and the fact that it takes place during darkness in order to cover up atrocious CGI makes at even worse! Fleabag Waller-Bridge is the most despicable character they could have found! Annoying, unattractive and unfunny!

"kindofblue-78221","27 December 2023","Let's be clear Harrison was 80 when the film was made.How do people expect a man of this age to look?He's very very fit considering. I'd take his agility now and I'm 19 years his junior.I love parts 1-3 of the series. Part 4 doesn't count for me.I expected more of the same with part 5. Instead we get a brilliant nonstop ride through the world
It's great fun. Harrison is on top form.Yes I was surprised he agreed to do the film. You can't turn back time even in indies world
Or can they?Indy is really does manage to do much more than he has any right to do.The cgi aging is done well too.Those who comment on Harrison shouid revisit their attitudes when they approach 80 years of age.This fine is a fine addition.It's not the embarrment I expected.Harrison plays his part with the respect and attention I expect from a man of his calibre.Even at age 80 he's more of a film star than the majority of young actors around today.They should learn from him as shouid those who disparage him.This film doesn't try and turn back time.It actually respects time and age.A rarity even in so called tolerant times such as these.","

Rebooting some characters and creating new ones we have never seen before.The cruelty of bad guys was untypical to the series. Previously there were punches and fists. Now there are dead bodies and I did not like it.Mads Mickelsen is always perfect in such roles of conflicted people. People of power. I love his acting and he is now at his best. I enjoy every movie he plays in. Sometimes better than main characters.Now the first lady in the movie. Completely poor casting and completely thin character. Hard to like her. And the young Indian assistant is simply boring. Again Germans angainst some political correct boy. I do not like such forced casting and story telling. It is nauseing. Feel like vomit.The story is coherent. And theme intriguing. Poorely exploited. Much better the movie than the Skull which was simply.... strange. But I enjoyed Shya Le Bauf.I miss the attempt to rescue Indy's son however I assume this hat grabbing might be getting back to the game.Again I saw a product not a movie.","

"niallh-66092","3 July 2023","Who was this film made for? Who wanted to see a depressed Indy hobbling around while a self righteous know it all spends the entire runtime reminding him how old he is? Was this film made for an audience of exclusively Kathleen Kennedy?And who decided to put Pheobe Waller Bridge in this movie? I genuinely feel like Disney is desperate for this girl to become a thing, but she is just unlikeable. And it doesn't help when you have her play an insufferable character who constantly makes 2023 comments in a movie set in the 60s, you may as well have told her to wink at the camera. I wanna say anyone else in the role couldve done a better job, but I'm not even sure about that. The character is just awful.Also how many times do I need to get excited for a villain played by Mads Mikkelson for him to be yet again wasted? I'm amazed he doesnt get sick of it himself. Dont bother with this one. Its not worth your time.","

"georgewhittingham1","28 June 2023","I've just left the cinema feeling slightly underwhelmed, and very confused.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels in many ways, like an old Indiana movie.It's wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in his best role, even if he does look far too old to be undertaking even half the things in the film.There's some solid nostalgia and references to the old films, with a few old characters popping up, and our new characters actually did a pretty good job. Mads Mikklesen, is an ok villain, if not very shallow, but personally the star is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who shines throughout giving us constant jokes with a cheeky smile.The score was brilliant as to be expected, which accompanies car chases, ancient ruins, action scenes and all the rest. The humour is on point, it's never boring, and everything moves at a very steady pace.The first 3/4 of the movie are pretty great, and at this point I would have probably given it a 7/7.5 out of 10.But... the ending of the film is just confusing, and very underwhelming. I won't obviously give anything away, but my wife and I both said we'd really appreciate a 20 minute YouTube video explaining what on earth happened, and how did they get there?It's worth a trip to the cinema, and great to see Indiana back on our screens one final time, but it will leave you feeling rather empty inside. 6.5 / 10.","

"User145111","4 January 2024","A mixed bag of a movie. It was okay in some places but there is a disconnect between what is said and what happens. Indi can jump between vehicles but has trouble climbing up a rock-face. Is he too old for this or not? Characters are introduced that are allegedly a large part of Indi's life but he doesn't have a connection to them at all; at least it doesn't seem like it. Helena is painfully unlikeable and seems more like the villain of the piece instead of the deuteragonist. Just let Indi live in the past. It's all he's ever wanted.The de-aging is passable at times, such as in long shots or when seen in relative darkness, but can falter from time to time. Hearing 80 year-old Harrison Ford's voice coming out of 46 year-old Indiana Jones is incredibly distracting. Sallah should have been in more of the film instead of just as a glorified cameo. Killing of Indi's son was the best thing that could have happened to that character.","

"smitastic","5 July 2023","I saw this on the day before the official release, and unfortunately this is the worst of the 5 movies. Yes, Crystal Skull is better. The first 20 minutes, (the flashback scene), are good, and then it's downhill from there. The movie is clearly missing Spielberg's touch and the whole movie didn't feel like an Indiana Jones film. Lots of action with no memorable scenes and weak new characters you don't care about. Indy is a grumpy old man that has his goddaughter bossing him around and upstaging him at every turn. The brilliant and courageous Indy of the previous four movies, is just a dopey old man that no one would have watched in any movie. After leaving the theater I really couldn't recall anything worth remembering and had the feeling that they probably should have not made this movie at all! Should have ended it with Crystal Skull. Now we'll get Helena Indy spinoff, yay!","

"bhernandez2216","30 June 2023","As a die hard Indiana Jones fan, it was worth a watch and it was pretty fun and entertaining in most parts. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, sure did added a lot of action, and has heart, and also some good classic vibe moments and pretty a little bit of humor, but there are some moments that went pretty shaky and some pretty much funny looking poor CGI effects!I would prefer 3 original Indiana Jones movies along with legendary Harrison Ford who did a really great job playing his legendary Indiana Jones as always, view years later. And Steven Spielberg was an incredible filmmaker, without a doubt. And legendary John Williams with his score was beautiful well done and brings so many good score vibes with his best theme music composing skills that would reveal his music identity!Harrison Ford is at his best as Indiana Jones, and Mads Mikkelsen also did a good job playing the villain, also have to give credits to Karen Allen, Antonio Banderas, and John Rhys-Davies, they did a really good job with there performances, but Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for me on the other hand, I think she ruined the whole movie with her character and other new characters that I do not find entertaining or interesting.I gotta admit, James Mangold who made ""Logan"", ""Ford v Ferrari"", and ""the Wolverine"" did a pretty good job directing it, but Kathleen Kennedy on the other hand, I never trusted her for what she has done over the years, sense she likes to ruin Star Wars and Lucasfilm view years back ever sense! Like she ruined ""The Last Jedi"" and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" those were so incredibly bad! So I despise her for ruining Lucasfilm and I really hope she retires or get fired from Hollywood for good!But like I said, it was worth a watch. So I just wanted to say congratulations to Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, and John Williams for bringing the best moments that was so magical and enjoyable for me. The Adventure... never dies!6/10.","

"jamesjustice-92","8 September 2023","It's been a long time since I first got myself a pirate VHS copy of The kingdom of the crystal skull and sank into it. Ever since childhood Indiana Jones was one of my favorite characters, the sole reason I became interested in archeology and everything ancient and Harrison Ford was there to guide me in my passion for history. The first three movies were masterpieces of entertainment hands down, the fourth was, well, a different, almost an alien piece of work but it was driven by the energy of father and son relationship hence it was also a good fun movie.As I sat and watched The dial of destiny I felt the movie's alien nature once again only this time it was in a bad way. Don't get me wrong it's filled with action to the brim, so much so that if you blink you'll miss some fantastic eye-dropping shot but all in all it is a bland uninspired body of work written by four people and none of them was George Lucas or Steven Spielberg.The dial of destiny could have easily been a different movie if it hadn't had Indiana Jones before it and that name alone should put a stamp of high quality on it which there wasn't. The characters are dumb and have no motivation, no stamina, no nothing to hold onto; the villains are your usual goonies with half a brain and even Mads Mikkelsen wasn't able to bring life to his just another ex-Nazi character with God's syndrome.Harrison Ford himself is old and tired as his character who should have been retired many years ago; he clearly didn't want to be Indiana Jones anymore, as much as Han Solo and he shows it in every frame with his wooden acting and one facial expression.Yes, they added a tea spoon of drama to Indiana but forgot to pour tea first which in the end turned out to be a sugary sweet version of a farewell party for Jones and Co. The adventure is mind-blowing though and the scene in Syracuse is absolutely the best part of the whole movie but overall The dial of destiny is pretty forgettable and it is an unnecessary addition to the world of the greatest archeologist with a whip and a hat but I nevertheless am glad this movie happened - to prove once again that Hollywood can never make a worthy continuation of an iconic movie.","

"dtucker86","30 June 2023","Who would have ever guessed when the first Raiders was released 42 summers ago that a movie about a man with a bullwhip and fedora named ""Indiana Jones"" would become a blockbuster hit spawning one of the most beloved and longest running franchises in cinema history. I was in junior high when Raiders came out and am now just seven years away from being eligible for Social Security. I wanted to mention a bit of trivia. Back in 1989 when Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade came out Sean Connery was cast as his father and played him as a doddering helpless old man, Connery was only 59 at the time and Harrison Ford did this movie when he was 80 years old an amazing accomplishment by any standards.There has been so much written about the prologue to the film set during the waning days of World War II as Indiana Jones and his friend Basil infiltrate a Nazi train to try to get Archimedes ""dial of destiny"" that can allow one to travel through time. In those twenty minutes there is enough action for several movies and the CGI ""deaging"" is very effective. After the dynamite beginning the movie moves forward over twenty years in time. It is now 1969 and those years certainly haven't been kind to Jones. In the original he was a dashing professor/adventurer a combination of Clark Kent and Superman. Now he is an old broken man, the old grouch next door yelling at his neighbors to turn their music down while seasoning his coffee with whiskey as he mourns the breakup of his marriage and the death of his son in Vietnam (oh well ""Mutt"" was a pretty loathsome contemptable character that almost no one liked anyway and Shia Lebouef is a terrible actor). His students now doze through his lectures, after all who wants to hear about archeology in the age where men are landing on the moon. His colleagues throw him a retirement party where he is ushered out the door with his only reward being a cheap clock he gives to a homeless person.Poor Indiana Jones is past his ""sell by"" date and has become an anachronistic bore. This is technically a good and exciting movie but the original was shoulders above and not nearly as depressing. The writers of this film lean very heavily on the nostalgia factor rather then trying to be original for example we have Indy having a reunion with his old pal Salla who mourns the good old days of adventure they once shared only for Indy to say they are gone forever. Ford does get a chance to ""act"" more then in the other films especially the scene where he shares his grief over his son's death and his regrets of a somewhat misbegotten life in pursuit of treasures while not appreciating what really matters. There is a humerous reference to his fear of snakes of course (only in this case it involves giant eels that just look like snakes).Madds MIkkelsen is a fine actor who has the distinction now of playing Doctor Hannibal Lecter on the tv series, a villain in a Bond film and now a villain in an Indiana Jones films my what a distinction! He gives a great performance and reminds me a little of the Nazi Toht the character that Ronald Lacey played in the original Raiders. There is also a nod in the movie to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom featuring a street kid who reminds you of Short Round, only he is not likeable at all just a little punk who annoyed the hell out of me. English character actor Basil Jones does a delightfully hammy turn as Indy's sidekick during the opening.This is the first Indy movie where Spielberg is not in the director's chair but James Mangold does a good job filling his shoes. Mangold is actually an acclaimed director in his own right his most famous film was I Walk The Line About Johnny Cash. He also directed Stallone in Cop Land and Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day. He handles the action scenes with expert aplomb such as the horse and the subway scene.Phoebe Waller Bridge does a commendable job as Jones goddaughter and his companion on the adventure. My only complaint is she is somewhat of a immoral schemer and not very likeable. Many have commented about the ending of the movie being ridiculous as the Dial of Destiny malfunctions and sends Indy and the others back to 213 BC during the Siege of Rome. Oh well at least he got to meet his hero Archimedes. By the way, the whole audience in the theatre laughed when Bridge delivered that ""punch of love"" so Indy could go back to the present.The final part of the movie is the most touchng featuring a cameo by Karen Allen (a great actress who has never been given the credit she deserves) as Marion and Indy reunite and it seems there is hope for their future as in the twilight of their years they recreate a scene from the original that really warmed my nostalgic heart. For some reason the film closes on a bizarre closeup of Indy's hat! Its been a helluva ride Indiana Jones enjoy your afternoon naps and your golden years and may your demons be at rest.","

"kezman436","17 October 2023","Tonally, technically and aesthetically, I felt it was very competent, and reminiscent of the franchise. However, I don't think the nuts and bolts of the plot and the Dial were elaborated, distinctive or engaging enough. The plot felt more like a hollow vehicle for set pieces.Longer than necessary in my opinion, and not sure if they strayed far enough from the 'race against the Nazis for treasure' formula. Jones' allies in this film weren't hugely memorable, and made me realise the importance of entertaining allies in previous instalments.I think overall, they didn't get the tone quite right for what should have been a loving celebration.","

"Richard-Nathan","2 December 2023","I had thought it would be impossible to produce an Indiana Jones movie that was worse than ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull,"" but I was wrong. ""Skull"" was only 2 hours and 2 minutes in length. ""Dial of Destiny"" was 2 hour and 34 minutes of tedium. It had no charm, no wit, not enough action, and all the characters were unlikeable. There is something dreadfully wrong with a film when you like the Nazi more than you like the hero's sidekick (and I say that as a man who considers himself a feminist).If you want to watch a model film about a hero who is past his prime, please watch ""Robin and Marian.""","

"markovd111","9 July 2023","As all of you who are reading reviews of this movie on this site, I am a fan of the character and the movie series. I grew up with them and constantly watched them while growing up making numerous memories and bonding with whoever I watched it with. I am a devoted fan as much as you are.I was scared of the fifth movie. The fourth one was bad and with Ford's age and current trends in Hollywood, I really expected a mediocre blockbuster which at best you watch for fun and forget soon after. I was ready to be disappointed due to bad to mediocre reviews and rumours. Yet, despite that, me and my brother decided to go to the cinema and watch the movie for fun and judge it ourselves.Sure, I could nitpick. I could tell you the movie is too long. I could tell you that digital de-aging used in the movie's intro (despite it's cost and technological achievement) often looks like you are watching a video game/animated movie character running around. I could tell you that some action scenes are too over the top even for the franchise itself. I could tell you that it takes too long to get used to some of the characters and so on, and so on...But I could also tell you that a big warm smile from ear to ear was on my and my brother's face when the credits rolled and legendary John William's theme started playing. I was literally overflown with emotion and could cry from the feelings movie made me feel as a fan. I personally think that, even though it's obvious, undeniable and also unquestionably natural that the movie is a big nostalgia bait/trip, it's far more than a simple try to cash in on aforementioned nostalgia. The way I see it, the movie approaches both it's main character and the actor behind it, Harrison Ford, and the whole movie franchise and it's universe and characters with a lot of respect, thought, appropriate humour and care. I do not think it's a perfect movie. But I think that it's miles and miles better than the fourth one and that it can without a problem stand shoulder to shoulder with the original trilogy. And even if you don't agree with me on this one, you have to agree it's better than the fourth one. And if it's better than a fourth one, it's at least a good enough movie to watch for fun, right?So, what are you waiting for?! Grab your mom, dad, brother, sister, grandpa, grandma, girlfriend, boyfriend, friend or anyone at all you connect this character with and go say goodbye both to legendary Harrison Ford and equally legendary archaeologist with fedora and a whip he portrayed, Dr. Henry Walton ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr.! 8/10! A warm recommendation!","

"MattWillow","14 July 2023","Went into this with pretty low expectations, which at least partly explains why I thought it was quite ok.Of course it had its share of problems. Started out with a digitally enhanced Indy taking on some nazis. Thought the cgi was pretty solid, although the lighting was deliberately low so it was harder to notice the flaws that were still there.The action scenes were fast paced in vintage Indiana Jones fashion. Harrison Ford weren't in most of them, which is understandable but still a shame. Speaking of Ford, at 80 he is still a forceful presence in every scene he's in. A true actor too rarely found these days.As fast paced as the action was, I still got the feeling I was watching a video game large portions of the film.Indys goddaughter sidekick was easily the worst thing about the entire movie. Totally annoying, none of the jokes landed and there was zero chemistry between her and Ford.Mads Mikkelsen was dependable as the adversary.It was good to see Jonathan Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen in a reunion of sorts. Still thought that the ending felt a bit cramped. Could have been done better, but this was ok. Maybe not price of admission ok, but a decent ride into the sunset.","

"ericgoldberg-50159","1 July 2023","This is a sequel that should have never been made. This is what Hollywood and especially Disney does. They make sequels just to make a quick buck and couldn't care less about good storytelling or even originality. Disney has sold out and now they've made Indiana Jones a sell out too. This movie is what an Indiana Jones movie should never be.... BORING. The only scene that really interested me is when Indy rides a horse through a 1960's subway. The plot is more worn out than Indy's hat. Harrison Ford said in interviews that this is officially the last one. If they do stupidly decide to make another one they can call it Indiana Jones and the Retirement Home.EDIT: The final scene is good but the build up to it is a complete letdown. This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst of all the Indiana Jones movies.","

There cannot be such bad management, I now believe that management is done with nepotism instead of merit.I gave the score entirely for the high visuals that money buys. The characters are cliche and mostly hollow. Finding logic in this scenario is harder than looking for a needle in a haystack. If you add a little more plot convenience to the scenario, there will be nothing else left in the movie. Instead of calling it a movie, we could even call it a two and a half hour meaningless action cg-fest. The bad guys of the movie are, of course, Nazis. Please come up with new, more creative historical villains now.Enough is enough, stop destroying all the intellectual value of the brands we love by spending millions of dollars.","

"amatullahdaya","5 July 2023","Watched this today and went in with some high hopes because Indiana jones were some of the best movies growing up. The theater wasnt very crowded but then again I guess not many of the younger generation know the movies or have even watched them.The opening was good but I could see where the anti-aging or de-aging process was used which made it difficult to unsee. It was a bit nostalgic in a way to see a ""young"" harrison playing Indi and chasing bad guy, impersonating bad guys and using his bag of tricks.The middle part of the plot is Indiana now older, a bit depressed and sad and the character of Helena, his god daughter is introduced. I do not like her character much and I do not think she was the best for the role.The climax was an okay ending. I expected some kind of twist and was hoping to see more of a younger Indiana Jones going back in time to live through some more adventures but since this is a farewell movie (I guess) it was an okay way to end.It was an average watch. Not the best from Indiana Jones but its watchable.","

"paul_haakonsen","29 August 2023","Having grown up watching, loving and enjoying the ""Indiana Jones"" movies ever since the first movie, I have to say that it was somewhat odd to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", knowing that it would be the last proper ""Indiana Jones"" movie with Harrison Ford in the iconic role. But it was a movie that had to be watched, of course, to round up the adventure that started back in 1981.The storyline in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", as written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and James Mangold, certainly looked and felt like a movie that belonged in the franchise. I found the storyline and script to be adequately entertaining and enjoyable, though it wasn't the best of storylines in the franchise. But it was entertaining for what it was. I think the script fitted nicely into the supernatural line of the previous four movies, so I had no problems with the time-travel aspect of the storyline.The acting performances in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" was good, and it was certainly nice to see Harrison Ford back in the role for one final adventure. And the moie also brought back Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies to reprise the roles of Marion and Sallah. In addition, then the movie brought new talents to the franchise, with the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Toby Jones and Antonio Banderas, so there certainly was some familiar faces and talented actors and actresses on the cast list.Visually then ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" was good. The special effects were good. However, there were some dubious moments when Harrison Ford was on the horse, where you could see it was a different actor, and also some moments when you could see that it was blatantly a CGI rendering of Harrison Ford's face, because it looked rather rigid and fake. And then there was the whole issue of making Harrison Ford younger by the use of CGI for the part of the movie that took place back in the 1940s. I can't claim that I am by any means a fan of that kind of usage of de-aging for actors and actresses, nor of fully CGI animating dead actors and actresses for movies. But of course that is a matter of personal preference.I was genuinely entertained by director James Mangold's 2023 movie ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", despite it being the final movie for Harrison Ford. So was it a movie that saw Indiana Jones off the screen in a fulfilling manner? I hardly think so, because I was left with a sense of 'but it wasn't really a proper way to say good bye to this iconic movie character'. But the movie was entertaining nonetheless.My rating of ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" lands on a seven out of ten stars. I could and would have wished for a more meaningful good bye to Dr. Jones, but it was what it was.","

"Horror_Flick_Fanatic","6 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones film series. The film stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, who races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history. Accompanied by his goddaughter, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA.The film has a number of problems, but the biggest one is the time travel narrative. It just doesn't fit with the Indiana Jones universe. The Indiana Jones films are all about historical adventure, and time travel is a very different genre. It feels like the filmmakers were trying to be too clever, and it ultimately undermines the film.Another problem with the film is that the Nazi narrative is getting old. We've seen Indiana Jones fight Nazis in three of the previous films, and it's starting to feel repetitive. It would have been more compelling if Indiana had done a completely new adventure in the 1960s, instead of repeating the same Nazi narrative of world conquest.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a disappointing film. It has some good action sequences, but the time travel narrative and the Nazi narrative hold it back. I would not recommend this film to fans of the Indiana Jones series.Here are some specific examples of how the time travel narrative and the Nazi narrative undermine the film:The time travel narrative breaks the rules of the Indiana Jones universe. In previous films, Indiana has always been a man of his time. He's used his knowledge of history to solve puzzles and defeat his enemies. But in this film, he's able to travel through time and change the course of history. This is a major departure from the established rules of the series, and it doesn't make sense.The Nazi narrative is getting old. We've seen Indiana Jones fight Nazis in three of the previous films. It's starting to feel like the filmmakers are running out of ideas. In this film, the Nazis are trying to use the Dial of Destiny to conquer the world. This is the same basic plot as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It's not very original.I would have liked to see Indiana Jones do a completely new adventure in the 1960s. This would have given the filmmakers a chance to do something different. They could have explored the Cold War, or they could have had Indiana face off against a new enemy. It would have been a fresh start for the series.Unfortunately, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a missed opportunity. It's a disappointing film that doesn't live up to the standards of the Indiana Jones series.","

I don't see how they can't figure it out. It seems to be a trend with Disney now. They keep pushing out tons of movies and the special effects continue to get worse. The storyline was lacking and it was entirely too long. This wasn't the Indiana Jones we all loved. I used to think Crystal Skull was the worst Indy movie but now I'm leaning towards this one. The last Indiana Jones in my book is The Last Crusade. You can't go wrong with Sean Connery as his dad. That's how I will remember Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.","

"spencer-w-hensley","10 July 2023","Although I had many reservations about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as many Indy fans did, I have rewatched it twice since it came out for the first time 15 years ago and thought I would never say this but I like that film better than this one.The ending was horrible and it's obvious Spielberg was trying to recapture the nostalgic feel of his previous movies Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. T. and blend them into the Indy franchise but aside from the awful ending beforehand it wasn't so bad.Spielberg had a good sense of pacing and it was never boring, even the end. It was stupid to be sure but not dull.Well just when you thought Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford were going to hang up Indy's whip for good 15 years ago apparently since Lucas sold his company to Disney they didn't feel that was enough and audiences wanted more Indy so here we have number 5.Spielberg was on board initially as was Lucas but both decided to only produce and hand over creative control to different writers and director James Mangold.At first I thought it could be better. I mean after all Spielberg and Lucas were both responsible for how ridiculous Crystal Skull was but seeing how number 5 turned out I now wish they had stayed on board.James Mangold may be a good director but he's no Spielberg and doesn't have his sense of wonder and adequate pacing that Spielberg and Lucas brought in one way or another to the first four films.To be sure there is some good stuff here. Even at 80 years old Harrison still plays an effective Indy. The actual story is clever and I like what they did with it and the ending is great and ought to satisfy any Indy fan.Yet even number 4 was better so the question is where did it all go wrong?I blame it on Disney for wanting to keep money grabbing Lucas' previous properties with Star Wars and now Indy. I can understand if they wanted one more to satisfy fans who disliked Crystal Skull but the finale should have been much better than this.And while Spielberg might have thought he was doing the right thing passing the directorial touch to Mangold, this franchise needs the Spielberg touch and magic that was in the other films and in many of his others.Mangold let's scenes go on way too long and up until about the last half hour it drags and drags and you keep thinking action will pick up and move along yet it doesn't.Spielberg and Lucas made Indiana Jones to be a non stop action franchise and when they were both in charge even if there wasn't action they had enough strong character development to not keep things boring.To differentiate himself from the original creators I think Mangold is trying to focus more on character development but unfortunately aside from the welcome return of Sallah and Marion the villains are not captivating enough nor are any of the other protagonists not something I can say about the previous four films.It's a nice effort but without Spielberg, Lucas, an effective screenplay and enough actions sequences with adequate pacing for me this goes down as the weakest of the franchise.It doesn't have enough compelling action or character chemistry as the others did.If you're a die hard Indy fan who can't miss this in theaters go for it, I guess some of it does work.But die hard Indy fan or not, I think you will get more enjoyment out of streaming this on Disney Plus in a few months.I think it's time Indy hangs up his whip and we give him a break. His first four adventures had enough excitement to offer this has very little in comparison.I know Ford obviously won't do anymore Indy flicks but if Disney is going to continue to do anything else with this franchise they have got to bring something fresher and more exciting to the table.","

"GrigoryGirl","5 July 2023","This is a deliberate, disgusting destruction of a franchise for political purposes, and it has permanently tainted everyone who was responsible for this atrocity, Bob Iger (the guy who runs Disney) and Kathleen Kennedy, the woman who has overseen the destruction of Willow, Star Wars, and now Indiana Jones, all with the blessing and cheering on from Bob Iger. The film essentially emasculates Indiana Jones, mocking him for being an old man, sadistically so, then his snarky goddaughter comes in and saves the day because she's perfect in everything she does and has never messed up in her life. I guess we should be grateful that the original version of this film never saw the light of day. Reportedly, the original cut had Indy killed off in the past, and Phoebe Waller Bridge (the most overhyped person in Hollywood history at this point) replaced Indy and took over the character permanently. After Lucasfilm showed this version to five different audiences (and who all hated it), they had to reshoot it. And let us not forget James Mangold, who, up to this point, was a respected director who has made some good films. He isn't respected as much as he once was, and his going on Twitter to trash fans and deny the rumors of reshoots (which turned out to be true) made him look petty and childish, and his reputation has taken a huge hit. He is tainted as well for directing this awful, nasty, soulless, sadistic film. This is one of the worst films in Disney history.","

"PeteThePrimate","3 July 2023","For me, this film ranks on a par with the Holy Grail with ROTLA being my favourite. Kate Crapshaw ruined the Temple of Doom and the less said about the Crystal Skull the better. Upon reflection, this film is more about Jones than the actual dial. His longing for the days of adventure and his obvious dislike of his current lot as a lecturer no-one really listens to. The opening 20 minutes or so are well done, good use of CGI etc and the main film moves along at a decent pace. One small criticism is that the film lacks the humour of the first 3 and there was less verbal sparring between Ford and Waller-Bridge, probably because of his dislike of the way she earns a living. I thought the Director did a decent job and after the last 2 films I didn't miss Spielberg's direction. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I hope this is the last one and that the studio allow the franchise to pass into history gracefully without any other prequels or sequels.","

"brentsbulletinboard","3 July 2023","It seems these days that it's become all too easy to blast popular, commercial fare simply because it is popular, commercial fare. Granted, some offerings of this type genuinely deserve whatever grief they get, but others, such as the latest installment in this long-running franchise, don't merit unfair potshots fired at them just for innately being mainstream offerings. In many ways, this is very much cut from the same cloth as its action adventure predecessors, but there are enough distinctions, new developments and lesser-known elements to keep it fresh and interesting throughout. Now, this is not to suggest that this final entry in this action adventure series is without its faults - it's overlong, some of its action sequences could have been easily pared back (despite generally being as good as they are) and the storyline tends to sag somewhat in the middle. However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve. So, to all those cynics out there who are shamelessly bashing this release to be fashionable or hip, all I can say is ""pipe down and lose the attitude already.""","

"chadk-45495","30 June 2023","I'm at a loss. I thought Indiana Jones was about an adventuring archeologist hunting ancient religious artifacts to be preserved in museums. And the first 20 minutes confirm that sentiment.And to be fair, John Williams' fantastic score reminds me that I did walk into the right showing. But instead of a rousing epic, I witnessed a strange concoction of overblown ideas, baffling casting choices, plot conveniences, bad dialogue, and some of the worst written characters I can remember. Especially Helena, who's played by a talented PWB but is written to be an insufferable, pedantic braggart.There's a strange veneer that makes everything resemble something familiar. But it all feels off. Even the deepfakery produced some chuckles in the theatre.There's some fun scenes and cameos and I enjoyed the villain. But calling this an Indiana Jones movie? Maybe Illinois Jones.","

"amesmonde","30 June 2023","Indiana Jones and his estranged goddaughter, Helena Shaw, try to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can alter the outcome of World War II.James Mangold steps into some big shoes and delivers a poignant Indiana Jones journey set primarily in 1969. The set-ups never quite match the film's 1944 opening with its exhilarating set-pieces, but the stunts and staging remain engaging throughout notably the parade chase and under water search. The banter between characters, written by a handful of writers, is executed well. As well as chases, shootouts, fights and whip-action there's henchmen, drinking and supernatural high jinks, synonymous with the film adventures. The narrative welcomingly weaves in MacGuffins and supernatural elements like its predecessors, even if dropping a very lengthy mystical, fantasy based closing act.Dial of Destiny offers an emotional journey for Indiana Jones, and its poignant moments add depth and meaning to Harrison Ford's beloved character Henry Jones Jr. These character-driven elements contribute to the film's dramatic impact. The supporting cast, while many of the characters feel like extended cameos, are on form. Antonio Banderas leaves his trademark charm and intensity, and both John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen lend weight to the overall narrative. Toby Jones is likable, and Boyd Holbrook leaves an impression, along with Mads Mikkelsen, who adds screen presence with a sense of intrigue and depth.While Dial of Destiny successfully delivers an entertaining adventure, it falls short in fully capitalizing on the nostalgia factor. There are missed opportunities to acknowledge or mention beloved characters like Short Round, Willie Scott, and Wu Han. Or draw dialogue comparisons of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Shaw to Marion Ravenwood, or Ethann Isidore's Teddy Kumar character to Short Round. It lacks the same immersive quality found in the earlier Indiana Jones movies, and hazy background and lighting/CGI effects, like in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's ending, are distractingly littered throughout. It maybe too late, unless Indiana is recast like James Bond or the technology is perfected, you can't help feel we need more live action adventures set in the late 1920s or 1930s.Despite these minor setbacks, Dial of Destiny remains a captivating adventure that showcases Harrison Ford's enduring portrayal of Indiana Jones, even if the tone is in the first two acts is quite grounded. That said, both Steven Spielberg, Philip Kaufman and George Lucas Indy DNA is present, cemented by John Williams fantastic score.Overall, Mangold's Dial of Destiny may not entirely capture the nostalgic magic of the first three, but it stands on its own as a commendable emotional addition to the beloved franchise.","

"cherold","20 September 2023","Director James Mangold made the gutsy decision to go head to head with Raiders of the Lost Arc in the first sequence, where a de-aged Harrison Ford (great tech!) gets an old-fashioned chase scene. And right away, it's clear this is not a Spielberg film. It's less that the action is a little muddled than that there's nothing memorable. Even the best bit with the big gun doesn't dazzle the way it should.Spielberg, even now, even in his weakest movies, always has something that makes you sit up and take notice. Had he directed this, there would have been a moment where you said, cool!Flash-forward to an aging Indiana Jones getting annoyed at his hippie neighbors, retiring from teaching, and encountering Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Helena, ready to drag him back into adventure.The premise is fine and there's a good deal of good-enough action and adventure involving Nazis and the central, sci-fi themed McGuffin, the Dial of Destiny. But the most notable moment in any of it is a brief callback to the original movie.The movie also tends to skitter over its ideas instead of diving in. Indie is old, but he still does all sorts of young-person action things. The CIA does awful things but it's just a plot device. This movie never wants you to think it might actually be *about* something.Still, it's all decent enough until we finally learn the Nazi plan for the Dial of Destiny, which is *remarkably* idiotic. Not only that, but every advantage the Nazis could use to pursue this plan - they do the opposite. And the sci-fi concept is absurd on multiple levels, like something out of Axe Cop. It's hard to explain how stupid it is without diving into spoilers, so I won't, but OMG.The funny thing is, I don't consider this the worst Indy movie. That would be Temple of Doom. But for all its flaws, the first two scenes of Temple of Doom were brilliant and the mine cart scene was really good. Dial of Destiny doesn't have anything as terrible as the worst of Temple of Doom (except the Nazi plan, which is mind-boggling but also a small part of the film), but it doesn't have anything as glorious as diamonds and ice skittering across the floor.When Spielberg decided he didn't want to direct this they should have pulled the plug. This is perfectly watchable, but it's no more than that, and wasn't blowing the dust off Indy to take him out for one last spin.I don't recommend watching this, although honestly if you're a fan of the series you'll probably do what I did and ignore the bad reviews and watch it anyway. Just don't say you weren't warned.","

"spotboyfilms","7 July 2023","I really enjoyed Dial of Destiny. James Mangold is an exciting filmmaker because he is able to combine the tastes of a new millenia with the filmmaking aesthetics of greats like Spielberg and the bunch.The movie has excellent De-Aging effects. The Uncanny Valley Curve has been crossed and the de-aging doesn't look weird anymore. There are a couple of noticeable flaws still, but overall it was very impressive.The movie moves fast and checks off a lot of stylistic elements from the original trilogy. James Mangold is excellent at keeping a balance between keeping the mood of the original trilogy without making it a scene for scene ripoff. The newer characters are overall good- just falling short of charismatic- but good enough to warrant a good time with them. I like that the film doesn't refrain from fatally harming a few characters- because it keeps the stakes real and high. I hate it when in modern movies no one gets hurt- and so there are no real stakes. So, Dial of Destiny definitely delivers on the hurt.After the massive disaster that was Crystal Skull, Dial of Destiny is refreshing. The climactic battle I thought was the best part of the movie. It felt fitting for the character and I wish they had made more of a moment out of it.This movie was a lot of fun. Drags at some of the action-less scenes but not too much. I'm not sure why people are disliking it. For me its a 8/10 Minus 1 point for a Long Runtime. Make your movies 2 hrs or less guys if you want that extra point. Cheers.","

"cliftonofun","10 July 2023","They managed to land the plane, literally and figuratively. While the last Indiana Jones movie left a bad taste in my mouth, this one offered a satisfying final chapter. Ridiculousness is baked into these types of adventure tales, but that ridiculousness should enhance rather than dampen the story. Dial of Destiny rides that line. The first half or so just flew by - great action storytelling that left me cackling with delight. The second half got a bit bogged down, but still managed to inch across the finish line. It is fitting that this last Indiana Jones story would be not only an epic quest, but a reflection on what it means to grow older and figure out our next/final chapters.","

I really liked the character that Phoebe Waller-Bridge played she was a perfect antagonist. Her character was a little see through but played very well. The effects throughout the movie and of course as usual the places shown were interesting. I did not care for the underwater scenes as for me they were a little dark. Bottom line is that it is an enjoyable movie just go in and be ready to watch and consider it a movie for the brain dead.","

"moviesmoviesmovies","6 September 2023","I went into seeing Indiana Jones with the lowest expectations and darkest perception of what's to come (based on many reviews), but I had a great time and was entertained, thoroughly, for over 2 hours.There are some issues with the film, but if you like Indy, time travel, killing Nazis, and want some closure to this saga, this film is it. There's even redemption for the main characters who learn a thing or two about life.What I did not like is the poor quality CGI of NYC, particularly the parade sequence. Broadway, where the parade actually took place, is quite large. This film's version looks like a small Brooklyn street.There are a couple of other issues - if Indy is being sought after by the police and all the law enforcement people of NYC, why is his name screamed out at the airport for all to hear? And how does he even get near a plane, let alone get on one?All that aside, I enjoyed this film. I found the ending fitting and satisfying.","

The first movie was made back in 1981 so I can understand Harrison getting tired of playing the same character for 42 years. Anyway, this is a nice send off. Plot wise, there is an artifact everyone wants, in this case, it starts off in WW2 where Harrison-digitally de_aged-and Toby appropriate a magical dial from Mads and his Nazi brothers. The dial-which can literally change history-was made by Archimedes, who broke it into 2 pieces so the bad guys would have to work harder to find it-it was also hidden in different locations. Jump to the present and Phoebe-Toby's daughter-shows up to see if she can get Harrison to help her find both pieces. That's when Mads pops back up too and the fun begins with archaeologists versus Nazis in lots of chases and fights. There are a few cameos that pop up too-I remember seeing John Rhys_Davies, Antonio Banderas and Karen Allen.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 34 minutes.If you are a fan, you should enjoy it-I did-and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

"Luv2Spooge","4 November 2023","I was put off by the bad reviews, which many were politically motivated especially with what Disney has been doing with their live action remakes. However, after watching it on the plane, I thought it is a pretty good film.In a nutshell, what we have here is a clean family fun film. There is no political overtone, no activists, no ""the message,"" but just good old fashion Indiana Jones.Though some complained about the female Mutt William replacement, but I thought her character was well balanced. I wouldn't even say she's a female Indiana. Her character is a combination of a lot of previous characters. She acts like Mutt, but is an archaeologist like Dr. Elsa Schiender. She has a little of Ravenwood's wildness in her too.I also think the film did a great job on Indiana. Even at his age, he was not written off as weak and helpless like Luke Skywalker or even Captain Picard. He is still action packed, but realistic in many regards. Some may noticed, he didn't fight the ""big"" bad guy as in all previous films.The weakness of the film lies in the script. At 5th installment, it has lost its luster and a lot of it is recycled and cliche. They try to compensate that with a lot of action sequences, but they failed to deliver. It was ""ok"" but none of the chase scenes or fight scenes were anywhere on par with like Mission Impossible or even Jurassic World's city chase scenes.A bit part of that is due to Disney and the film does seem to be more kid friendly and lost that ""serious"" tone. What this does is that it makes it look like the protagonist is a superhero, thus takes away the excitement of actions scenes because you know he was never really in any actual danger.But as I've said in the beginning, it is a solid family friendly movie and it has its moments. I especially like the ending, the Siege of Syracuse was amazingly done.","

"jonathan-972-150139","30 June 2023","People come to review threads to get some semblance of an idea of public sentiment. That includes negative & positive takes. You either like something, dislike it, or feel ambivalent towards it. People are allowed to have those sentiments. No matter what the paid contributors might have to say on the matter. And if they are disregarded in the forums by having their opinions blacklisted, believe me, they will vote with their wallets.My personal take on this movie is that it was indeed completely unnecessary. It doesn't feel glued to anything else canonical. Indy is a miserable shell of his former self. It has been made crystal clear by the creators that some of the casting decisions are there strictly for the purposes of agenda. But the biggest crime IMO is that it simply isn't good.PWB is shoehorned in there to add dimensions of a character without any depth. She's not funny enough to be comical. She's not attractive enough to be appealing. And don't get me started on her pithy diatribe about capitalism. There's nothing more that I want to see than a bunch of elitist actors funded by one of the most monolithic corporations on the planet lecture me about the evils of a capitalist society.Bottom line: If you like it, it's your business.

"burlesonjesse5","2 July 2023","Let's get this right out of the way shall we, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fourth best entry in the franchise's 42-year canon. That basically means it's better than ""Crystal Skull"" (basically). ""Dial's"" running time is almost two and a half hours but it doesn't feel like it. And there's plenty of loud, bone-crunching stuff even though you can't fully see who's shooting and/or punching who.Now am I going to recommend Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny? I am but for reasons other than that rip-roaring, caper medium. Yup, ""Dial"" feels just like an Indiana Jones pic until it well, doesn't. The incorporation of time travel and everyone's favorite archaeologist, yeah I can dig it.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes place in 1969 with an opening flashback via World War II. James Mangold takes over the reins as director from Steven Spielberg. Yeah I'm not going to lie, Mangold is a solid storyteller and the way ""Dial"" unfolds in its last act is truly awesome and invigorating. As for the look of the film, well it too is solid, all glistening and shiny and CGI'd to the hilt.What Mangold lacks however, is Spielberg's aptness for staging action sequences, you know the attention to detail, the editing, the spine-chilling progression (revert back to first paragraph). Heck, ""Dial"" isn't really action adventure, it's more like a revealing family dramatization coupled with elongated chase concatenations. It's as if James Mangold couldn't let Ford v Ferrari go.Oh well. ""Dial"" is overall, fast-faced and mostly entertaining (if you can suspend a little aerodynamic disbelief). ""Raiders"" had the ark, ""Temple of Doom"" had the stones, ""Last Crusade"" had the Holy Grail, and ""Crystal Skull"" had the gulp, alien skull (ugh). Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has the pursuit of an Archimedes Dial (there's always a pursuit).With star Harrison Ford at an all-time curmudgeon level (what'd you expect, he's 80) and co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge dutifully on board (she plays goddaughter Helena Shaw), ""Dial"" is a summer movie that's an open mind alternative to DC and Marvel fodder (that would be Spidey and the Flash). Manifest ""destiny"".","

"Darksidecrew","30 June 2023","We are back for the fifth and most likely final Indiana Jones film. I will say off the bat that I do not agree with any of the early negative buzz.The film starts in the mid 1940s with the de-aged Harrison Ford. This portion of the film was much longer than expected as I expected it to be a minor flashback but it's quite a lengthy entree. The de-aging is good but not as good as the still pictures would have you believe. It suffers with certain movements and in certain lighting. That said, some sections look phenomenal. However it is the current day Harrison Ford voice coming out of the young Indiana Jones face and he walks like an old Harrison from time to time too. However I really enjoyed it and got caught up in it that I think I could easily take a whole film of it.Then the film shifts to current day Indiana Jones in 1969 and looks gorgeous. Some people were critical of Mangolds direction but I think he did a great job. The acting is great also except the child actor who I thought was subpar.The third act may be too much for some people but in context of the series it is less over the top than crystal skull and a bit more out there than the original trilogy endings. It was a great rousing adventure and kept the tradition going of the odd numbered Indiana Jones films being the good ones and that the nazi villains being in the good ones also.","

"MrDHWong","29 June 2023","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is the fifth entry in the ""Indiana Jones"" film series. Directed and co-written by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"", ""Logan"", ""Ford v Ferrari"") and starring Harrison Ford in the lead role, it proves that the quality of a belated sequel can only be as good as the age of its protagonist and the strength of its characterisation.In 1969, Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford) retires from his job as an archaeology teacher at his local university in New York. As he drowns his sorrows away in a bar, Jones encounters Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), his estranged goddaughter and the daughter of one of his late archaeologist friends. Picking up where her father left off, Shaw has been hunting for the ""Dial of Destiny"", a powerful ancient artefact capable of causing rifts in time, and asks for Jones's help in tracking down its three missing pieces. After the pair discover the location of one of the parts, they are attacked by former Nazi agent Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who has his own plans for the Dial of Destiny and its world-changing abilities. Voller and his henchmen quickly pursue the pair across various countries, stopping at nothing until he has all three pieces in his possession.Ever since the release of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" over 40 years ago, the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise has remained one of the most beloved adventure series in the history of pop culture. The titular hero, recognisable by his trademark fedora, leather jacket, whip, dry sense of humour, and extensive knowledge of archaeology, is one of two signature roles played by Harrison Ford (the other being Han Solo in the ""Star Wars"" films). Over these past four decades, there have been four films made featuring the character, with the general consensus being that the first three are the best and the fourth, 2008's ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", still evoking sharply divided opinions among fans and critics even to this day. Fifteen years and a Disney buyout later, we now have a fifth entry in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", a supposedly final addition to the film series that capitalises on as much nostalgia as possible while unfortunately losing sight of what made all these films so special in the first place.The character of Indiana Jones (Indy) has always been intended to embody the archetype of the masculine, strong-willed heroes you would read about in the pulp adventure novels of several decades past. Jones is not only proficient in physical combat and weaponry, but he is also quick-witted and highly intelligent, though he is certainly not immune to human error. To that effect, he is the type of hero that many men strive to be like and many women desire to be with. Like ""Crystal Skull"" before it, ""Dial of Destiny"" has made the mistake of assuming the audience wishes to see Indiana Jones as an old man incapable of performing some of his best feats without any kind of assistance.When we are first introduced to Indy in this film, it is through a flashback scene showcasing what he is most well known for - fighting off bad guys who are after a priceless artefact. Shortly thereafter, the film flashes forward to the late 1960s where we see an elderly Indy complaining to his young neighbours about their loud music. Though this scene is meant to be played for laughs, I just couldn't help but feel sad instead at seeing this once legendary action hero reduced to a cranky ""get off my lawn"" old man who isn't taken seriously by the youth of that era. This is a far cry from the Indy we once knew and loved, who used to revel in the playful nature of an adventure and would always find a way to cleverly correct a situation rather than simply whine about it. If this were the only instance where Indy's age was called into question, I could maybe let it slide but to my annoyance it becomes practically the entire backbone of his character from start to finish.Another thing that the ""Indiana Jones"" films are known for are their exciting action scenes, usually involving a vehicle with the backdrop of an exotic location. This tradition continues here as we are treated to some fast-paced car chases, fist fights, and the odd shootout in places such as Morocco and Greece. Taking over directorial duties from Steven Spielberg, James Mangold proves he was the right choice as he manages to hold the audience's attention during these scenes with his clever editing techniques, which adds some important tension whenever necessary. My favourite action sequence was probably the one at the beginning, which takes place on a train as previously mentioned. There are a few fun call-backs to the previous films sprinkled in which I won't spoil, but the reason I liked it the most was because it featured a younger Indy as opposed to a decrepit old man. Every other moment of action looked awkward in comparison, as we are forced to watch an old Indy constantly try to keep up with enemies bombarding him with a barrage of bullets and punches.Taking into account his advanced age, I have to give credit to Harrison Ford for trying his best to hold up alongside his considerably younger cast members. Based on nostalgia alone, his final reprisal of one of his most iconic characters is enough to stir up feelings of sadness in longtime Indiana Jones fans such as myself. This is a character Ford clearly has a personal attachment to, which makes sense when you remember his enduring popularity after all these years. Yet despite all that, the octogenarian actor just doesn't seem like he is a natural fit for this type of action any more. There are parts where Indy looks exhausted from just throwing a single punch and one scene in particular required him to ask his partner Helena to help him move a relatively small stone into place. The younger Indy would have had no trouble with any of this in the past so seeing the geriatric version struggle to pull off even the most basic of tasks comes across as rather disheartening, though perhaps not in the way the filmmakers intended.I also didn't particularly care for the way Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character Helena was handled in the film. What I assume was supposed to be a younger, more energetic partner for Indy to play off is instead a condescending and smug accomplice who insists on being right all the time. The whole way through it just felt like Helena is only helping Indy solely out of obligation rather than because she truly cares about him, like the way one would assist a random old person crossing the street simply as a sense of public duty. Often whenever Indy is unable to maintain the pace of what is happening around him, Helena will make a point of berating him for his age and that he is ""stuck in another era"". I can't tell if these parts are meant to be funny or if we're supposed to assume she is only teasing but it makes her character seem rude and unlikeable. Normally I'm all for sassy female companions to male heroes, but if her only gimmick is to insult him and always rub his flaws in his face then I quickly start to lose interest in these types of characters.It seems like a natural fit for Mads Mikkelsen to play an ""Indiana Jones"" villain, but for the most part his character doesn't work as well as he should. Voller is somewhat similar to Colonel Dietrich from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", in that he is a high ranking Nazi officer hunting down an artefact that can change the world. Of course, Mikkelsen excels at playing sinister European-accented villains, yet this film doesn't really give him enough memorable material to work with. The problem here is that we don't properly learn the reason why he actually wants the artefact so badly until far too late into the story. By the time we are told what he intends to do with it, the film is almost over. This is the type of villain who needs to make his end goal clear earlier in the film rather than later, because most of the time I just didn't feel any tension when he was pursuing Indy and co. You could argue that Voller being a Nazi is good enough reason to want to stop him, and while that is true, I still think the film could have done a better job fleshing out his character and motivations beyond that.As a purported conclusion to the series, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" ends things not with a bang but with a quiet fizzle. While it doesn't reach the levels of ridiculousness as nuking a fridge or shoehorning in aliens where they don't belong, the film nonetheless fails to reach the heights of its first three classic entries, which to be fair, is a very tall order. Regardless, there are still some fleeting moments of entertainment that should keep most audiences satisfied. As for me, I'm one of those people who thinks the series should have ended at ""Last Crusade"", with everything else following being nothing more than an unnecessary epilogue. However, given Disney's tendency to milk franchises for all they're worth, it is inevitable that there will probably be more ""Indiana Jones"" content coming whether we want it or not.I rate it 6/10.","

"smblights","1 July 2023","I read a couple of reviews, both good and bad before I went to see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and it's safe to say I was a little nervous walking in to the theater. Not only because of the mixed reviews but because it's another Indiana Jones and I didn't want the series, Ford's last one, to end in a flop with a worse result than the last one. Well I have no idea what it will make or if it will even touch close to its $294,000,000.00 budget but I was completely satisfied and actually thankful that they made it! It was all that I was hoping for, an INDIANA JONES MOVIE WITH ALL THE INDIANA JONES ELEMENTS THAT HAS KEPT ME ATTACHED SINCE I WAS A CHILD. I just do not understand that hate reviews- I think people were wanting something else altogether. Have people forget what an Indiana Jones movies was like? Action, story, adventure , good acting - ITS ALL THERE IN THIS NEW ONE- WITH FORD IN HIS 80's AND ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IT!!! If you are an Indiana Jones fan(truly) than you will enjoy this movie and be grateful that they made it and didn't retire Ford from the roll with 'The Crystal Skull'.Don't be scared about the bad reviews- Go have some fun!!!!!!!","

"southdavid","16 July 2023","Hitting a franchise again, 15 years after the last, unloved, film in it was released and 34 after the last good one, is a really tricky prospect. I didn't dislike ""Dial of Destiny"" but to say that it's the most expensive film in the franchise, it feels like the cheapest.Having come into contact with The Antikythera, Archimedies' legendary tool, at the end of the second World War, aging Professor, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is dragged into a quest to recover the other half of it by Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) the daughter of an old associate. Also after the device is Juergen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) a Nazi scientist who came to America as part of Operation Paperclip and is helping the US to win the space race. Jones quickly comes to learn that although Shaw is an archaeologist, her inspiration in chasing the dial is not altruistic.I do think, one thing that instantly worked against this film was the opening 25 minutes using the de-aging process on Ford for an action sequence in the closing moments of WW2. Despite the gargantuan amount of money they appear to have spent to achieve it, it's never that convincing and every time they gave us a close up, all I saw was the effect and it completely took me out of the film. Fortunately, that mostly goes away after we get to 1969 (apart from digital replacement of stuntmen, which again never worked). From there, the action scenes are OK, but they're a little below par relative to what you'd see in a ""John Wick"", or a ""Fast and Furious"" film.I liked Phoebe Waller-Bridge in this. She's definitely not the 'shrew' character that aspects of the internet feared she would be. Harrison Ford is great as always and is one of the last few true movie stars. I understand why Mikkelsen and the creative team moved away from screaming Nazi stereotype for the villain, but it does leave both him, and his team, as rather lifeless antagonists. Spoiler free, but I didn't mind the third act 'twist' I suppose. The principles at play are no less fantastical than 'magic god box' or 'Jesus cup'. The film though is surprisingly gore/horror free given how wild the franchise has been in the past.Overall, I'd describe the film as ""not bad"" rather than ""good"". Better than ""Crystal Skull"" but destined for a lot less cultural impact. A low-key end for an iconic character.","

Classic Indiana Jones, well-paced action with some slight outlandish fun...Then we fast forward and the real movie starts. This is where the movie drops from a 7/10 to a 1/10 very quickly,Indie is a shell of a character. Harrison is there only for the paycheque and it really shows. The writing of the character is lazy. A tired trope of a jaded once-hero turned-loser.Phoebe viscount the posh is just the absolute worst. Devoid of any charisma and reeking of arrogance in both the writing of the character and the actor's portrayal. Incredibly unlikeable.Then as the story develops you realise the plot is nonsense.

The story leaves a lot to be desired.An uncreative argument with many gaps, and a lot of fiction in a story that intends to be realistic.I liked the references to other Indy films, and the appearances (in a farewell tone) of other characters from this saga.Great acting from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and a surprising new actor Ethann Isidore. 👍

"Kassdhal","1 July 2023","Indiana Jones is one of the greatest characters in the history of cinema.IJ DoD is just a very sad way to part with this beloved icon.Five main issues here
1. Indiana Jokes has become an old and sad man that had lost the energy and optimism that he had in his entire life
2. The movie is clearly made to position Helena as the next generation but she lacks the gravitas, moral compass and character arc that would enable anything close to that
3. The villains are « meh » at best. How come you couldn't write something better for someone as talented as Mads Mikkelsen probably show the lack of drive in the writing room
4. The film is way too long. You could have cut 30min and still make it
5. Overall the film lacks charm and cohesiveness, the characters have no chemistry with each other, and it feels like a chore instead of a joy.Crystal Skull felt like an Indiana jones movie even if it was the weakest of the série. DoD is just very weak and a very sad departure of a beloved character.","

"snoozejonc","2 September 2023","Indy searches for the Archimedes Dial.Like all good Indiana Jones films it starts with a thrilling action sequence and I think this one is almost up there with the best.As the plot shifts in time it plausibly shows the titular character in a place he would likely be at the twilight of his years. It achieves this with mixture of poignant moments and a moving performance from Harrison Ford. I think scenes relating to these themes are the strongest aspect of the film.Ford's delivery of one speech that references his son and marriage is for me the outstanding piece of acting in the movie. Plus the contrasting scenes of Indy at the start and finish of the 60s period is very memorable and at some points emotional.First and foremost it is an action adventure driven by a traditional macguffin search. The nature of the artefact is clever from a thematic perspective, but the adventure itself is mostly forgettable. It allows producers to fill the action quotas, tick nostalgia boxes, and introduce new characters.I think when the artefact is finally used, there feels like a big rush to end the movie in a place where there could have been a more interesting adventure. I personally would have excised earlier scenes and characters to make room for this to be expanded upon. Did it need so many chases? Did it need the underwater scenes? Did it need a certain cameo? Did it need the teenage sidekick? For me this clutters up something that could potentially have been more interesting.My expectations were low going into it, but admit to being pleasantly surprised how well certain aspects are realised. However, I think any film featuring the famous whip and fedora will always be unfavourably compared to the original trilogy, unless it stands out from its contemporaries as they did. It begs the question, if you cannot do it to this standard, why do it at all? The answer to this is 'profit' and even though it doesn't sit quite right with me, at least it is better than 'The a kingdom of the Crystal Skull'.","

"arauzado","29 June 2023","The essential thing about this film is whether it would answer the questions that fans of this mythical saga wanted to know:
Is it better than the previous installment? Yes it isIs it worth going to see it in the cinema? Yes, its worth itBut if we analyze the film in more depth, it has numerous flaws, which cause the story to stumble: An excessively long prologue, where we are more concerned with believing the rejuvenated CGI face of the character than because of the script, and with a train that seems taken out of cartoons and that we never came to believe.Very well filmed persecutions, but that add unnecessary and forced elements: Why a jilted mafia lover in Morocco?New and old characters that do not contribute anything to the film: Sallah, or the character of Antonio Banderas. And worst of all: Not very well written characters, because they never arouse sympathy in the viewer: And I mean the character of Helena or Teddy, a poorly made copy of Marion and Short round.On the other hand, this film is far from the first trilogy because the total lack of that classic sense of humor that the master Spielberg did have: Each scene ending finished off with a good joke, each response full of wit from Indiana. Here is not in any scene like that.The only good joke in the whole movie is Youre German, dont try to be funny.In short: it's not a bad movie, but it could have been better.","

"akcenat","6 December 2023","Indiana Jones returns in ""Dial of Destiny,"" and while it's a nostalgic thrill to see Harrison Ford back in the fedora, the film feels stuck in the past. It's long, repetitive, and lacks the spark of its predecessors. The action sequences, though plentiful, are uninspired, the CGI occasionally jarring. While new faces like Phoebe Waller-Bridge inject fresh energy, the story itself feels derivative. Ultimately, ""Dial of Destiny"" is a decent throwback for die-hard fans, but it's more of a slow walk down memory lane than a thrilling new adventure.I'm a bit disappointed...Rating: 6.75 out of 10.","

"theffachrif","10 July 2023","Directed and co-written by James Mangold, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is set in 1969, the film follows Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw trying to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can take it for himself and change the outcome of World War II.If there's a word that I would use to sum up this movie is probably underwhelming. The movie starts with a much-hyped de-aged Harrison Ford fighting off a Nazi on a moving train to Berlin, the de-aging looked pretty good for the most part but it gets obvious and uncomfortable to look at when Indy gets into action. While director James Mangold tried his best to make the action as fun as the last four movies (yeah I enjoyed Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) but he's no Spielberg and it's nowhere near as memorable and impactful. Only the first 20 minutes or so truly felt like an Indiana Jones movie, the rest of it is just off, excessive, and dull at the same time even the score by John Williams couldn't really help it nonetheless, I quite enjoyed it. Seeing Mads Mikkelsen's name as the bad guy gets me excited and all but later disappointed by how they handled his character, so you can't put all the blame on his performance. He even got very little screen time to shine, looks like he appeared only when the time or situation is convenient for him, and he's just there. Thomas Kretschmann as a Nazi Colonel is more menacing, they probably should have just developed him as the villain instead I guess.So this is it right?, the last one for Indiana Jones, ever. Why not make him have an adventure with his actual family in his swan song, they instead write a new character that's basically his annoying goddaughter who always tries to get under his ""hat"" with her own Short Round wannabe. (Spoiler Alert!!) And turned him into a sad, broken old man by killing off his son and on the brink of a divorce. What could be a happier ending for his character than the one we already got in Crystal Skull though, it's a more fitting closure to me.Frankly, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is just another action blockbuster that happens to feature the iconic character who seems not enjoying what he should've in his final outing.6,5/10.","

"apereztenessa-1","2 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny achieves its goal: to make a true Indiana Jones movie. It is fun, full of action that doesn't feel pulled out of a PowerPoint, and with a story and characters that bring back the spirit of the original films without feeling formatted or repetitive. Not a small feat, and if you love Indiana Jones, I think you will like this installment.A number of critics have mentioned that the film highlights how Indiana Jones is out of his element in the sixties, and they center the film on that feeling. I disagree. While that context is surfaced in the beginning, it's there only to show more strongly how Indiana Jones as a character and hero is almost timeless and how as soon as he puts the hat on, the adventure is back as if time hadn't passed.This is truly the boldest bet of the film: it chooses to believe that an 80-year old Harrison Ford can play the physical action hero again. In that sense, Dial of Destiny is diametrically opposed to Logan (James Mangold's iconic take on a superhero movie) which explored how a superhero aged, and if anything, the film is closer to some Stallone movies such as Rocky V or Rambo, which put forward heroes that rejected their aging.So why this thematic change when Logan worked so well? Because Logan aged its actors, and Dial of Destiny started from an 80-year old Harrison Ford. Depicting the actors' old age, decrepitude, as he took on the role for the last time was not the goal, and would not have been respectful. Right after the initial de-aged scene, a shot shows the body of Harrison Ford coming out of bed, scarcely dressed. It's a shot that was not required, mind you, but that is there intentionally to show the reality of this man, a shot that is there to say to the audience: ""This is what this body is now. Do you want to revel in this sad reality for two hours, or are you willing to dream one last time, and believe this man can be the hero you love?""The choices in the rest of the film all flow from this initial decision. Everything is aimed at creating the illusion that this man can still be a hero in a somewhat credible way. Action scenes primarily in vehicles vs overly physical, dimly lit scenes so that aging is less visible. I believe the bet works, and it was not an easy one to pull off. In a different time, one could have imagined a younger actor reprising the role. I do believe that is possible and it will come, and I will confess I am eager to see a vigorous Indiana Jones on screen again. Until then, Dial of Destiny is a love letter to Harrison Ford and the Indiana Jones that he was, and who filled our dreams as children. And it is a highly enjoyable ride.","

This is anything but.Indy, beside the a short prologue where they used CGI to de-age him, is a sad old man who down for the count and although you think this movie is about revitalizing him to his old self but it is not. It is yet another Kathleen Kennedy trademarked plot of replacing a white hero by a (white) women who is so dislikeable that it is hard to feel anything good about her.The plot is convoluted and in disarray which makes me think it went back and forth in the cutting room and I could not care less where it went and just wanted to leave the cinema.

"indiana1981","24 December 2023","Just watched this movie a few months after it came out. I saw the reviews were mixed, which is why I put it off, but honestly, I don't know why people were disappointed...As an Indie fan, I have high expectations and this movie does please in all areas. Firstly, I am happy this movie retains the darker vibe we feel in ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" - (I know some people didn't like this?). I also like the Nazi theme. And given Indie's age, he does not overly exert himself, his character is realistic for his age.I think Phoebe Waller Bridge is a nice addition to the franchise too. (I would have liked to have actually seen more dry British humour, but maybe this was toned down for an international audience).I was worried the story around the artefact they were chasing, would at some point unravel into a mess, (like the last movie), but it didn't. And I have to say the ending made me smile, it was cute and I loved seeing Indie end his stint embracing with Marion.I guess ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" holds so much nostalgia for me, but I enjoyed the small sprinkles I saw in the movie.The only thing noticeable, is that Steven Spielberg didn't produce this movie. But all in all, I'm happy Harrison's final movie was produced at a good standard, it's entertaining, has a good storyline and keeps you interested.Definitely worth watching.","

"Mr-Fusion","6 July 2023","It's fine. I guess.All throughout ""Dial of Destiny"", there were two biases I couldn't shake. One was the age factor that was so stressed back in ""Crystal Skull"", (the passage of time, dearly departed friends and overall aging). That was fifteen years ago(!), and here we are again because Iger wants to cash in on another IP. That's the other problem I had: why are we here? That's really the movie's overall burden.It's not a bad film, it's just *there*; it ticks off boxes with a very long running time and an insufferable Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Dial"" occupies that middle ground between ""Raiders"" and ""Crystal Skull"": safe and boring.Kudos to Ford for proving himself yet again and I appreciate the desire to give his favorite character a proper send-off. But this is a clear-cut example of a studio refusing to leave well enough alone.The perfect ride into the sunset happened two movies ago.","

"WhiteRau","4 January 2024","Good to see Jones back in the saddle. Pacing was a tad drawn out, making the sequences feel a unnecessarily tedious. The writers obviously didn't know how to write a building historical interest into the show, so it fell back to overly long 'action' scenes without meaningful ties to the point of it all along the way. The new female co-star is not very appealing to either look at or listen to. They tried to hard to make her 'edgy' and she wound up just a straight-up, plain b*tch. Worth a watch on your platform of choice despite it all because the show winda out to a pretty good ending, for which a grudging nod can be given.","

At some point, I wondered do I watch ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" - it was cunningly (of course) solving some hidden riddles which is kind of stupid and cliche. And in the end, the smart nazi scientist got the data wrong, but a History teacher and a thief got it right - come on! Plus, this entire nazi story is another cliche by itself - try some other villains.It is a watchable movie, kind of keeps a dose of the Indiana Jones spirit, but is nothing close to the old movies mostly because it's a modern Hollywood interpretation. The usual adventure movies with Dwayne Jonson are more exciting, at least are more creative.","

I felt that the sound mix was badly balanced with the dialogue far too quiet and the music too loud, so I found the dialogue hard to follow. I saw Antonio Banderas on the credits, but didn't even notice him in the film, so whatever scene(s) he had were just not memorable. I didn't like the thieving goddaughter character, her ""jokes"" were not funny, and her short round replacement was contrived, and didn't have the same charm that the original had.

So many things happen that force you to disavow all common sense and logic, it becomes laughable at times. The first half was a little boring, and the second half was a little silly.

"thomasbungay-80306","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a great conclusion to the franchise. The director, James Mangold does a similar job to what he did with 'Logan' and does a fantastic job concluding an old man Indy on his final adventure. Surprisingly, Phoebe Waller Bridge was a highlight of this movie and a great inclusion along with Ethan Isidore who plays 'Teddy' a young character much like Short Round. They keep the franchises tung and cheek comedy going throughout and Mads Mikkelson does a great job as the antagonist. The story is actually really solid with the time travel element keeping you on you're toes throughout. Harrison Ford obviously is fantastic once again as Indiana Jones and does a great job performing an older and more run down interpretation of our favourite archaeologist. As an action and adventure movie on its own it's consistent and fun throughout however you can't help but feel it's missing a little bit of that Indy charm that Steven Spielberg brought to the franchise. Of course it's not as good as any of the original three films, but other than that, it's a really enjoyable film and a great end to one of my favourite movie franchises of all time!","

"Holt344","6 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final film in the franchise, also the first which is not directed by Steven Spielberg nor written by George Lucas. It's instead directed by James Mangold but if I remember correctly I read how Spielberg was there to help give his thoughts. Mangold co-wrote it with Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp. The latter of them wrote the screenplay for the previous film in the franchise. The film stars Harrison Ford, John Rhys-Davies, and Karen Allen reprising their roles as Indiana Jones, Sallah, and Marion Ravenwood, respectively, from earlier films. New cast members include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook and Ethann Isidore.Set in 1969, the film follows Indiana Jones and his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw trying to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can take it for himself and change the outcome of World War II.Fifteen years ago, I'm fairly certain my father took me to see Kingdom of the Crystal Skull after having shown me the other ones, which made me fall in love with the character of Indiana Jones and the adventures plus the mythology around the archeological finds. Steven Spielberg directed every installment and was close to direct this one before deciding not to, James Mangold was a great replacement and possibly the best person for the job which he shows in almost every scene, it's the writing that drags the film down though. I miss Steven Spielberg though, he's important for the franchise, as important as writer/producer George Lucas. What I think many including myself thought is how would this film turn out with a new creative team under Disney and Kathleen Kennedy, it ended up being a satisfying conclusion to Indiana Jones and a good adventure film. What each film had, including what was the worse one ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", was great action sequences and sadly this new film doesn't have many good nor memorable action sequences. There was one which was great and memorable, and it was the last action sequence, which will become iconic I'm sure.Regarding the writing, there actually was character development for Helena Shaw which I didn't think there would be, the dialogue was bad for her though. I liked the character development for Harrison Ford, though the characterization in the beginning was a bit off. It's thanks to the themes which made his arc so great. Overall though, the writing was actually quite okay! I really liked the story, the characters and especially the antagonist. Mads Mikkelsen along with Harrison Ford had the best performances, Helena Shaw's friend Teddy Kumar became extremely unnecessary in the second and third act, having so much plot armor and being perfect in everything left a sour taste for me. I liked the characters of Basil Shaw and Renaldo. One important character that's missing is Mutt, killing off Mutt/Henry Jones the third off screen is something I'll always ask myself, yes Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't the best Jones film but Mutt was not what was wrong with the film. I dislike how Disney or Kathleen Kennedy love to make these well known characters (first Han Solo and then Luke Skywalker and now Indiana Jones) into a grumpy person who had a failed personal life and gets divorced, it's something with the old iconic characters which she loves to destroy. Mutt was supposed to take the hat when he was older, now the story has changed. With all that criticism over the way, I also think they managed to do it in a good way, adding extra layers to the first and third acts of the movie through a blunt, emotional reveal. It also offers dramatic motivation, a trauma to dwell on. More than anything, it reflects the more serious nature of part five, whose eulogy for an unpopular addition to the family tree is all part of its attempt to give the legendary Indiana Jones a less-silly parting adventure. As a plot design, the Dial of Destiny was pretty good, mostly as it goes hand in hand with the theme of loss and what you could go back and change if you could. I actually liked the ending, it was a fitting ending to the character of Indiana Jones in his fifth and final movie. According to Mangold and Ford, Dial of Destiny is about age, time and family relationships. Mangold said the film ""is not about aging per se, but time - the way time travels for all of us, the way we all get older as the world changes around us."" I really liked James Mangold's direction and visual storytelling, I just wish the screenplay was better. This film suffers the same as the previous film in the franchise, an overabundance of digital effects and CGI, all of which combine to create a world that is as visually unappealing as it is unconvincing. The musical score by John Williams remains one of the highlights. Steven Spielberg was a executive producer on the film, serving as a mentor to James Mangold aswell .I agree with both of these critics, positive and negative. John Nugent of Empire Magazine gave the film four out of five stars, complimenting Ford's performance, and noted Mangold's camerawork ""moves confidently through action set-piece after action set-piece, keeping up a frantic pace."" David Rooney for The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film, writing ""it's a big, bombastic movie that goes through the motions but never finds much joy in the process, despite John Williams's hard-working score continuously pushing our nostalgia buttons and trying to convince us we're on a wild ride.""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is quite a good adventure film, but it lacks that extra heart which the previous films had. James Mangold tries and you see his love for it. The film left me satisfied and happy, yet also disappointed as the fifth and final installment could have been so much better. Say what you want about George Lucas, this was his character and story, and it's unfortunate we didn't get to see his story for the final film, like what Disney and Kathleen Kennedy did with his sequel trilogy plans. I think any fan of Indiana Jones should watch this, Harrison Ford is great in it and the return of Sallah will be appreciated by many. I think the audience are wrong in rating it so low, It's far from perfect, but it's just great in a lot of ways but also bad in some ways. There's no aliens in this film if you disliked them in climax of the previous film, instead it's time travel and Hollywood is all about time travel and multiverses right now. The villain is less cartoonish and it's why I think he works extremely well, Indiana Jones is also back fighting Nazis. I liked the film and writing this the day after, my opinion haven't changed which it can, seeing a spectacle like this at the cinema is an experience itself. It was an incredible experience! An adventure film for the family.","

Indiana Jones riding off into the sunset at the end of a perfectly satisfying trilogy.Then some bright spark thought we needed aliens & Shia swinging through the trees with the monkeys so we got the abomination which is KOTCS.I was hopeful Dial of Destiny would let Indiana sign off with some dignity but no, we have the PWB show & some kid shoehorned in to try & recreate the chemistry of Short-Round.An Indy adventure with him travelling through time should've been a sure fire hit.Disney, as with Star Wars, have conspired to somehow ruin something which couldn't possibly be ruined!!","

"moviemanager","28 June 2023","This Indiana Jones movie was a tribute to the fans of the movie. I have always liked movies where imagination is used richly. Everything is possible in movies. Harrison Ford is naturally the biggest star of the film. Of course, there are important characters from other parts of the film series. I think the movie got off to a slow start. The opening is also not the best in the film series. The best starting part is still in the last crusade. In the film, we moved forward in time to the 60-70s, corresponding to the real passage of time. Indiana Jones still has enemies in this movies. Actually, the same manifestation of evil that he has often fought against. But then the best part. The end of the film was something really amazing and unprecedented in the film series. You have to see it for yourself. With a smile on my face, I can say that this was a good movie and a great ending to the series...","

"rexmatthewj","19 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final installment in the iconic adventure franchise that started with Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981. Directed by James Mangold and co-written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp, and Mangold himself, the film brings back Harrison Ford as the legendary archaeologist and adventurer, who must once again stop a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist from using a powerful ancient artifact to alter the course of history.The film is set in 1969, a time of social and political turmoil, as well as scientific and technological breakthroughs. The film explores how Indy fits into this changing world, as he faces retirement, loneliness, and grief.The film also features a formidable villain in Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Jurgen Voller, a former Nazi astrophysicist who works for NASA but has a secret agenda. Mikkelsen is menacing and captivating, as he portrays a man who is obsessed with power and glory.The film also suffers from some overuse of CGI effects, especially in the opening sequence where Ford is digitally de-aged to look like his younger self during World War II. The effect is distracting and uncanny, and it takes away from the realism and authenticity of the film. The film also relies too much on familiar action set pieces, such as chases involving trains, cars, bikes, planes, etc. Some of these scenes are thrilling and inventive, but others feel repetitive and derivative. The film also lacks some of the mystery and wonder that made the previous films so captivating.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a mixed bag that offers some entertainment and frustration. It is neither the best nor the worst film in the franchise, but a safe and predictable one that fails to please anyone. It is a film that shows its age and lacks identity. It is a film that could have been better with more originality, creativity, and daring. It is a worthy farewell to one of the most iconic characters in cinema history, but it does not match the brilliance of the original trilogy.","

"sunnycielo","6 December 2023","The first few minites transported me back to the 80's as a kid, first time watching this in the school auditorium on a rainy day schedule. The excitment, the thrills, the music!! Then it all went downhill, quickly i might add. This might as well been a cameo movie for Indy because the women hogged up all the screen. And she wasn't that interesting! Who was this best friend that we NEVER heard of in all of Indys history?? Why was this women given so much screentime? Really, a time wrap, only to stay later on??? And why have this impossible plot hole of a story, at least in the other movies there was a element of realism, this just made you go """"REALLY??"" And most importantly, where was SHORTROUND????!!!! This should of been a passing of the hat for Indy bit we got slighted by this. As i women i am going to say that we do not need a women heroine in every freaking movie. Having said this, *YOU KNOW WHO* should of been more in this movie, it was all about her anyway........","

"Prismark10","9 July 2023","When Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released, it heralded the end of the whip cracking archeologist. By the early 1990s, Spielberg and Lucas were trying to fit in a fourth movie.It eventually emerged as The Kingdom of Lost Skull in 2008. I think it was shot in George Lucas's backyard, with all the money he accumulated, he has a very big yard.Now Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny acknowledges that Harrison Ford is no spring chicken. Lucasfilm has been purchased by Disney, both Lucas and Spielberg are back as executive producers.It starts with a de-aged Indiana Jones along with friend Basil Shaw battling the Nazis on the train to retrieve the holy Lance of Longinus. It turns out to be a fake but he has found half of the Archimedes' Dial.The de-aging is done well although the eyes do look a bit animated. Also some of the scenes are basically stunt doubles with a younger Harrison Ford mask.It then goes forward to New York 1969, Professor Jones is retiring as a lecturer and he lives alone in a crummy apartment. It is also the day of the homecoming parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts.Jones is visited by Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) his goddaughter and the daughter of Basil, she is also an archeologist but she wants money and glory. Helena also wants to know about what happened to the half of the Archimedes' Dial which is thought to be lost.Also after it is Astrophysicist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) who was there with Indiana Jones on that train back in 1944. Now he works for NASA, but he has always remained an unrepentant Nazi.Director James Mangold has tried to keep with the story beats of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom. A search for mythical artefact. Voller wants the dial as it may allow him to go back in time and change the course of Nazi history.As for what happens when the dial starts to work, I think it was a smart time travel move. A nod is owed to the Doctor Who story Blink.As for the movie, given the fact that big blockbuster action adventures roll around several times a month in peak moviegoing season. I enjoyed this. One last ride with Harrison Ford and some senseless fun.Mangold obviously tries to copy the Spielberg formula. David Koepp who is Spielberg's writing fixer is onboard. The one big negative was the movie was too long.","

"Joshmcswain","8 December 2023","Minor spoilers ahead.I watched this film with no expectations since most reviews said it was not good. However, I went into it with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. This isn't some amazing work of cinema, but it's not a bad way to spend 2.5 hours. Watching it once, I am not sure I'd watch it again but it's an alright movie.The biggest quibble is the film is too long. There could have been 15-20 minutes trimmed off the film to make it less of a drag. The opening scene drags, it could have just been Indy stealing the dial instead of an extended scene about the lance that pierced the side of Jesus is a fake and then it's not relevant to the rest of the story.The chase scene was long and could have been shortened.We know that Indiana Jones is about how Indy is changed by those around him, and while he is reconciled with a long lost goddaughter that really can't outdo his long lost son from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Regardless of what you think of Crystal Skull, it seemed like a natural conclusion for Indy.So all in all, as long as your don't have your mind made up beforehand you'll enjoy it even though it is flawed.","

"JapanMovies","30 August 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks another captivating addition to the Indiana Jones film series. It's speculated that this could be the final installment, with Harrison Ford reprising his role as the iconic Indiana Jones for possibly one last time. While Ford may not be performing his own stunts due to his age, his acting skills remain top-notch and impressive. The film's enhanced graphics are visually stunning and add to the thrilling action-packed storyline that fans have come to love. The desire to watch this film repeatedly is undeniable, leaving viewers with a longing for more. For those who have followed Ford's acting career over the years, this film is a fitting end to his portrayal of Indiana Jones.","

"steveinadelaide","22 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks the final instalment in the adventure franchise that began in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. James Mangold directs this film taking the reins from Steven Spielberg. It brings back Harrison Ford as our archaeologist and adventurer in his late 70s and contemplating retirement. Joining him is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, a journalist and novelist who becomes his new sidekick. We also see Antoni Banderas portraying his friend and rival, a treasure hunter. At the same time, Mads Mikkelsen takes on the role of an antagonist who is a Nazi war criminal and occultist with an insatiable desire for the mythic Dial of Destiny that holds immense power to reshape history.The movie pays homage to its predecessors by incorporating references to characters, locations, and artifacts. Alongside these elements, it injects energy and humour through Waller-Bridge's sharp-witted and sarcastic performance, impressive action sequences and stunts. The story delves into Indiana's struggle with aging.Nevertheless, The Dial of Destiny has flaws that prevent it from soaring to the heights of its predecessors. The storyline is quite complicated. It seems unrealistic, with many coincidences and contrived situations. The movie's tone feels inconsistent, shifting between serious, silly, and sentimental, without a sense of coherence. While the direction is competent, it lacks the style and vision often associated with Spielberg's work. The musical score is decent enough but fails to leave a lasting impression. The cinematography comes across as lacking inspiration. As for the production design, it's decent. But it's not remarkable. The special effects vary in quality. At times they can appear cartoonish. The editing feels choppy and unpredictable, affecting the flow of the film. The pacing is sluggish and uneven throughout. And the dialogue tends to rely on clichés and predictable lines.The Dial of Destiny cannot be considered a disaster; however, it falls short of being a masterpiece. It ends up being a forgettable farewell to a character and franchise. Some moments provide fun and excitement, but some feel boring or disappointing. It neither tarnishes nor elevates Indiana Jones's legacy-it simply exists in a way that may please existing fans without attracting ones. Personally speaking, I found myself pleasantly entertained by it.","

But it's still a great movie, I think people are afraid of change and new chapters,
It's entertaining with a new fresh look but still got some pieces of the old nostalgic Indians jones movies.I don't think they could make it much much better then it is, yeah maybe some things could be different but in the end, if you like Indian jones without being a grumpy person that it is affraid of a new chapter, this movie is for you. I would give it 6.8 but let's say 7/10.Just enjoy the movie with great new characters and an real adventure in Indiana spirit,","

"waywarddrifters","30 June 2023","At this point I'm convinced that these corporatists at Disney are deliberately out to destroy every last film franchise that had any spirit within it over the last 45 years or so. How this film gets such praise is beyond me.I saw ""Raiders"" on home video just before ""Temple of Doom"" hit theaters as a boy. It became my favorite action / adventure film of all time, and rivals""Jaws"" as my favorite film of all time. I also loved the first two sequels. However, like most die-hard fans, I can't stand ""Crystal Skull,"" and walked into this film on opening night nervous, but objectively hoping they'd give my childhood cinematic hero the proper send-off. If by proper, had I meant modern, where you can't let a man be competent, strong, and daring, then I guess it fits. But the movie is a dumpster fire.""The Dial of Destiny"" is beyond stale. The horrid green screen effects, the CGI, and the ever-condescending Phoebe Waller-Bridge ruin this film completely. You could have cameoed every notable character from the preceding films, and it still wouldn't save this doomed opus.You want this film summed up bluntly? Take the scene in ""South Park"" where George and Stephen corner Indiana Jones and have their way with him, and multiply it by the tenth power, and you have this mindless, heartless, cash-grab of a film.I adore Harrison Ford, and gave a star for him doing the best he could with a dead-on-arrival script, and I gave a star for Mads Mikkelsen's performance - which was as great as it was underwritten. But that's it. Literally everything else about this movie was them relieving themselves on a cinematic icon - in front of the world.The worst aspect of this film is that it is so poorly written that multiple characters deviate from their established character traits, and say / do things that seem - well - out of character for them. The writing is nothing short of mindless and lazy.Comparable to the bad writing are the rushed and poorly executed special FX. The action scenes in this film make Shia Leboeuf doing his Tarzan impression in ""Crystal Skull"" look like a welcome cinematic escape. Minus the original ""Jurassic Park,"" and ""T2,"" I've never been much for CGI, but this film really nukes the fridge! (Ha!) Some of the FX were so bad that they felt like a jab at the audience. Then there's the ""modern audience"" pandering. I'll spare you. Just know that this film is everything that is wrong with movies in this day and age.The good news is that I doubt Disney can make anywhere near their money back on the steaming dump they took on an icon. And I hope they lose so much money that the only place you can find their logo here soon is in a museum. To do this to a character like Indiana Jones in an effort to keep their ESG score up, and keep the blue-haired mob from threatening them, is a sad, disrespectful end to a largely amazing franchise.It's fitting. Cinema is as dead as critical thought, and our icons now perish in fires built by madmen.As Belloq put it in ""Raiders,""
""Indiana Jones - adieu!""","

"Chi-C-Dawg","30 June 2023","I REALLY enjoyed it, and even loved it at times. A huge improvement over the last one. It definitely is a more mature Indy and a more mature film. It looks darker like more modern cinema, but the story is fun and full of surprises. I will say it drags a little and could have been tightened, but the story is at least coherent compared to Crystal Skull, annd I never didn't enjoy my time in this film. Overall, I had a blast and it was touching. It was nice in a way that it tried to honor rather than capture the magic of the first three movies and really the power of nostalgia. Those movies LOOK and feel different. We've all moved on from there and this movie kind of does too. A good ending.Also some sexy henchman and sailors in this one.","

The dialogue lacked the wit we have come to expect, but it was good enough for a few chuckles.Characters...eh, a little flat. The bad guy was a little wooden, not ""evil"" like Raiders and Doom. The new girl, liked her. Fun, smart, quick, kinda cute, very ""wordly"".The story, this is where I struggled.

Stupid story with a plot that got too many holes and unbelievable mistakes, starting with the knife being a fake after a few seconds from looking at it, all the puzzles and codes being cracked in a matter of a minute or two. Silly action scenes. Too many special effects and SGI, that one can tell that Harrison's scenes were not real, also most of his scenes were done by a stunt double, no wonder him being over 80 years old. There were too many unnecessary characters, like Sallah and Renaldo. Phoebe's and Teddy's characters were most annoying, which I believe ruined the movie. Overall, dry disappointing and annoying movie.","

"cdjh-81125","3 July 2023","So I won't lie, this made me kind of sad. Indiana Jones as a character means so much to me, they were my childhood movies and I've been waiting for a new film since I saw Kingdom of The Crystal Skull in cinemas 15 years ago. It was my most anticipated movie of the year and one of my most anticipated of all time really and it's so sad that for me that it ended up being exceptionally middling which feels so devoid of any energy or anything that really differentiates from any of the other films in the series.Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to like in Dial of Destiny but I'm not really convinced it amounted to much in the end. The opening 20 minutes I thought were basically perfect, it emulates the style of the original trilogy really well (aside from some dodgy CGI) and it absolutely when it feels like the film is at its most energetic and passion filled. It's not gonna come as a surprise to anyone that Harrison Ford is phenomenal in this movie, he's made it no secret that Indiana Jones is the character that means the most to him and seeing his performance in this movie makes that abundantly clear. Despite his age he's still great in all the action scenes, he's still got that great comedic timing and while I thought the film needed a lot more emotional weight than it actually did he always added it whenever the script provided anything for him to work with.Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character is definitely gonna rub some people the wrong way but I have to say I fell for her character pretty quickly. I thought her and Ford had really good chemistry and she just played her character's beats so well that it never failed to charm me. Mads Mikkelsen is proven just how good he is at playing villains and I certainly thought he gave a fine performance there's nothing I found that interesting or compelling about the character. We learn about his motivations far too late and his character arc ends so abruptly that there's no where near enough time for any of his actions to have any sort of real impact.But beyond the writing of the villain my biggest issue with the movie was how it went about tackling its central theme. I only really know from interviews that James Mangold's goal for this film was to explore Indiana at an old age and the ramifications of that on his character. But beyond that I didn't think it was well executed at all in the finished film. Mangold gives us a few brief scenes after the prologue to set up these themes just to forget about them until the last 20 minutes so the character just feels adrift in his own film for most of the runtime. The 3rd act takes a pretty swing that I couldn't fully get on board with, even if I see what Mangold was going for the poor character set up just made the final emotional beats ring totally hollow for me.I also wouldn't say I was that impressed with James Mangold's direction either. Don't get me wrong I completely sympathise with having to follow someone like Steven Spielberg and based on his past films I see why he was seen as a good pick for this movie but there just wasn't that much life behind the camera. I thought all the action scenes were solid but no one set piece that really blew me away and I didn't find there to be a lot of prolonged tension or meaningful build to anything. Dial of Destiny drags pretty considerably, mostly in the 2nd act, and having watched the other films recently you realise just how tightly paced and edited they are with to-the-point run times around about the 2 hour mark. This film was just way too bloated for its own good and I didn't think the plot was anywhere near spectacular enough to justify such a running time.I'm probably coming across as more harsh than I mean to but I just wanted so much more out of this film. There's nothing about it I hated but there's only a few select things I loved and considering how much I like every other Indiana Jones film (yes all of them) that's a pretty substantial step down. I'm sure I'll watch this film again and I'll be curious to see how my opinion evolves but as of now I'm pretty disappointed in something that felt totally without any substantial vision. Too often it felt like a story that just happened to feature Indiana Jones and came across as fan fiction in all the worst ways. I'm definitely happy I got to see another one of these in a theatre, I just wish it was a lot better than it ended up being.","

"Mike_Devine","30 July 2023","After more than 40 years of hearing the iconic theme by John Williams, Harrison Ford dons the famed fedora one last time as he searches for another ancient relic; this time, it's the 'Dial of Destiny.'Yes, Indy can be accused of being washed up in his final globetrotting adventure, but it's still cool to see Dr. Jones go on another wild ride here. For starters, Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays an excellent sidekick in goddaughter-turned-pirate Helena, as she finds a way to bring out the best curmudgeon-y one-liners from Indy. It's also noteworthy that we see the titular character once again battle the Nazis, who are the most formidable and fearsome villains he ever faces (Mads Mikkelsen portrays a particularly sinister Dr. Voller here).While it's easy to pin 'Dial' above the heaping wreck that was 'Crystal Skull,' this only gets the film so far. For one, it's a whopping 154 minutes - an Odyssey by this franchise's standards - and feels every minute as long as this. There's also the ridiculousness of the plot - did anyone have ""time travel"" on their IJ bingo card (although, to be fair, probably no one had ""aliens"" on their cards 15 years ago...)?There are plenty of times throughout 'Dial' that Indy feels like he's just being dragged around from location to location, more of a passenger than a driver, and of course his age has a lot to do with this. Still, the opening sequence is perhaps one of the better ones this franchise has done, and James Mangold deserves credit for taking the risk on this given how flat it could have fallen if the technology hadn't lived up to its potential.No, it's not in the same league as 'Raiders' or 'Crusade,' but this film is fun enough to send Indiana Jones into the sunset on a mostly okay note.","

"chessa-75654","20 September 2023","At first I loved it. Harrison is brilliant even in CGI & the beginning was an Indy movie. I smiled the whole 15 minutes. And then it becomes Logan, depressing & angsty but without a loveable costar when Sallah is left behind. Then it's a ridiculously long chase scene as the uninspiring despicable god- daughter hogs the story with her side-kick street kid. Shades of the aptly named Temple of Doom annoyance levels without the laughs.Mads was his usual expressionless character, which actually worked well for the obsessed Nazi he portrayed. Great scenery, sets & music. The look of the movie is great until the past sequence! I Love the globe trotting adventures of an Indy film. And time travel is something crazy Indy might encounter but it's almost a hiccup in the film & the CGI in the sequence was awful! On top of that Indy gets there, gets a shoulder wound & just wants to give up? Indy never gives up! I needed Indy to be Indy.I certainly didn't need the included sad sack reality check into this character's storyline - the war killed his rebellious kid & grief destroyed marriage injection. GeeZ what a downer! Rip roaring feel-good adventure movies don't go there! Please, where are the creatives who could have written a soaring farewell for Indy.As for Helena Shaw, who writes these awful, materialistic, annoying women characters? Please stop. Indy & Sallah & Marion was the farewell movie I wanted.So this is a mixed bag of good & bad with it's best lying in aspects of it almost being an Indiana Jones movie & it's worst making it miss the mark. Sorry I invested. I liked Crystal Skull better & even the supremely annoying Temple of Doom. I'll always miss the Indiana Jones of Raiders of the Lost Ark & The Last Crusade & grateful for those wild rides!","

"matejkaarnost","3 September 2023","I am puzzled why they must put so much action and fights into the movie. It's many times forced and too long and unlikely to happen. First 20 minutes in past are quite ok, classic Nazi point and retrieval of artifacts. Then it goes all down. I would not say it is worse than fourth Indiana Jones, for sure it at least doesn't have Shia LaBeouf, but Helena is not the best character either.Story has its good places and premise, just some dialogues are very simple and dumb. Obviously, they tried to reuse some of successful things from previous movies like having a kid as ""sidekick"" but would not take it as great addition. Ending last 30min is quite stupid. Not to spoil anything, but having a plane and fly so low that it can be hit by catapult and stay in such a hight for whole time is more than idiotic.It's a pity they do not recreate to movie something like Indiana Jones and fate of Atlantis, which is way better story.6/10 just from nostalgia.","

"BallerinaWick","3 September 2023","As an avid Indiana Jones fan, I can say that ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is the right send-off for our beloved archaeologist-adventurer, Indiana Jones. This film masterfully combines the best elements of action, acting, music, screenplay, and direction, paying homage to the iconic character's legacy while delivering a thrilling and emotional conclusion. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Indiana Jones, gives a performance that reminds us why he is the only one who can truly embody this character. His charisma, wit, and undeniable charm shine through, making it abundantly clear that Ford was born to play this role. The chemistry between Ford and his co-stars, including a brilliant Phoebe Waller-Bridge, is amazing, adding depth to the story.The action sequences in ""Dial of Destiny"" are nothing short of spectacular. James Mangold the Director has tried to match the first 3 movies in crafting heart-pounding and inventive action scenes that pay tribute to the classic Indy style while infusing new energy into the franchise. John Williams, the maestro behind the iconic Indiana Jones theme, delivers yet another unforgettable score. His music is not just a soundtrack but a character in itself, heightening the emotional resonance of key moments and elevating the overall cinematic experience.The screenplay, penned with utmost care and respect for the character's history, cleverly weaves together elements from the previous films. It's a love letter to long-time fans, with subtle references and nods that only true Indy aficionados will catch. The story is engaging, filled with unexpected twists and turns, and provides a satisfying narrative arc for our hero. The direction by James Mangold deserves special praise for capturing the essence of the Indiana Jones franchise while pushing the boundaries of what an adventure film can be. The film's visual style is breathtaking, transporting audiences to exotic locations and ancient ruins, all beautifully shot.Critics may argue that the film relies too heavily on nostalgia, but I believe that this is precisely what makes it so special. ""Dial of Destiny"" is a heartfelt farewell to a character who has been a part of our lives for decades. It's a love letter to the fans who have followed Indy's adventures from the very beginning. To those who have grievances with the film, I can only say this: sometimes, our expectations can be so high, and our attachment to a character so strong, that it's challenging for any film to meet them. ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" may not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't need to. It honours the spirit of adventure, archaeology, and heroism that made us fall in love with Indiana Jones in the first place.In conclusion, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is a befitting end to the Indiana Jones saga. It's a film that celebrates the character's enduring legacy, offers a thrilling cinematic experience, and tugs at the heartstrings of fans. It reminds us that, sometimes, a great film doesn't have to redefine a genre; it just needs to remind us why we fell in love with it in the first place. This is an ode to Indiana Jones that fans will cherish for years to come.","

"j-madej","4 July 2023","We living an an age of outrage...
From different type of social fractions battling it out online and in mainstream media, to internet trolls, which can destroy a movie reception, without actually knowing if the film is good or bad.I suppose everything is matter of taste, but when I heard early reviews of 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' was suggesting that it's pretty bat movie, I took that a little personal.Some of my dearest filmmaking experiences was watching Indiana Jones first 3 installments.I still feel 'Raiders of the lost Ark' might be one of the best adventure movies ever made.And when you hear that the last installment is poorly made and that the legacy of Harrison Ford as Indy is being tarnished, deep sadness and frustration can transpire.However I must say I am actually pleasantly surprised by this 5th film.Yes, It does feel a little too long being 142 minutes long and the ending might feel too much of a stretch, there still is enough quality to feel like legacy of I Indiana Jones has been wrapped up conclusively.The biggest problem I've got with this film it is use of the CGI.The original ' Riders of the lost Ark' was captured all in camera. All the stunts were performed by real stunt performers and there was sense of reality, which took our breath away as we watched action sequences. In modern times CGi makes things look fake and specially the first 20 minutes of the movie, although has that Indy advanture vibe, it gets uneven due to poor visual FX.Specially the de-aging as Harrison moves his head can't maintain the actual realistic look. Moments like that takes you out of the movie. You can try to de age the face but the body posture is of a 78 year old, so it simply doesn't work.But as film progresses it actually gets entertaining thanks to Phoebe Waller-Bridge,, which plays Helena, sort of female version of young Indie.The antagonist Mads Mikkelsen as former Nazi stylized on Wernher von Braun (former Nazi first director of NASA) becomes formidable opponent for our duo. On the way we get introduced to Marilyn boy played by Ethann Isidore l, which is clearly stylized on Short Round, a character from the second movie ,which becomes integral part of the narration. Some old characters from original movies come back although only episodically.'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is far from being perfect movie ,but it also not as bad as the early reviews make you want to believe.There 'a still a lot to like here. As it is usually with American-cinema of late, it's formulaic as you can clearly recognize elements of moments stolen from previous Indiana Jones movies, but in its totality it's definitely better then part 4, which was pretty bad.So, don't listen to internet trolls and check out this final installment of Indian Jones.It is not perfect, but entertaining enough, specially for the fans of this great adventure saga.","

The old magic is gone, and you would be much better off by rewatching 1-3 and call it a day.The whole plot is poorly written, the story is all over the place, same old Nazi vs Indy we have seen many times, it's not just Indy who is getting old, the plots they come up with is apparently written by 12 monkeys locked into a room with one typewriter or AI who knows?As I said, wait for streaming, get a case of beers with a high alcohol content because you will need it to get through this train wreck of a movie that should never have been made, I'm sure all the bots will be out and praising this wonder piece of a cluster#F and it's your money so by all means go watch it if you feel lucky, I'm going to wash my eyes in bleach and knock down a bottle of jack so I can forget I ever watched it.","

"martimusross","29 August 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of DestinyWe had a brilliant strong start, a flashback with Nazis, historical artefacts for the Fuhrer, an elongated fight sequence and our hero dealing with heaps of baddies.As the movie progressed we had a good strong story but, to my mind, the casting just didn't work on many levels. Fiona Waller-Bridge, high marks for duplicity and dedication to the role, low marks for glamour, and chemistry between her and Harrison Ford. Her character seemingly vying for the lead in the movie, no one and mean no one outclasses Indiana Jones.On structure we seem to have quite a repetition of similar scenes and the action sequences were overly long unbalancing the narrative flow. The time travel elements towards the end were a great idea but just poorly executed, such a shame!Two aspects were largely lacking, humour and that dry wry wit that Indiana Jones is defined by, secondly the relationships forged under adversity often of a flirtatious nature. I appreciate Harrison Ford is 81, but Indiana Jones never ages.The camera work and music were great but that was about it. I'm giving this a weak 6 outta 10, meaning it didn't really deliver for the fans and was a pale facsimile of what might have been, however I am glad I watched it, I fear we are at the end of the road with this franchise.","

"mattgardner-30853","18 January 2024","What a boring film, lacks any excitement, its also depressing to see such an old and depressed Indiana, he just looks like a grumpy harrison Ford from real life. Never go back as they say.This type of film should have stayed in the 80s. I love the originals, they were great for their time. So flogging a dead horse and make new stuff disney.Same old same old. Vague back story, reluctant hero, traveling from country to country, death defying situations, caves, sea and slimy creatures. One min he's an old man who can barely walk, next min he's jumping, punching and swinging from ropes.The lead female is a bad choice for the role, acting is fine but she's just not right for the role, it needed a different acting style and looks to pull off what is essentially an unlikeable chatacter. Personally I find her a bit awkward to watch and don't get the fuss.Didn't like the kid much, he also reminds me of ""One Peice"" to much.He got 25 million for this and you can see he just did it for the money, who wouldn't to be fair. Please make sure no more are made, not even with a new lead, just let the story die with some dignity if that's possible.Honestly it was a struggle to sit through this, wanted to turn off half way through.It's all been done before, even the tomb raider franchise did it better than this.To summarise, give it a miss and watch something else, you will thank me.It's exceptionally boring and has absolutely nothing new to offer.One for hard-core fans at most.","

Well, kind of...not. What happened?The story couldn't have a better premise. We are back in the 1940's with those Nazis and they've got an ancient gadget that will guarantee them world domination. Leave it to POW Indy to break out and foil Mads Mikkelsen's evil plan. Even with the anti-aging CG effects, I'm stoked! I'm thinking is going to be the BEST INDY EVER!They should have fleshed out this story and ended the movie with this scene. Kudos to Antonio Banderas, but the movie was all downhill from here.

"paul-allaer","17 July 2023","As ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" (2023 release; 154 min) opens, it's the dying days of WWII, and Indy is caught posing as Nazi officer. It's not long before mayhem ensues involving yet another stolen artifact (of course!). Also caught up in the action is Indy's old friend Basil... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the first Indy movie not directed by Steven Spielberg. Instead James ""Ford v Ferrari"" Mangold steps in, and does reasonably well. The opening 20 minute sequence features a de-aged Harrison Ford, and I was surprised to see how well it worked. It felt quite natural actually. The bulk of the movie is actually set in 1969. The action scenes are a lot of fun, including a hair-raising chase in the opening sequence, and several other chase scenes later in the film. Harrison Ford can play Indiana Jones in his sleep, and looks super comfortable. Basil's daughter. Helena, is played by British actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge with plenty of spunk. I must confess I never saw the 4th Indiana Jones movie (2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), so this was my first new Indiana Jones in almost 35 years. I also admit that my expectations were quite low but since this is supposedly the very last Indiana Jones movie ever, I decided to take a chance on it. I was ultimately fairly pleasantly surprised, even though the movie is a bit too long for its own good (they could've easily trimmed this by 10-15 minutes).""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival and was released in US theaters2 weekends ago. The movie has not done well at the box, not the first and certainly not the last to underwhelm at the box office (the Mission Impossible that opened this weekend could not even get to $60 million, an absolute shocker for what was expected to be the biggest movie of the summer). The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 35 people)> If you are sitting on the fence about seeing the 5th and final Indiana Jones, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion.","

"AvionPrince16","28 June 2023","Ok so i saw that Indiana Jones and i need to say that i enjoyed it and found it pretty interesting and entertaining. I found sometimes that the actions scenes was a little bit too long sometimes and even make me forget why there was fighting at the first place. But to be honest if you are looking for a good adventure action movie; go for it. It dont really bring new things or make a revolution but you will see some new faces and some familiar ones and thats pretty great. The story is pretty simple and dont really make things complicate but i had some surprises (like Helena's character, Indiana Jones and his last wish to die with Archimede; yes the treasure hunt will mainly get focused by the research of this man and Helena's father and the comedy at the last scene worked pretty well; i thought they will do like others movies make the hero die in a dramatic way but it just played with us; if it was the death of Indiana Jones like this it will be very pathetic in my opinion and can be feel like a lazy writing; but they didnt do that and they used comedy instead and it was pretty effective im not gonna lie. The part who really annoyed me a little was the moment whe they go back in the past and meet Archimede; it was kind of a sci fi part and didnt really make me thrill at any moment. But it was ok i guess. The actions scenes was very well excecuted: the lights, the fights and the comedy during some parts but pretty classic overall. I enjoyed the treasure hunt, the investigations, the characters, the comedy and the fights. And for that kind of movie and genre its more than enough. I spend a great time anyway. The mention also of the ""nazis"" and ""Hitler"" make us see a historical part and let us know the context to understand it better. Entertaining for sure.","

"Paula_Ferrand","28 June 2023","A good and enjoyable film despite Waller-Bridge. Her character was little convincing and it's hard to understand her motivations and objectives, they were never clear. She lacks connection and empathy in many situations, like a very immature adult, that makes it feels completely alien to the movie, like she doesn't belong there. Her interpretation feels annoying and obnoxious.However, as a fan, it makes for a nice walk through nostalgia that resumes a long and succesful saga. Ford keeps it charisma it has aged well along with Idiana Jones.I would like it more if it was directed by Spielberg himself, the spirit of the movie would be more fun.","

But also my most feared from a legacy destroying perspective, especially after Crystal Skull. However Dial of Destiny is definitely grounded in classic Indiana Jones spirit. Adventure, action, and humour are all there in abundance. If you're willing to overlook some ropey cgi and the odd humour that doesn't hit its target. There's alot to enjoy and admire. James Mangold deserves credit in the way he has handled such an iconic character.Ford is fantastic as always, as is Mads Mikkelson.

I didn't expect to be wowed and didn't not fear being disappointed. And I got a pretty solid conclusion to the Indiana Jones saga as a result. Is it the best of the series? No, nothing will ever beat the third one. But it's also leaps and bounds from the previous one and I am now very glad they made Dial of Destiny to redeem themselves and end the franchise well. I get that some elements are a bit questionable but all in all, I would still recommend for a last fun ride with Indy.","

"FinalSmash1689","30 June 2023","PROS:
-The opening sequence was great (despite deep-fake Indy)-Harrison Ford gives a great performance.-Mads Mikkelsen is always great.CONS:
-Indy gets the Jake Skywalker treatment. His happy ending from the previous film is completely taken from him.-Phoebe Waller-Bridge is completely unlikeable.-Boring for an adventure movie. Feels very paint by the numbers.-Teddy can just fly a plane by jumping in the cockpit ... okay.-Indy sits out most of the 3rd act, making it ""Helena and the Dial of Destiny"".-The 3rd act reveal is just stupid.-Indy's choice in the 3rd act goes completely against his character.Well, Lucasfilm strikes again. This is The Last Jedi of Indiana Jones. This is a soulless corporate made product. It's an imitation of an imitation. You can tell the script is missing George and Steven's influence. The action feels very modern day and not practical at all like the previous Indiana Jones films. I'm not a fan of Crystal Skull but at least it gave Indy a happy ending and a family. Here, both of those are stripped from him, giving us yet another broken and disenfranchised hero who's here to get shown up by his new female counterpart at every turn (sound familiar). Phoebe Waller-Bridge sinks this film. She's constantly unlikeable, talks down to Indy and even takes center stage in the 3rd act, while Indy sits on the sidelines with a gunshot wound. Speaking of which, the 3rd act of this film is a mess. The reveal of the true purpose of the Dial is ridiculous and feels too 'out-there' even for an Indy movie. Indy makes a choice near the end that is the equivalent of Luke throwing the Lightsaber over his shoulder. Indiana Jones DOES NOT GIVE UP!!! Even when all the odds are against him, he never gives up! Harrison Ford gave a great performance, despite the writing of his character, as does Mads Mikkelsen but they alone cannot save this movie. Indiana Jones ended for me in 1989, when Indy rode off into the sunset. I'll never watch this again. 3/10.","

"Sakaresm","6 September 2023","To be fair, after reading some reviews and hearing about the generally mediocre reception, I had my expectations pretty low. Nevertheless, I liked it! It's not a masterpiece, but definitely better than Crystal Skull.The best thing is that it definitely feels like an Indiana Jones movie; all the action, the story, and the subtle jokes and humor is exactly on the spot! The director clearly had done his homework. Helena's character could have been better, but nothing that would have ruined the movie. It wasn't bad, per se, but there just wasn't that ""something"" that I cannot even directly point at. Mads Mikkelsen as the evil Nazi was great! He is such a great actor and the character was good, too. Even if a bit stereotypical evil bad guy, but that's pretty much what to expect from a movie like this.I'd say the negative thing about the movie was -- a bit ironically -- that it's even a bit too much Indiana Jones. The story and plot was a bit too familiar and predictable, and the characters were nothing unexpected. It felt a tad too much like just a fan service for the fans and it didn't even try to come up with something new. But maybe that's exactly what we needed for a farewell for this franchise. I feel good about leaving Indy into his rest now.(Although, I wouldn't turn down some prequel story with someone new as Indy. Just don't overdo it. Maybe some low key adventure/mystery TV-series, but maybe no more big blockbuster theatrical action movies.)","

(they get back together at the end, but that doesn't fix it).Why is Teddy, the most unimportant and pointless character, even in the movie?Why does Helena INTENTIONALLY try to leave Indy for dead every chance she gets?This movie has no real reason to exist. No motive to getting the dial, the premise of time travel becomes less impactful when we go to some 'random' historical battle rather than 1939.Although I gotta say, the way it was portrayed felt like a more believable premise than aliens.","

Phoebe Waller-Bridge was annoying in my opinion. I don't know, her acting is like that or the character is like that. I watched her for the first time. Frankly, I did not notice any difference in the soundtrack of the movie. But it was still ok. It didn't do well at the box office.

"aaravsengar","3 September 2023","So, I recently caught the newly released Indiana Jones movie, and if I'm being honest, it left me feeling quite underwhelmed. Personally, I found it rather dull and boring, and given its runtime of almost 2:30 hours, that's a lot of time to be uninterested. While there were a few fleeting moments of fun, the film mostly adhered to the same old Indiana Jones formula without bringing anything genuinely new to the table.One of the biggest disappointments for me was the CGI. In this age of advanced technology, I expected better. Unfortunately, the visual effects often felt subpar and failed to create the immersive experience I was hoping for in an Indiana Jones movie. It's a shame because the franchise has a history of breathtaking practical effects, and this installment seemed to rely too heavily on CGI.The addition of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, while talented in her own right, didn't quite fit the classic Indiana Jones concept. Her character felt out of place in the adventure and action-packed world of Indiana Jones. It's not a knock on her acting abilities but rather a question of how well her character integrated into the established narrative.On the bright side, the acting from the rest of the cast was decent. Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role did bring a sense of nostalgia, and he handled the physicality of the role remarkably well. However, the screenplay didn't do him any favors in terms of character development or depth.Overall, if you find yourself with absolutely nothing to do and are a die-hard Indiana Jones fan, you might want to give this movie a shot. It's got the name and some familiar elements, so it might scratch that nostalgia itch. But if you're looking for a fresh, exciting take on the Indiana Jones saga, this one might leave you feeling unsatisfied. Personally, I'd rate it around 5.5 stars - it's watchable but far from memorable.","

"rehmankhilji","2 September 2023","I was really surprised by the bad reviews of this particular sequel and all the comments from haters. Perhaps the group of people who didn't enjoy it aren't the ones who have been following it from the start, can't connect with the movie, its theme, or the emotions it evokes. For instance, ""Indy.""As for the movie, I really liked the Crystal Skull part, although Spielberg's fascination with aliens went a little too far for me.The best way to enjoy the movie more is to not read the reviews, just watch it if you're an Indiana Jones fan. I'm sure you'll be in for a treat. I won't spoil anything by commenting on the characters, as it would take away many surprises.But this edition was indeed a very good one.","

"kopec_chavez","3 July 2023","I love Harrison and I love Indy and it's insult to him and this movies (except the last one with aliens) to end it like this! It was a mess and yes I believe that they change the ending 7 times! The director isn't cut for this movies!Harrison is 80 and they man try very hard to work with what they give him!The music amazing but the rest ... but the worse is Phoebe she just ruins it for me (remember the last James Bond?) her character was insufferable at the end they make her a tinny more like Ake cause she supposed to be the next start of this movies but it was tooooo late!To change Indy personally I know he was mourning his sons death (way to get around no more Shia) but Indy Jones is amazing charismatic positive and not a drunk that no one respects him???? Why ? Cause Disney has to ruin Amazing characters !If your not a fan you will be fine but if you love Indiana Jones it will be very difficult to stand 2 hours and 30 minutes of this insult!","

"Vanmatta","29 June 2023","Where do u start first of all it keep with all the Indiana Jones films action, advantage, keeps u guessing what going to happen. From start to finish it's ride, Harrison ford not changes still the man and Phoebe Waller-Bridge such a great character, she pulls of action with easy. From train, planes, cars and boats it got it all baby. The thing I like about this film is u never know what going to happen which I like very much. The Germans are back in more than one way, there a scene which the north Yorkshire moors railway that set the pace and it's in the new mission impossible film. Anyway get down to the cinema and enjoy.","

"anti_konti","31 July 2023","Over all, it was interesting to watch.Surprising beginning with unbelieving ending.Very dynamic action. Colorful cinematography.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is much Better than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Second movie of James Allen Mangold, that I enjoyed watching after Ford vs Ferrari.It's interesting that Harrison Ford was more nimble in this role than the role in Blade runner 2049 witch was 6 years ago.Mads Mikkelsen was just Mads Mikkelsen.Something I disliked was how flat bad guys were just like in comics or Bond movies.Go and watch it on cinemas - the sound was 20/20.","

"vengeance20","30 June 2023","So, having only seen bits & pieces of the other Indy films & of course, the last one which came out 15 years ago (I'm getting old!), we finally get this long awaited sequel which sees Harrison Ford in his role (for the final time) as the great Indiana Jones! This film however, wasn't the greatest & of course ruined by the modernness of today's climate...!The film sees Indiana Jones in his final in a new mission with a cocky arrogant, but ok sidekick Helena, who turns out to be his brothers daughter whom he hasn't seen in 18 years. Together, they set out to retrieve a Dial which can affect the course of history, which is in the hands of Jurgen Voller who plans on using it for his own personal gain.I found the film the film to be ok, I was expecting it to be much worse to be honest. But, saying that, it wasn't exactly much better. Compared to the last entry, this was a pretty mundane & tired out finale & way for Harrison Ford to bow out of the role as Indiana Jones. You could even see as the film plodded along at a sluggish 2 hours & 23 minutes, that Indiana wasn't being treated with the respect as a legacy character should. He was portrayed as a deadbeat almost.Pheobe Waller Bridge's Character, wow. I would say, the less said about her, the better. But, I can't help but mention what an arrogant, cocky, undermining little madame she was in this flick. She really gives off that ""modern woman"" vibe. That ""Look at me, I'm much smarter than you are you dumb male!"" & to think Daniel Craig hired her to ""spice up"" the script for that god awful Bond Film, No Time To Die. But, that's another rant for another time.Anyway, the action was good as with some of the fights & what salvagable scenes of Indiana being himself were good. The visuals & effects were good & the opening, I'd have to say, is probably the best part of the film. The villain played by Mads (Casino Royale) was good as the villain Jurgen.It's plain to see that Indaian Jones is side-lined in favour of Helena & made to look weak & helpless. Typical in today's climate of films which get hit with that posion. The length of the film is too long at a whopping 143 minutes. The runtime was pretty pittiful too & the film could've been edited down by a good 20-30 minutes. The story was ok, but all over the place & the ending was bitter sweet & weird. You didn't even know when the film was set in, so that was a niggle & like how Harrison Ford is portrayed in this film, the film feels tired & worn out.Overall, it's not too bad, but it's not exactly great. The little action we see, along with what little Indiana Jones was being allowed to be the hero of this flick, it fall very short. The ending while bitter sweet wasn't the greatest. The film is overly long & drawn out with a good villain I must say, but weak & washy story-line & one annoying & arrogant side kick who undermines our supposed leading man at nearly every opportunity. There's some great vissuals to be had along with a great opening & not bad effects. But compared to the 2008 film, this pales drastically in comparrison. If only this had got made before films went... posined with modern tripe. You know what I mean...4/10.","

"stu-miller-353-329893","28 June 2023","Currently sat at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes as I type this. The majority of recent reviews are good, but I was worried after reading some of the caustic reviews.After just watching Dial of Destiny at the cinema, I don't understand them.Let me be as succinct as is practicably possible.Is it as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or Last Crusade? No; doesn't even come close.It is as good as Temple of Doom or Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Yes.Is Phoebe Waller-Bridge annoying? No, she's fantastic. I wasn't keen on Fleabag, but she's fantastic in this! As strong as Marion was, with the cunning of Elsa. The only people Helena Shaw may annoy are the irascible, misogynist minority of Reddit/YouTubers, that open their servile mouths to be willingly breastfed agenda-laden negativity by nay-sayers & no-marks. Helena can pack a punch & her last one is comedy gold.Is the de-aging tech in the opening sequence good? Yes and no. The more you look at it, the more it becomes a bit uncanny valley, but overall the opening sequence is exciting and brilliant, so it doesn't spoil it.Is the film too long? It depends on your point of view, but as it's Indy's final hurrah, I didn't feel that it was overlong.Is the much hyped third act any good? My favourite ending since Raiders. It's brilliant and totally unexpected. Pure bombastic fun. Hey, if you can suspend your belief for the 'power of god' in Raiders or 'interdimensional beings' in Crystal Skull, then you can easily enjoy this!John Williams' score, especially when punctuating the 'events' of the last half hour, is fantastic. Maybe not as memorable as some of others in the franchise, but so, so good all the same. His discordant painting of Voller is great.I honestly loved it, and am listening to the Original Soundtrack on Spotify as I type this, which was also released today.See it for yourself. Form your OWN opinion. I did, and am so glad.","

"r96sk","24 October 2023","Feels needless, but 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' still gave me suitable entertainment.I'd personally rank it higher than 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', though to be honest I feel similarly about all five films from this franchise - evidently, given I've rated them all 7/10. I wasn't someone who grew up with this series and when I finally did watch it well over three years ago I didn't connect to them massively, so this fifth installment isn't too far adrift from the original trilogy. If this was much shorter, I may have even liked this more if I'm to be truthful.So yeah, I found the run time to be excessive. It's actually paced relatively well, I'm just not convinced the story itself needed to be told over almost two and a half hours. There is good action adventure in this and the music is done nicely, that theme even gives me goosebumps despite my lack of strong affection for the films.Cast-wise, it's positive. I'm not that much of a fan of Harrison Ford if I'm honest, don't get me wrong I have literally zero against the guy either but from this franchise and that certain other space franchise (I forget the name...) he has never stood out to me strangely. In these and those, I prefer others. Admittedly, I wanna check out his other work away from these sorta flicks. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is very good, as is Mads Mikkelsen. Ethann Isidore and Boyd Holbrook play their parts too.Overall, it's worth watching. The opening and closing sequences are my favourite bits.","

"cjbarrett","3 December 2023","I'd put off watching this final installment because word of mouth among my friends wasn't good. My expectations were lowered but still, I'm puzzled by the shallowness of of this effort. Phoebe Waller -Bridge's character is basically just obnoxious. Think Shia LaBeouf with boobs.One of the hallmarks of the Indy films has always been the humor. But
when the titular character is the butt of most of the jokes, you're not winning any admirers. Also the choice to play most of the action sequences in half light, may have helped disguise some of Ford's age but ultimately sells a remarkable actor short. We're aware of his age, we're here watching because we respect and love him and his craft.In the end, disheartening and unsatisfying.","

"ashleylorraine09","10 August 2023","Okay, so let me start with the fact that Indiana Jones is nostalgic for me. I grew up watching it (at home on vhs, as I wasn't alive for the theater releases). So after crystal skull I was so disappointed. That movie had some fun points but the storyline was awful. I mean aliens? Really?But this movie kept more with history/archaeology which I feel helped a lot.The acting was good, script seemed good, and the action scenes weren't too over the top, yet still fun. The storyline gave you a small bit of heartbreak (if you easily get engrossed into movies) and I also loved the ending. It wrapped up the series and the story of Indiana Jones in a way that I felt did the series justice (Harrison Ford has openly said that this was the final time he would be playing Indiana Jones, prior to the movies release).I felt it was the comeback we needed from Crystal Skull, and I don't think I could have asked for much more considering what we had to work with. The Last Crusade will always be my favorite, but this one gave me ""the feels"".","

"mjbakker-72764","17 November 2023","Saw it, didn't like it. Typically Disney.Why does Disney want to destroy all good franchises.First the theme parks, then Starwars, then Marvel, now Indiana Jones.Aren't the sales numbers enough for Disney to make them realize that this is not working?The movie is literally destroying Indiana, to make place for this Wombat, that seriously has the charisma of what i found in the toilet this morning.Not that his so called son is taking over, no he was conveniently killed in some war.Well all in all, Disney is going to stop the franchise anyway because they lost like 100/200 million dollars on this one and it was well deserved.At least it will die a silent death and if we forget this one and remember Harrison in the first 4 movies, then Indiana Jones will still be a legacy.Btw, what was wrong about the idea to give Harrison the same treat as Sean Connery got. At least they gave him respect and an awesome role in the 3rd movie.Ah forgot, that was under Spielberg and not some narcissistic director from Disney.Also people giving high ratings to this movie are lying. Look at how many millions this movie lost, that was not because it was misjudged or misunderstood, it was just because it was not an Indiana Jones movie anymore.","

"Movie_Beta","15 November 2023","The Dial of Destiny is the 5th film in the Indiana Jones franchise and a real throwback considering the gaps between sequels.I have to admit being sceptical about the much publicised de-aging of Harrison Ford for this role, but it was all done very well. Of course we get Nazi's and some must have ancient Macguffin to chase, and in this particular movie, some added 1960's setting nostalgia (The Beatles, Moon Landing etc). It is a bit overlong and too reliant on CGI effects which I feel is a missed opportunity given that real stunts and effects really made the original movie(s).The acting is good, especially Pheobe Waller-Bridge adding a quirky dynamic and Mads Mikkelsen as a convincing baddie. Adding a token kid sidekick plays a bit too much to the 'Short Round' character in the Temple of Doom, without pulling off the goofiness or fun of it. Harrison Ford looks his age and at times does not seem fully with it which is not great to see. Surely this has to be the last...Overall it is a good old fashioned nostalgia hit, though the epic length forces us to not forget this is a 2020's movie. Good intentions but more plot focus and less CGI would have done the job faster and better.7/10.","

I don't want to watch another minute.Too much CGI which just doesn't fit with me, it's all game console like detached from reality.Yes, Harrison Ford is an old man now and can't do difficult and dangerous stunts, but the fake backgrounds are like some poor rip off of the originals.The CGI gives him a younger man's appearance but he still has his old man's voice.I'm not laughing at any of the one liners. They're as old as the dinosaurs.Everything is dark and dreary.Depressing.It's sad watching this, I can't take anymore of this.I'm off to play wordle instead.","

"the_mysteriousx","31 July 2023","This seems to be the last Indiana Jones film with Harrison Ford. I certainly hope they do not make another, even with another actor. Indiana Jones was created in the late 1970s as a homage to movie serials of the 1930s. This character, therefore, is tremendously out of place in the 2020s. No one living today really remembers the 30s and the 1980s were a very long time ago now. James Mangold, however, has succeeded in giving the movie serials of yesteryear a fitting ""Goodbye"" with this film.The core theme in Dial of Destiny is about what happens when you get to the end of life and I think the somewhat depressing nature of that reality is why the film hasn't done what was expected at the box office. Younger audiences not embracing it is not surprising - they want something fresh and new. The last Indiana Jones film came out in 2008 and you need to be at least in your 20s to remember seeing that in the theater. When you combine that with the mystifying fact that Disney has owned this character for 10 years and done absolutely nothing to promote it (Disney never even bothered putting it on Disney + all these years until now!!) makes it easy to see why only fans who watched these films in the 1980s were the ones who primarily saw Dial of Destiny in the theater. I don't think most people under 20 give a thought as to who Indiana Jones is. It's going to make about $400 million and when you stop and think that any film with an 80 year-old lead can do that, it's pretty amazing honestly. Why did Disney think a franchise with no new material in 15 years and with an 80 year-old lead could do a billion?!?!Indiana Jones, the character, is out of his element in 1969. American culture has completely changed from his heyday in the 1930s. Harrison Ford plays a lonelier version of the adventurous character. He is not a family man and never settled down, so we see him at the end of his job as a professor and retiring to his small apartment in New York City with no real plan for what to do with his remaining time. This is when adventure comes to find him one more time.His goddaughter, with unknown motives, tracks him down during one of his final classes and is looking for the Antikythera mechanism, a real artifact discovered in 1902 off the namesake Greek Island. It's entire purpose and design are still a mystery and the film goes big on this. I won't spoil it, but the ""magical power"" of this device gives the Indiana Jones character an opportunity for a poetically appropriate finale. Indiana Jones has always been a passionate student about history. I was very happy to see him embrace this passion in a way he never could in the previous films. Mangold succeeds in delivering a final story arc for Indiana Jones.There is a good deal of action, but really 3 main set pieces - the train scene of 1944; the horse chase in NYC and then the chase in Morocco. Other moments rely more on suspense than action and this is a smart and logical way to deal with Indiana Jones, who is supposed to be about 70 years-old in this film. Ford is simply terrific in his iconic role. He nails the emotions of this character without the nostalgia or self-pity that would be so easy to instill. It was nice to see John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen have solid moments of support. The other actors were all excellent with Mads Mikkelsen making a terrifically deplorable villain, who has a major bone to pick with Nazi history.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is far from perfect, but it's a terrific closer for Indiana Jones. Disney is who failed this film. Indiana Jones should have been promoted by them for many years and the budget was simply bloated. The cast and crew should be proud of the film. The filmmakers honored Indiana Jones, the original vision of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and the serials that inspired them as children.I have a feeling this film will gather admiration with time. As age and reflection on life are the main themes and as we all get older, more and more audiences will identify with what Indiana Jones has to go through in the film. Thank you, Harrison Ford, and Thank you, John Williams, for everything.","

"fernandoschiavi","13 January 2024","The film is set in the early 1970s, a time of diverse cultural changes in the USA and around the world. Indy (Ford) is a university professor about to retire and feels the transformations that are happening firsthand. It's as if the world no longer had room for a man who lived like him, and for his knowledge. In this context, Helena, the protagonist's goddaughter, appears, who sets him on a new adventure in search of a powerful artifact. From this context, director James Mangold (Logan, Ford vs. Ferrari) makes a constant play between past and future, tradition and modernity, in a clear nod to those who have followed the adventures of Indiana Jones over the decades and, perhaps like him, feel like you have lost space in the world. It's as if the film were a ""safe place"", delivering a classic archaeologist adventure, full of trips to different countries, escapes from impossible places and, of course, a lot of beating up Nazis. Such a choice can make ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" sound repetitive at certain times, but it is also possible to see all of this as a great tribute, taking into account that this film should mark the character's farewell - at least until Disney change your mind. Fortunately, although he focuses heavily on scenes that mirror Indy's already known adventures, Mangold doesn't weigh in on nostalgia and focuses more on the aforementioned generational conflict, sometimes even in a visual way. In a certain scene, for example, Indiana uses a horse to escape, while her tormentor uses a motorcycle to try to overcome her speed. It's the old debate between what's worth more in society: the breath of youth or the experience of older people.Time, as a recurring theme in the film, which opens with a sequence of flashbacks that serves as an introduction to both the villain and Antikythera. Soon after, we are taken to 1969, where we see Indy, out of time, at his retirement party, where he receives a watch. The archaeologist's dissatisfaction with the direction of the world is clear, wars (which even took away his son), high government spending on futile things (trip to the Moon) and people's lack of interest in history (the class he teaches is not dedicated to your class). This way, when he sees the possibility of returning to a time that he considers better, through Antikythera Indy, even if he doesn't admit it, he becomes a little happier. The same happens with his antagonist, the difference is that Voller does not hide his desire to remain in the past. The course of the plot ends up taking the characters to Antiquity, and the adventurer chooses not to return to the present time, but is stopped by Helena. Finally, through this, Indy realizes that it is not possible to stop time, and the character learns to value his present and the people around him, whether they are old companions or new friends. The great achievement of James Mangold's film is to prove that not even the great Indiana Jones is capable of beating time.Returning to the opening scene, the young version of Indy, created by computer graphics, completely clashes with the film and could easily be discarded, even occupying the first twenty minutes of the production. In moving parts, for example, it is clear that we are seeing a digital Indiana Jones, who even tries to repeat Harrison Ford's mannerisms, but never really gets there. While the facial rejuvenation technique isn't as bothersome in the close-up scenes on Ford's face, as strange as it may sound, at other times the sensation is different. The best example of this are the scenes on top of the train cars, in which Indy's digital doll runs over the top of the cars and then in the fight with the Nazis, fooling absolutely no one. In addition to the movement and choreography being conceived and executed without any inventiveness, the CGI with the movement of the train and the landscape on the sides is embarrassing. Disney has often invested in showing hyper-realistic digital versions of its characters, but in this film, it is very clear that you can even replicate the appearance of a star like Ford, but you will never be able to recreate a real talent. What's more: is it really necessary to rejuvenate an actor who is still active, just to put several action sequences in an unnecessary flashback? It's as if the studio itself was against the film's argument, indicating that youth will always have more space than experience.In this sense, Ford once again demonstrates his deep understanding of the character, whose tiredness gives way to excitement as soon as someone shows interest in what is being said by the professor, making it clear how his passion for archeology remains intact beneath his exhausted posture. Likewise, Indy remains human and believable even in the most absurd situations thanks to the way the actor exposes the protagonist's fear (more: panic) in several of them. On the other hand, the presence of John Rhys-Davies as Sallah never escapes pure fan service, not being justified by the plot or by any opportunity to create a memorable moment for the character. And if Phoebe Waller-Bridge presents herself as an interesting addition to the series (as much as the script always tries to make her a female version of Indiana Jones, as a woman with practically genius intelligence and free of defects and who also has a hard time making up her mind whether he will treat her as an ally of the protagonist or not), young Ethann Isidore never manages to transform Teddy into anything more than a faded echo of the Short Round played by Ke Huy Quan in ""The Temple of Doom"", being absolutely disposable for the narrative. To top it all off, Mads Mikkelsen and Boyd Holbrook create an efficient pair of villains with motivations whose insanity is amusingly masked by the seriousness with which they are expressed.Directed by James Mangold (""Ford vs. Ferrari""), the film features breathtaking action scenes from beginning to end. Furthermore, using computer graphics, the production removes Harrison Ford to place him in an adventure aboard a train in the past, as a way of contextualizing the plot. By constructing a plot, with a look and structure that is very reminiscent of films from the 1980s, Mangold gets the nostalgia and preservation of the essence of the character's adventures right. On the other hand, by constructing action scenes with quick cuts and full of CGI, he embraces a modern style of cinematography, uniting the best of two worlds for all ages. Mangold does an adequate job most of the time, creating efficient moments in the middle of elaborate set pieces such as the horse chase and the one involving rickshaws, but which suffer due to an excess of unconvincing digital effects and which disappoint even in basic shots such as the establishing shots at an airport and casino-hotel in Tangier, which fail to disguise that they were filmed on green screen. Furthermore, while Spielberg always found ways to give plausibility to the most fanciful passages (jumps between vines aside), Mangold shows a little more difficulty in repeating this feat - and if we can believe the ""invisible"" bridge in ""The Last Crusade"" and in the carriage that returns to the track after a long jump in ""Temple of Doom"", we cannot say the same about the horse on the subway line in ""Dial of the Destiny"".""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is a fun adventure, but leaves something to be desired in some aspects. The film improves on its predecessor, presenting a simple plot and exploring the maturation of Indiana Jones' character. The performances are strong points. However, James Mangold's direction fails to deliver impactful action sequences and to capture the essence of the previous films. The absence of iconic scenes and uncertainty about the future of the franchise are also points of concern. Overall, it's a fan-pleasing adventure, but one that could have reached a higher level with more careful execution. It makes you want to see more of that Indiana Jones from the first twenty minutes, exploring the anonymous life of a university professor or, riding a horse on the subway. These are much more exciting scenes than everything else the film presents to us. Indiana Jones and the ""Dial of the Destiny"" is not a bad film or even a disastrous one, but it lacks heart. And this is the biggest sin in a franchise like this, so loved over the decades. And the ideal, even for those who like the saga, is that the franchise comes to an end or at least rests for a long time, as we see a clear wear and tear and immense difficulty for the screenwriters to create something new that is truly worthwhile. Not to mention the fact that Harrison Ford can no longer do action scenes like he used to and that the character of Waller Bridge doesn't have an ounce of Ford's charisma and integrity to carry the franchise on his shoulders in the future.","

"jinx_malone","30 June 2023","Then I wouldn't have bothered to see the picture, now would I? I'm paraphrasing, of course, but this has become such a tired refrain in movies these days. I wonder if it'll ever stop? This time out they get the always lovely Mads Mikkelsen to do the honors, but even his (evil!) charm can't prevent the annoyance I feel that I'm being lectured to, yet again.In order to review this movie, I have to talk about the day I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark with my dad. I was ten. It was my absolute favorite movie as a little girl. I liked Star Wars okay, but...My dad had read articles in the paper about Raiders, and heard the radio ads and couldn't wait for it to come out. He was super excited that he was going to see a modern day take on the serials he had loved so much when he was a little boy. It was especially cool for me; my family were all huge movie lovers, but this was the first time me and my dad would ever see a movie by ourselves. Mom liked mysteries and romances, dad liked sci-fi and adventure, and I loved classics and horror. Our household covered all the genre bases nicely! This time out though, she just wasn't interested. So we waved goodbye, and off we went. Me and dad got our tickets, waited patiently in line at the concession stand and splurged on jujubes and twizzlers and sno-caps and giant sodas and our own tubs of popcorn. Staggering under the weight of candy and enough extra 'butter' to feed twenty people, we got our favorite seats-dead center and in the last row of the first section-and settled in. I never had a better time at the movies. Sitting there with my dad, I could see right away why he had loved these movies when he was a boy. You couldn't help but love them. It was like being on a roller coaster, so many twists and turns, seeing far-flung corners of the world, tombs and treasures and romance and adventure and SNAKES, great music, wonderful good guys to cheer for and the most evil villains to hiss at. Marion was tough and beautiful and I wanted to be her, running that bar in the snowy wilds of Nepal and drinking all the men under the table with a gleam in her eye; Indiana himself the perfect hero, smart and funny and brave and handsome-he was my first crush-and it was the most fun I ever had at the movies. It's because it *was* a terrific movie, but also because every time I peeked over at my dad, he had a truly wonderful look of sheer happiness on his face-so much like a little kid again himself, he was so caught up in the movie. When it was done, we left the theater, shouting and laughing about all the coolest parts (just shoot him!) and the grossest parts (melting Nazis!) and talked about it all the way home, we just couldn't stop going over it. Of course, mom wanted to see it right away! It was the perfect movie to see with my dad, and an experience I'll always look back on with happiness, especially now that he's not with us anymore.I'm sure most of you already know what this picture's about, so I'll keep this brutally short and say that I'm so glad the rumors weren't true, (or so glad they reshot the ending) and I'm also glad I got in for free. Nothing will ever change the fact that in my world, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. Lives happily ever after in a dizzying rush of treasure and romance and adventure, always young and strong, always a hero.Thanks for taking me to the movies, Dad. I miss you.","

"noshouse","1 September 2023","As always, ""the Dial of Destiny"" kicks off with a quest to snatch a certain treasure. Although having watched the trailer and behind-the-scenes footage, besides admiring the impressive CGI, I must admit that it's this opening segment that forms a time-linked connection for me. As a long-time ""Indiana Jones"" fan, it's heartwarming to see my childhood and adolescent hero still embodying the same spirit, even as Harrison Ford has aged. It feels like witnessing Michael Jordan sprinting on the basketball court when I'm fifty. Returning to ""the Dial of Destiny,"" I appreciate how the screenwriter used modern scientific research to highlight the uniqueness of ""the Dial of Destiny"" in this installment. It's a treat for both mystery enthusiasts and curious minds who enjoy scientific reasoning. Without comparing it to the earlier series, it's definitely worth enjoying these two hours in the cinema.","

"suvechhabose","1 September 2023","The beginning of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny sees the titular hero captured by the Nazis. When they take him away to execute him, they tie a rope around his neck and prepare for his hanging. However, an American bomb lands at their feet, and the Nazis scatter in an attempt to avoid the explosion.Once the bomb goes off, the Nazis are all dead, and the room is eviscerated from the explosion. However, Indiana Jones is unharmed, completely safe from the bomb, despite his only defense being the fact that his neck has a rope around it. Perhaps Indiana Jones surviving a nuke in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't so far-fetched now.I had to write it, it happens before anything
The building survived!Its still standing today guys , i thought bombs that big are crazy but woof.","

"sachin-jhunjhun","1 July 2023","No character build up, random unbelievable action scenes .. that lengthy rickshaw scene in Morocco was one of the worst unreal action sequences I have ever seen and almost felt cartoonish where they fall off stairs, buildings, hit cars, dodger bullets etc without any sense of realism and you know nothing will happen to them. Characters jump from one location to another without any logic.. The main villain/nazi in the movie is stranded on a boat by Indie who seemingly can drive from Morocco to Italy in a small motor boat and the villain just uses his binoculars to see that Indie who was supposed to be going to particular country in Europe is going to another city in Italy.. absolute drivel! Don't get me started on the ridiculous mathematics based time travel plot!! I have insomnia and slept twice through the movie while my wife slept for the last one hour. Forget Indian jones this has to be the the worst movie I have watched in a long time!!","

"pmtelefon","22 July 2023","When I went to the theater today (AMC Westbury, NY) was I wasn't really expecting much. ""Indians Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" fits in fine with the other movies in the series. ""Dial of Destiny"" takes a long time to get going but after the first hour, it's actually pretty good. Harrison Ford looks good at times. Other times he looks old. Then there are times when he looks really old. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is not nearly as annoying as people are saying. She's fine in this movie. I had a hard time adjusting to how the movie looked for quite a while. However, I thought the last hour looked great. I'm not the biggest fan of the Indiana Jones franchise (I only like the first and third movies) but I can't see any real fan of the series being let down by ""Dial of Destiny"".","

"Isak777","13 July 2023","I saw it in a theater, and I was hoping to enjoy it.The things I didn't like is that they animated Harrison Ford's face to look younger in the beginning of the movie when he was fighting nazis, but that's not that bad because they had, because Harrison Ford is too old. I didn't like that Steven Spielberg didn't direct the film because he refused to, but the director James Mangold is also a great director of such films as Logan or Ford V Ferrari. I also didn't like the time travel thing. At first when they are going back in time to go to World War II, they end up way before World War II and they meet the mathematician Archimedes, but it was fun to watch.I liked the action so much with the music by John Williams. Harrison Ford of course. Mads Mikkelsen as a villain Nazi was just a brilliant acting and he is such a great actor.Anyways the movie is better than I thought it was going to be and the movie sadly bombed box office, but I think it's a great experience in a theater.","

"laplante-co-672-297856","15 August 2023","The cons:The opening set piece did a good job of recapturing the aesthetic of the original series. CGI Indy was visually impressive, but for the odd uncanny valley glimpse here and there. More notably though, it didn't feature the visual and scripted gags that were a hallmark of Spielberg's first trilogy. It's almost business-like in the way that it sets up the rest of the movie.Like Crystal Skull, this adventure is rooted more in science fiction than classic archeology. The time travel gimmick just did not work for me. Time travel movies always create paradoxes that can't be resolved... or they create more questions than they answer. This one is no different. Does the dial create the rifts or just find them? Indy informs Voller that Archimedes' didn't know about continental drift, therefore the rift they are headed for will not take them to 1939. But, in a too-wild-to-believe coincidence, the continental drift error takes them to Archimedes himself. What is the probability of that, especially considering that neither Voller or Indy take into consideration the vast movements of the earth around the sun and the movement of the entire solar system through the galaxy? Archimedes himself would not have known about these celestial movements at all so the calibration of his Dial should have been even more wildly inaccurate.There is a huge cloud of melancholy that hangs over Indy in his senior years. Loved ones have died, or moved away. He's living in a squalid apartment, falling asleep in front of his TV night after night. His accomplishments in past adventures -- including as a spy(!) as we learned in Kingdom -- have not earned him any sort of recognition or interest from either the public or the government.The action sequences are missing the tension was drawn out in the early movies in similar scenes? Remember the very first movie? In the first ten minutes, we saw Indy barely outrun a boulder, pull at his whip frantically to get himself out of the hole and under the closing stone gate, race across fields with arrows and blow guns at his back... Who can forget that fight between Indy and the huge German as an out of control airplane slowly circles around them? The chase scenes and such in this movie are competent, but never generate that level of ""OMIGOD!-will-he- make-it-in-time?"" that we saw in the original movies.The pros:The death of Mutt Jones. I expected that there would be a throwaway line about how Indy and Marion's son was off living his own life and adventures as a way to explain his absence. Instead, the character is effectively used to provide context to Indy's weary attitude, and to explain the absence of Marion.The return of Marion. We all wanted Indy to finish up on a positive note. After a movie and a sequence where we get sad and depressed Indy, the movie comes full circle (again) for both of these characters.Helena. I actually liked the prickly relationship between Indy and Helena. I thought it was justified very well, and it evolved organically into the mutual admiration and affection that we eventually see. That said, I don't see a need to continue the series... or a spin-off series... with this character. The Indy series ends in the 60s, well past the time of the earlier trilogy, which were a tribute to pulp novels and cliffhanger serial movies. The producers will never be able to recapture the spirit of those earlier movies.","

'Finding himself in a new era, approaching retirement, Indy wrestles with fitting into a world that seems to have outgrown him. But as the tentacles of an all-too-familiar evil return in the form of an old rival, Indy must don his hat and pick up his whip once more to make sure an ancient and powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.'
I actually really enjoyed this one. It has its flaws, particularly that third act, but I felt it was a solid send off to Indie. I think it had its moments to shine, and I enjoyed it.The opening to the film is a de-aged Indie fighting the nazis. It actually looks pretty good, and the de-ageing was very solid. I also felt like it felt like the original trilogy, and I was hooked by that opening. I also noticed James Mangold's unique style here. I actually really enjoyed his style, and I feel a new director was needed because we had 4 Spielberg films in a row, and I felt him falling off. While I don't think that Mangold was as good as he was in Logan, that was one of the best Comic book films of all time. He brings a unique style, with his colour grading, and I was happy with him in the director's chair.The first act saw Indie's look at life, and his lack of feeling welcome. I love his performance from Harrison Ford. I didn't love Ford in Kingdom of Crystal Skull, but he was great here. He did a Blade Runner 2049 level performance here, and I felt the emotion. My main issue with his character is why he feels not welcome. There is a reveal, about half way through the film, that is so important I think it should have been shown, not told. The first act I feel could have been a bit longer. Within 10 minutes of seeing Indie older, there is another scene of raiding, which I feel makes us not fully be able to resonate with Indie. Indie meets the main side character, Helena, played by Phoebe Waller Bridge. She began being not that likeable, and I wasn't really into her character. But as we went on, she became more likeable. Also, Phoebe Waller Bridge played the character very well. We are introduced to are villains, the main one being Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen. I felt he was slightly generic, and the way they try to make you hate him wasn't the best. However, Mads Mikkelsen was great and really committed. The other two villains are henchmen, played by Boyd Holbrook and Olivier Richters. I actually really enjoyed them, but they were quite generic. I also have to mention how wasted Shaunette Renée Wilson's character of Mason feels, who I feel had a lot of potential. The first act has a lot of fun to be had, as we see chases, horse riding and action scenes. Obviously Harrison Ford can't do all of the stunts, but I feel he did his best.The second act has a couple of issues. For one, we see a lot of Indie's friends, however, they are only in one or two scenes. It kind of feels like they were trying to do fan service, but they didn't do it very well. Also, it felt like at one point, they realised that they needed to have an action scene, so just have a random action scene, with a random other party. It just felt like they needed a certain number of action scenes, so just put random people in here. I also had some issues with John Williams score, almost feeling like it was the wrong time. There is a chase scene, and then it just plays epic hero music. It was just frustrating. We also met the character of Teddy, who was one of the weaker elements. I don't like to hate on child actors, but I just don't like the performance. It kind of feels like a rip off of Short Round from the Temple of Doom, just not done too well. There are three action scenes in the second act, which I think is a bit too many. This hurts the pacing a bit, as I would have liked to see more character moments, but the good thing is you are never bored. We see Mads Mikkelsen fully commit here, which does make them quite fun. There is an underwater scene which I feel does lot look to good, so I was kind of taken out of the film. Also, there is some quite interesting editing from Andrew Buckland, Michael McCusker and Dirk Westervelt. I'm not sure it's my favourite editing in the world, but it is interesting.The third act is where the main issue comes in. The main device is one that can turn back time, and I knew what was going to happen but didn't like when it happened. I feel like the character arcs for our main characters all mostly worked, apart from Indie, more on that later. The villain doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion, so that was also frustrating. I just feel like the third act was so crazy, and out there, that I didn't really enjoy it too well. It felt too cgi filled and felt not like the rest of the film. However, I do actually think that the visuals were good, and the cinematography from Phedon Papamichael was super enjoyable. The fight choreography was also a treat. However, the most frustrating thing was how Indiana Jones' character arc ended. I don't want to go into spoilers, but it tries to do something that just doesn't work, and then tries something else, which again, doesn't work. It was frustrating because Indiana Jones himself is the most important part of the film, and they don't get him right.Overall, this film is a fun time. Harrison Ford deliver my favourite performance of the series, James Mangold has some interesting direction, and the visuals are stunning. However, the third act gets too crazy, and fails to give a good send off to Indiana Jones.My score is:

"CANpatbuck3664","12 July 2023","I'm probably not alone in this opinion but one of the things that really separates Indiana Jones' adventures as such an amazing series is how funny these movies are. Harrison's an underrated comic talent and I laugh uproariously every time I watch Raiders or the Last Crusade (Temple of Doom as well but maybe a little less often). There were scenes that garnered some hearty laughs from me in Dial of Destiny but it was a little more spotty. I think part of this is that Indy is a more inherently beaten-down and sad character after the tragedy he's suffered but the proceedings overall feel a little more serious and that choice comes with it's pros and cons. Indy has always succeeded through a combination of book smarts, street smarts and more than a few lucky bounces and while the new creative team was aware of that, I think they could have played into it more. They might have over-corrected a little from how silly Crystal Skull ended up being.James Mangold takes over as the mantle of director from industry titan Steven Spielberg and I would think part of the reason he got the gig is his experience with big budget action flicks (Mangold's past credits include Logan, Ford v Ferarri and 3:10 to Yuma among others). Dial has a ton of action and there's a concerted effort to follow in the same style as the previous entries of the franchise. If there's an area where Dial really stands on it's own two feet, in my opinion it's in the action set-pieces. They ebb and flow well and while they have the same kind of flavour, they do their own thing with it (they show a lot more of the carnage without being too gratuitous). Does anything approach the original trilogy? I'd still say no but the Indy movies are the gold standard for a reason. I don't think there's another movie period that so seamlessly blends how thrilling, effortlessly funny and memorable those scenes are. So I can't penalize Dial too harshly for being solid if unspectacular in this area.Harrison Ford loves playing Indy and it's perhaps the defining role of his career (I prefer Indy to Han, just my opinion). He's still good as Henry Jones Jr. Here but he understandably is limited by his age (e.g. The CGI on younger Indy is pretty good but it's weird hearing older Harrison Ford's voice come out of his younger computer-generated body). He's still a treat to watch as this character and he does what he can. The star of the show and the biggest surprise of the movie for me was Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw. I'm not familiar with Fleabag so I didn't really have any previous experience with her work but I was really surprised with how effortless her charisma and her performance were here. She was great working with Harrison, she handled both the dramatic and the comedic moments deftly and she succeeded whether others had previously failed. It was great to see John Rhys-Davies as Sallah again, he came to play and while he's aged quite a bit, he brought Sallah's enthusiasm and joy to this project as well. Getting Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Vollmer was great casting, he gets the job done in Dial but I wish they had given him more solo screentime. He's an amazing actor and he deserved a more developed part to play. Ditto for Antonio Banderas as Renaldo, he's got screen presence for days and I was disappointed that there wasn't more chances for him to show off his comic chops. Toby Jones was cast well as Basil Shaw, he's a great character actor, he's more the Sean Connery type of sidekick and it suits him. I did want to point out the one performance that really stood out but not in a good way. I've liked Boyd Holbrook in other projects but I was taken aback by how out of sync he seemed with everything else. I couldn't tell if he was supposed to be comedic relief or a scary and ruthless killer, it seemed to flip flop depending on the scene. I still think he's a good actor but I was legitimately confused at what he and the movie were trying to do with his character.While I like the movie overall, I also don't disagree with some of the criticism being lobbied at it. The movie pops when it needs to but underneath the on-screen product, it did feel too pat and a little manipulative. The studio obviously poured a ton of money into this and instead of what felt like cinematic magic in the original trilogy, Dial feels like the movie was calculated to the most finite degree. Dial is over-manufactured and over-produced but I'm not sure how much that could have been avoided. It's not a crime for Indy 5 to be found guilty of, it's just a little disappointing.I get the impulse to just rail against the final product here. I'm coming at this as a die-hard Indy fan, Raiders is still my favourite movie of all time. Does Dial of Destiny recapture the old magic? I'd argue that it does in moments but I don't know if anyone ever will replicate that entire elixir again. The action is solid, there are some good performances and I think it still hits the mark more than it doesn't. It's way better than Crystal Skull (you can decide how impressive of a complement that is) and while I acknowledge that Dial feels a little less enchanting, I still enjoyed myself. As long as expectations are kept low, it's worth checking out in theatres. It's a decent last ride for Indiana and a better send off than what had been fated to the character in the previous entry.","

And I found this film to be just okay...its not the disaster everyone is making it out to be...but its also not a super great film like some others are saying...its just right in the middle of just being okay.Harrison Ford as Indy is what you want. Nothing more needs to be said. Even at 80 he is still Indy.Morgan- Phoebe Waller.....shes been a constant complaint from everyone...and I tend to agree. She was definitely very off putting in the film. She had her moments but for the most part I found her incredibly distracting and over the top with her acting.Mads Mikkelson....he rules and thats all I need to say. The dude doesnt miss in his roles. Even though I wish he was a little more menacing in the film...I dont think they really showed how evil of a villain he can be...so I think that was a miss there.I couldve done without the Short Round replacement. I feel like that character offered nothing to the film and was pointless.The storyline I thought was fine for an Indiana Jones film in 2023.Overall its not a horrible film...its definitely better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull...and id say almost better than Temple of Doom(I know im in the minority with that film...)But thats about it...it was just okay.","

"bizzyziggy","1 July 2023","In 1981 I went to a sneak preview of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I saw it several more times at the theater, even staying and watching it again in the same day. I encouraged family and friends to see it. I bought the soundtrack on LP, later CD. I bought the movie on VHS, DVD and currently 4k.This is not my Indiana Jones.The story writing is bad. The direction is awful. Mangold is an overrated director who will never deserve the status of the great directors of yesteryear. And shame on Mangold for repeated lying to the fans about re-shoots and other things that came out of his mouth.Who would think that anything would make me want to increase my rating and rewatch Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This movie does, just as Disney's Star Wars stab elevated the prequel trilogy for everyone.How they dismissed the character of the son Mutt Williams in this movie was yet more poor writing and undeserved.Who would think that Helena would make me appreciate. Willie Scott, a character I despised. Helena does many nonredeemable actions, but is never called on it.Ridiculous thin mustached Teddy is no Short Round. I also have a problem with the teenage character directly involved with the death of a villain, even if he was a Nazi. It just didn't seem right.The whole section in the past, Syracuse, Sicily, just seemed out of place and Dr. Who goofiness.The villain and his number one henchmen don't get the personal Indiana Jones touch that others received in the past. It was like, boom, crash. That's it.It also quite obvious where the original movie ending was heading. I can see it now. Indy in the past and some future artifact found showing what happened to him. Yawn. I would be interested in what some of the unfortunate who saw the original ending have to say. Instead, we get an abrupt ending in the past and the new re-shot story-tale ending unfold.Yes, we get Marion. Which fans always wanted, and it appears she was not in it originally, and also dismissed as another poor writing plot point. I was very happy to see her. And the filmmakers get credit for this last five minute, because it is a feel good moment that viewers are going to resonate with instead of the last 2+ hours.For your sake, pass this by. Oh, and I wasn't paid for this negative review. I actually lost money for the ticket, popcorn and drink.","

"nincubura","31 August 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is proper movie making, particularly for those of us born before the iPhone, who saw the original in theaters. After the first and third installments, this is the best.Seeing a well plotted and competently directed movie is wonderfully refreshing, after more than a decade of comic book and video game movies. But sadly, this edition of the franchise did not do well at the box office, since it seems that the new generation of moviegoers must be rather A. D. D. And require continuous in-your-face grotesque hyper-stimulation. As in the history classes of Professor Jones, such moviegoers are most likely clueless to what is a Trireme, why it is called that, and what was its significance. Likewise, with the historic significance of the real Antikythera mechanism, let alone Archimedes inception of integral calculus and specific gravity - the most significant mathematical progress after use of the number zero in India, 400 years earlier.There are countless tie-ins and references to the prior editions of the franchise, and the formula is effectuated with excellence. Further, this is based upon a real archeological artifact, which has not been previouisly explored in movie or TV fiction (that I know of) -- and the concept relating back to the first and third movies was absolute genius!Further, this movie omitted most of the absurd stereotyping of characters and cultures in the prior movies. The number of A-list performers was wonderful to see, and their performances did not disappoint.","

"ericknromero","2 July 2023","I give it a 6 out of 10. Let me get the crud out of the way first so I can finish with the good stuff (spoiler free, don't worry).It feels like an imitation of an Indiana Jones movie rather than an Indiana Jones movie. As if someone was told what the character and films were about, described some of their favorite scenes from the earlier versions, and then had ChatGPT come up with a movie. What was created was an approximation. So you get similar, but not the same, stunts and jokes and treasures and chases and blending-in-to-hide moves and lucky-to-be-alive moments. They're just not as good, and certainly not as original.Some of the CGI isn't good enough, de-aging technology had mixed results, and, to me, the chase scenes through towns are kind of cringe. Through it all you're thinking ""There's no way a man in his 70s is doing all of that."" They throw in a couple of appearances from familiar characters, just so you can point at the screen and yell ""I know that person! They're from the other thing!""I suppose it's the execution that bothered me the most, then. This is a little surprising because I consider James Mangold a good director with an excellent track record when it comes to executing compex film ideas (or even simple ones). This is where I'll transition to what I liked about the Dial of Destiny.Story is super solid, Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones (no matter what age or movie), some of the character interactions appear genuine and moving, Mads Mikkelsen has never been anything short of magnificent in any of his roles, Phoebe Waller-Bridge is really good when the script let's her be, and that ending is one of the best endings I've seen in an Indy film. This may be a movie with a high level of rewatchability built in, so my change my mind in the future.Though a little too wacky for my taste, there is lots of comedy, action, and adventure. Having Ford reprise the title role one last time gives it a sense of believability, even when things pop off in a ridiculous way. Once again, that last part of the movie is made real for us because of how Indiana Jones reacts to it. And his interactions with his family/friends make it touching in just the right amount.Personally, I love the history aspect of these movies. In this one they get into topics like Syracuse and Archimedes from Ancient times, the 1969 moon landing and what American culture was like then, and, as per the usual, what those Nazis were up to during WW2. The clues and hunting and passageways with mystery around the corner, that's classic Indiana Jones and that's definitely here.I will say the trailer is misleading. Jones hasn't been looking for the Dial for all of his life. They make that abundantly clear in the beginning of the movie. He is looking for something else, maybe something he can't have... or maybe he can.","

"zenmilos","2 July 2023","We got the continuation, in this case I really hope the final one, of the franchise that amused us in the 80's of the last century. Like everything that modern Hollywood, and most of all Disney, has touched in this century, only confirms that all we can expect is that everything new will only be worse than the previous one. Of course, no one still thinks of investing in original stories and some new heroes, it is enough to grab a few more dollars on nostalgia for some better, past times.Hand on heart, it should be said that the beginning of the first 15 minutes of the movie is somewhat reminiscent of the original sequels. Unfortunately, then the ""real"" Indian Jones appears, who represents everything so-called-feminist Hollywood considers a modern female character - an unsympathetic, arrogant person without any character, who never needs any help, with a solution for every situation, without even any trace of humor or sex appeal, with such acting skills that she can't even serve as ""comic relief"" in any movie.Averagely directed, without any meaningful plot, with characters and villains that appear without any logic every time we should expect it. The scenes of time travel and the siege of Syracuse 212-211 BCE I don't know what could be compared to, except with the worst episodes of the Doctor Who series. It's a good thing that the screenwriters didn't think of including, in the already unoriginal and non-imaginitive story, for eg. Parallel universes, although, allegedly, in the original version, Indiana Jones was supposed to be replaced by a female counterpart, but after test screenings, the ending was reshot and changed.The recommendation is, of course, that if you can at all, skip this movie, which according to reports has already failed miserably at the box office. If you watch it anyway, at least the hated 4th sequel will seem like a perfectly acceptable achievement after this misdeed.","

"petrxpp","5 July 2023","Harrison Ford is really trying his best, but he's left for this alone. In fact him tripping over almost everything around. The fifth Indy is visually unattractive and in some moments regularly repulsive, but mostly it has a boring story full of boring characters and especially the villains are a bunch of uninteresting idiots who are not scary at all. Mads Mikkelsen looks like he's about to cry the whole time. Mangold directs it all without striving for invention, and the result is, at best, a passable craft somewhere on the level of two, Treasure Hunters and a little bit above Uncharted, which is certainly not praise. It lacks the style, imagination and obvious joy that accompanied the first three and partly even the fourth part. Film without a soul.","

"kgprophet","1 July 2023","Modern filmmaking has learned by trial and error what makes a film that satisfies an audience. ""Ironman"" and the ""Force Awakens"" are good examples. Pacing, tone, and just the right amount of humour are some of the aspects of the formula that makes a good film. We can see the results of applying the formula to ""Tog Gun"", making for one of the most popular movies in recent times. It is interpreted by the public that the primary reason for making yet another Indiana Jones is to make up for the mostly negative reception of the 4th film.This is made evident in the excellent opening sequence that goes back to WWII and takes place on a moving train. Unfortunately no other action sequences in the film match that opening sequence. Another thing that will cause a reaction by audiences is the CGI effects to make Harrison Ford younger for that opening sequence. For one, it is still Harrison's 80 year old grandpa voice in this twenty-something version of him. The gratuitous effects throughout the film, along with this version of Ford where his face looks painted, gives this whole film a graphic novel vibe. Not a bad thing.So is the old magic still there? I feel Spielberg and Lucas touches as executive producers, probably tossing in additional gags or finding ways to amp up the tension. I think all will agree that one thing missing is more humour. Things get serious early in the film when innocent side characters are needlessly shot dead in cold blood. Yes, it makes the villains truly bad guys, but it just sets a more somber tone to the film. What about Shia laBeouf? He is replaced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who starred in the stunning ""Fleabag"" TV show. However, her character seems to be a one note piece of cardboard. She shows that she has a couple things up her sleeve later in the film, but she doesn't sell it very well. Compare the engaging version of Catwoman played Anne Hathaway in ""Dark Knight Rises"". Her character showed more heart in justifying her life. Then there is the new version of ""Short Round"". As well as he is as a child actor, his involvement seemed merely perfunctory. Then there is Mads Mikkelsen as the main antagonist. A former Nazi, he worked for the United States rocket program. He fills the role well, but subtract a point for other side characters that are not very engaging.Most of the film takes place in 1969, and involves the ticker tape parade given to the astronauts in New York City. Then it's off to other exotic locations like a typical Bond or Mission: Impossible film. Audiences will probably take note of the amount of CGI effects compared to the other films. Although there are sequences that have some bona fide stunts, even they have obvious background replacement. So yes, that detracts from the film.As I mentioned, pacing has been refined these days that keep the story rolling along. Not so with IJATDOD. At the end of the second act, things settle down with some extended dialogue sequences. If it is meant to add some character development or advance the story, there must have been a better way to do it. Because (drum roll please) it breaks the two hour rule! The extra half-hour overstays the audience's welcome. They want the Indiana Jones experience, but not when it drags the ending out like this. One would think Spielberg would have had the sensitivity if he was crafting this film to find the slow spots and figure out how to keep up the proper crackerjack movie type of pacing. So, subtract a point for going into extra innings.As a whole, there is enough Indiana Jones nostalgia for those who have those expectations. The story however is elongated unnecessarily, giving us periods of slow dialogue and unsuccessful attempts at character development. The very best element of this film that almost saves it is the rollicking score by the master composer John Williams. It elevates the film more than anything else. 6 out of 10.","

"hector-61488","26 November 2023","This.. movie had potential to live up to all any Indiana Jones fan wouldve expected actually. But just.. the effects like the car-chase and all are done so badly they are almost laughable, early 1960s sort of scenes, such such bad editing, bad camera angles on action shots... it really broke up and cheapened the movie up to a disturbing degree for me.I'm not expecting grade-A CGI shots... but cmon..Its almost like the first hour of the movie is good and then they ran out of patience.So thats one point lost.The second point lost is the sheer and utter bad acting from Phoebe, which when u start noticing how bad she is... (not to mention Teddy..) ..a voice starts screaming in my head 'why on earth was she cast for this!'. She has no charisma with just as much acting talent as any average human being... there is zero chemistry between the two main roles. Why did they not cast a better lead for her role is beyond me... what a waste of a budget there.I was so pleased to see the one true female side-kick, Marion, even if just for a few seconds.Which is a shame because the story was actually better than the previous attempt, and brings back a lot more lost ark vibes and easy viewing. The momentum is fine. The script is fine. All the worldly adventures fine. Classic villains. All fall in line with the original Indiana stuff.. couldve been an 8.Alas.","

"MJB784","2 July 2023","Good news: I enjoyed Indiana Jones 5. It was entertaining with good action scenes and humor. The story was well written, too. Indy is trying to find the other half of a teleportation device after his previous partner split it apart so Nazis wouldn't find it. The device was created by Archemedies in ancient times and looks like a giant, rusty compass. Bad news: It went on too long. Some of it dragged. The partners weren't as interesting as Miriam or Willie Scott or Short Round; except the first partner in the opening 25 minutes. The opening was the best part of the movie and really felt like the early classics. So, it's my third favorite of the series. First and second still the best.","

And i am not a fan of Disney or paid by anyone to say it.I read i do not know how many comments about a very dull movie, with a stupid story, and i was surprised to enjoy the movie.It is a nice movie, well crafted, who retake the origin.And a very good ending for the saga.If you are looking for a fun family movie with dark moments you will be well served.That is crazy because after 45 minutes i said to myself ""indy is back""
I do not understand this stupid wave of haters about this movie.","

"tchitouniaram","29 December 2023","Reasonably entertaining , hence the 6 stars ... To begin with , I never was a big fan of Indiana Jones movies , but somewhat simply enjoyed watching them for decent action and a very good sense of humor amid great supporting actors ... This film seems to follow in the footsteps of the previous ones , but feels kind of deflated and forced ... Like with a lot of other films now , made by famous directors with famous actors and great stories , this film's biggest mistake , it's a simple truth : humans don't get better with old age , like wine ))) unfortunately , the geriatric elite of Hollywood , just doesn't know when it's a proper time to quit ... Nevertheless , sad but not too bad one time watch .","

"askeland89","30 June 2023","... And it lived up to my expecations. Pretty much the same as Crystal Skull. Indiana Jones doesn't work anymore. The original trilogy will be remembered, this one will be forgotten. I have seen all I need to see from Harrison Ford, be a good old man and retire like Jack Nicholson before you... And while you're at it, take Arnie, Sly and Clint Eastwood with you... The only tolerable part of this pathetic excuse of a movie was the music and the visuals. Boring story, boring characters and overall just boring... Granted I laughed a few times but for the wrong reasons.. My girlfriend seemed to enjoy it but I have no idea why.Not impressed for a second. Some of you might enjoy it and I admire you for it, wish I was that clueless.. I truly do.","

"siderite","31 August 2023","The idea of the first Indiana Jones movie was ridiculous, but the action, Ford's charisma and the limited options of 1981 made it great. 40 years later, a similarly ridiculous idea is still fun with plenty of action, Ford's charisma and the limited options of 2023.One of the most impressive things in the film is the beginning, where an almost seamless Indiana Jones deaging has him fight Nazis on top of moving trains amid allied bombings. Except that unlike many films before, it was not uncanny or pathetic, it was really really good. I was feeling like they somehow had stock footage from the '80s.Then there is the character of Phoebe Bridge, who is not that bad, even though pretty inconsistent. She reads as a woman with daddy issues who hasn't yet decided what kind of person she is going to be. There are no out of place jokes and she plays it all as a serious character.The other things, actors brought from the past, the child that kind of helps, but also annoys, the last Nazi gasp (considering the action of the movie is somewhere in 1970), the horse through subway routine... they were OK. I didn't feel upset by any of it.Bottom line: a fine sendoff, a lot better then the fourth entry in the series which I hope gets forgotten and almost on par with the originals.P. S. Yeah, a lot of things don't make sense, but go with it. They never did make any sense.","

"LisaLR1","16 July 2023","Recently saw the new Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Bit of a let down, although I enjoyed the bit players in the movie, Toby Jones, Mads Mikkelsen, John Rhys-Davies and fun cameo by Karen Allen. Felt the film's script was a little cheesy, too many chase scenes, movie is overly reliant on CGI and the de-aging of Harrison Ford, I felt, was distracting and didn't do the movie justice. My favorite film of the Indiana Jones franchise is still Raiders of the Lost Ark. Nothing beats the original. Dial of Destiny lacks the magic and heroics of the first film, but it does provide entertainment and a solid supporting cast.","

"musicista-38011","29 October 2023","I had high hopes for this one, despite the geriatric state of my beloved main actor, but -alas!- I was quite disappointed.I shan't spoil anything, so all I say is that there are plot holes IMHO (is this news anyway?) and the choice of cast could have been wiser. By this I mean the female lead role, which I didn't manage to like despite my best efforts.If you are looking for some not-too-bad entertainment, this movie might be for you, after all it contains all the right tropes, more or less.The ending managed to be more entertaining (to me) than the rest of the movie, to be fully honest.Kudos to Harrison Ford for saving all that was salvageable in the movie, and of course to John Williams, without whose music many movies would have flopped royally.","

"tylerharris-96526","6 July 2023","Go see Asteroid City, Indiana Jones 5 is definitely not worth your timeI dont know where to start
Even without the bad cgi, shoehorned-in poorly acted sidekicks, disjointed boring plot and strangely minimal (mostly absent) performance from Mads, this is the worst Indiana Jones movieThe long intro with cartoon young Harrison Ford is briefly intriguing but really shows that they should have either replaced Harrison Ford by now or spun off into a different tomb-raiding franchiseHe's simply too old to pull off any of this action
I tried suspending my disbelief, but his line delivery was dull, the writing itself was dull, the story and characters were flat and dull, and with so little substance to engage with, I was forced to study his performance for 2 hoursEven the science fiction 'twist' at the end was mild, pointless and stupid. I would call it hamfisted but that would make it sound more interesting than it was. Contrived and meaningless just like the rest of this dead fish- LAME.If you're still considering seeing this, don't. It was vapid, boring, dumb and annoying.","

"coleektorrd","30 August 2023","I think Phoebe is an outstanding choice to co-star with the Harrison Ford. I didn't find her annoying at all. She acted the way any goddaughter would act. It was a wonderful Adventure. And in case anybody didn't notice, they will be a sixth or 7th and 8th and 9th Etc as long as it makes money. Why? CGI baby! It's so realistic now! They can make stories up for whatever age Indy happened to be at the time.If Harrison Ford chose to for the sake of his offspring and family, he can sign off on his image being used indefinitely for the characters as long as somebody is there to benefit from the gross sales.Long Live Indiana Jones movies starring Harrison Ford. Or his ghost.","

"malcolmwrites","3 July 2023","I'll make this quick, and I'll put it in bullet-point form for the sake of convenience.(By the way, I'm the ultimate Indiana Jones fan. If you don't believe it, just ask me.) :)The Bad Stuff:1. Terrible subtitle for the movie. Before this, we had ""Raiders,"" ""Doom,"" Crusade,"" and even ""Skulls."" (Ugh.) ""Dial of Destiny"" isn't exciting. It's not sexy. It's a laundry detergent ad..maybe.2. Too many epic actions sequences. Spielberg knew how to space these out. There's a rhythm and flow to good pacing. Any one of these actions scenes would have been fine on its own. But all together...it's too much. Indy needs to stop and breathe. Have a tea with Sallah. Fall asleep on a boat with Marion. Insult your host over dinner at Pankot Palace. Have a drink on a blimp with your dad.3. The underwater scene. Indy is a classroom guy. He's a desert guy. He's even a jungle guy. Everything he is gets drowned underwater.4. Not enough Marion. (Is there even such a thing as too much Marion?) If the producers want to use their time dial thingy for anything, it should be to flash back to the writers' room and have someone put up a hand and say, ""If this is going to be Indy's send-off, it HAS to be him and Marion together all the way!""The Good Stuff:1. It's still Indy. Mangold and the writers preserved the essence of his character and all the best things about him. The grumpiness. The reckless bravery. The nobility. The fear. The passion. The eternally loyal fedora. It's all there like it's supposed to be.2. Phone Waller-Bridge. Of course there's going to be some hate out there. She's a snarky Brit, after all. But her character is smart, clever, charismatic, articulate, devious, funny, brave, and her story arc parallels Indy's own arc in Temple of Doom. (Going from capitalistic ""fortune and glory"" to ""I know it's worth now"" when he comes back to the village with the Shankar Stones.) So everyone please just chill on her. She's no Marion, but she's not supposed to be. And she's a bazillion times better than Willie or Elsa.3. The Morocco scenes. The colors, the backdrop, the ambiance, the crazy chase...all 100% Indy.4. The de-aging CGI. Okay, so they obscured it with some clever angles and dark lighting. But it wasn't bad. Nothing screamed Uncanny Valley, and we could enjoy classic Indy without being forced into cringy laughter at the technology. (At this rate, they'll be able to make a full movie with a totally believable thirty-five year old Indy. The line to see that starts behind me.)5. Speaking of aging...good on everyone involved for leaning into Indy's age. Every groan, complaint, quip, and word of wisdom...it's all totally Indy. Sallah and Marion, too.Final result? Everyone's into ranking the five films, so here's my take:1. Raiders. (Of course.)2. Crusade. (Nearly a no-brainer for second place)3. Temple of Doom AND Dial of Destiny are tied for third. Either of them works equally well as an imperfect but fun bit of Saturday afternoon escapism.Skulls isn't allowed in my house.Final bit of advice from one Indy fan to another:Relax. Don't overthink it. Before anything else, Indy is supposed to be a thrill-a-minute joyride. This one may have its bumps, but it's still what it's supposed to be, and it takes us along for the ride as promised.","

"Marvo2369","3 July 2023","Well let's start off with the negatives and work from there.The film does lack something that the original films were famous for, and that was a fear factor. Whether it was the deadly traps in the temples, or the horrifying and gruesome deaths in the action sequences, Indiana Jones was famous for its shocking imagery and it's scary suspenseful intense scenes. This film doesn't have any of that, but that's to be expected for a Disney film. It's heavily died down for the younger audience, which let's face it, kids aren't gonna watch a sequel to a franchise as old as this. But that's a problem with Disney, nothing to do with this film or the quality of it. Instead of servicing the fan base that was around for these films, they decide to try and make it appealing for their new audiences which to me doesn't make sense at all. But it was fine, just very 'Disneyfied' in terms of everything visual etc. It had that very generic Disney look, for example the underwater scene with the skeletons just looked like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean. But again, I can look past this.The other gripe are the action sequences. Once again, the trailer has shown you anything and everything that was interesting in this film. It revealed all the action scenes to you and left nothing to the surprise in theatres. So basically all the action you see in the trailer is all you get. The rest is just story progression. Also, this film could have offered so much more in terms of variety in action other than the same generic chase sequences that ran throughout. That's right - every action sequence was pretty much just a car bike or train chase. Nothing else much happened really. So the action was nothing compared to the first few films. The other issue with the action is Indy doesn't really do much, and of course, that's because he can't. As old as Harrison Ford is, he's very limited to what he can do. And instead of the charming action we got in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, in this we just got him throwing a few weak punches, getting thrown down and pulling away in fear from a gun. So he doesn't offer much, and he physically can't. So the issue there for me is, he was too old for this type of movie. However, if you can set all that aside for a great story and interesting new adventure, then you're in for a treat.Because besides the generic action and lack of physical movement from Indy, what we do have is an array of fun and engaging characters who all play their parts really well in a captivating classic Indiana Jones adventure. If you're an Indiana Jones fan, you'll totally get into this movie (even if it feels over the top ridiculous, which an Indiana Jones movie is supposed to be). It has that same charm and humour to it as the others and delivers a new and exciting (and interestingly clever) concept, and delivers beautiful nostalgia throughout. The film looks beautiful visually in places and you can tell the filmmakers loved making this movie. The work they put into this has paid off. The imagery throughout is masterful and offers some classic Indiana moments. The ending is beautiful and serves Indy justice in the end.The overall story is meaningful and worthwhile, and for me delivers on everything important to Indy's legacy. You can tell the director took a lot of care with this film and made the script work to its favour and served me as a fan of the franchise well. The director took the past movies into consideration and used their history to craft this film well and for me it honestly paid off. Also, Phoebes character is not really that irritating and I found blended well into the story. Honestly, she integrated like any of the other female characters in the other films. And the dynamic between her and Indy worked well.Overall, I almost missed this film because of the reviews. But I'm so glad I didn't. If you're an original Indiana Jones fan, you're gonna enjoy it. It's not the best entry, but it certainly is the last and a decent one at that. It's honestly worth the watch and I thoroughly enjoyed those 2 and a half hours. They flew by.Give it a go. It's like marmite. You either love it, or you hate it. But boy I love it.","

"FKDZ","26 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a okay addition and end to the franchise but it certainly wasn't needed nor added anything worthwhile. Whilst I didn't hate it the movie also didn't leave me with anything to reminisce about. It surprisingly focused on being somewhat sad and sentimental. The way to go out should've been Indy's biggest adventure yet, with history, caves, tombs and mystery. Not running thorough a parade and driving a tuk tuk.Directorially it doesn't really do anything. Some scenes are nice and there's glimpses of nice moments. But action scenes are messy, mainly due to the elephant in the room: having and old man fight. It either makes for comically easy enemies, or very chaotic scenes where you are intentionally disoriented.The de-aged section of the movie. I liked it a lot and it felt like a great start of the movie. The CGI de-aging for me was very noticeable though, there's this distinct softness to his young face that just doesn't sell it to me. It's not uncanny, but it's noticeable.Story and characters. I think the side characters are fine. If Helena (Waller-Bridge) had more to work with than what we got it might've been better. I'm happy they didn't try to replace Indy like in crystal skull. The levity the Helena character brought was a warm welcome to the depressing storyline they attached to Indy. Imo this feels like a weird direction for Indy to go. Compared to the first three movies I just don't see how he became what he is in the movie, it's far fetched, they try to explain it but it doesn't work for me. The story tends to drag a little but is split with some decent action scenes. But when Ford is having to be the action hero, it just becomes a bit of a parody simply because Ford has gotten really old, and it's emphasized in the movie. And counter that with comically inept villains and well.. it borders on comedy, tension is lost. I did however love the story element at the end. But that was needed so much sooner, that's where the movie should've been all this time. The ultimate Indy finale. Living history.Special shoutout to the worst most uninteresting side character Teddy. Seriously could not have been written to be more boring. Made me miss shortround. Even Willie.. The way it handled some side characters like Renaldo was a bit odd.Acting, everybody is kind of there. I was most disappointed with Mikkelsen, just not memorable. Indy villains tend to be fairly memorable but not so much here. Very generic.Music, the Indy theme is there and effective. Not much else.All in all it's a okay end to the franchise (until they reboot it). But I felt like this should've been the biggest adventure with the most amount of history and exploration. But sadly not.","

"namob-43673","30 June 2023","There are four really bad things about this movie. First of Phoebe Waller-Bridge who should not be acting, and especially not in any high budget movies. The disrespect of the character of Indiana Jones and the franchise which is a big annoyance throughout except perhaps the first 15min. Third the editing which is very strange, and almost ruins the movie. But the fourth problem is the big one; and that is how boring this movie is.If they had replaced Phoebe, or used the CIA agent played by Shaunette Renée Wilson instead that would have solved so much. The writing is very condescending, almost hateful towards Indiana. Clearly written for the amusement of Darth Kennedy. But this too could have easily been solved. And if they had solved those two issues and rewritten the storyline just a tiny bit so to make it less boring, this would actually not be a bad movie. Might have even been a great one.A few tiny other issues with the CGI, some scenes that does not make any sense and a few side characters that feels forced into the movie. But overall the four big problems mention above is the issue.Everything else is pretty good. Music score is great, costumes, set pieces are all good. Cinematography (except for editing and CGi) is excellent. The acting, with Phoebe as the shining bad exception, is also excellent.But, as mention this is as boring as watching paint dry on a golf-course. All the other stuff can almost be forgiven, but when you are watching your phone, thinking of what to have for dinner, and contemplating going out to get vodka to better enjoy the movie, well then you have a failed movie. A boring, failed movie. This is Indiana Jones, how can it be boring? But it is.I cannot really say this is a horrible movie, because it isn't. I have seen a lot worse, even this week I have seen worse. But this cannot be watched without a pillow to sleep on and it cannot be recommended by anyone who like qualitative movies. I give this a very generous 4/10 because its not bad-bad and because everything else but the 4 points above has pretty high quality. But if you like the character of Dr Jones, you cannot watch this. Be warned.","

"gabethedinosaur","30 June 2023","After 24 years since I was a kid I remember watching Indiana Jones on vhs when I was about 4 years old. Raiders of the lost ark really impacted my childhood. The ark ghost gave me nightmares for days . Temple of doom was absolutely one of my favorite childhood movies . Last crusade with the holy grail and Indy's dad was like a combination of father joins the son and goes after the holy grail before the German nazies find it first. The Crystal skull ohh that one was absolutely one of the best movies I ever saw 15 years ago when I was 12 years old before I was 13 . The dial of destiny was I say by far the most remarkable final chapters of Indy's last adventure. Seeing Salah since raiders of the lost ark , and the last crusade really made Indiana Jones a better story . The beginning part of Indy taking place during the end of ww2 was the perfect plot . Indy fights the nazies one last time after Hitler killed himself was by far the best part of the film . Seeing young Harrison ford was really incredible. 1969 the start of Apollo 11 landing on the moon was the perfect way to show Indy seeing the world changing after the beginning of ww1 Great Depression 1929 to the 1930s which included his adventures during 1935 the eye of Mara , temple of doom , 1936 the ark , 1938 the holy grail and the start of ww2 , 1944 the end of the war , 1957 the Cold War and the Crystal skull aka alien skull , and 1969 the Vietnam war and the Apollo moon landing and time travel . The nazies traveling to the era of bc was by far a crazy mistake. They tried to travel to the 1939 during the start of ww2 but it was the wrong era and the villains got they're final death wish . And Indy seeing Marion after mutt died during the Vietnam war made them finally come back together and share their love . Indy thank you for doing one last adventure and Harrison ford congratulations on finally doing the last chapter of Indiana Jones.And all the credit goes to George Lucas Steven Spielberg and James mangold for directing Indiana Jones and Kathy for producing Indy .Thank you Lucasfilm Ltd and Disney.","

While I enjoyed the overall adventure, I couldn't warm up to the character Helena. The film's focus on Greece was exciting in concept, but the execution fell short. The Greek references felt off, and the portrayal of the city didn't capture the essence of a Greek landscape. Additionally, the movie's length and pacing made it feel a bit flat, lacking the excitement I expected, especially for a finale. It was an okay watch, but far from the impressive conclusion I had hoped for.""It was a nice watch but could be better.","

"lesunra","8 July 2023","It's everywhere in entertainment now and it's irredeemably cheap in terms of storytelling and its underlining mission; tearing down the past to remake it into something it never was to 1. Apologize for it. 2. Try to change it to suit modern nonsense, I mean sensibilities, 3. Cash in, of course. The flaw in this action every time is the people most responsible for these newer movies DID NOT INVENT THE ORIGINAL PREMISE. If you do not create it, do you care about it? Do you respect it? Does it mean anything to you besides just another job? Certainly not, at least not compared to something you created yourself.What's here is the identical formula we've seen in Star Wars sequels, that Obi-Wan mini series and unrelated to Disney, Doctor Who. A discrediting of established characters, ignorance of their past and motivations (Indiana Jones the grave robber??? Accused of that by a female Beloc clone that we're supposed to like even idolize as the hero? Jones was all about putting those things in museums so that the ACTUAL grave robbers didn't take them for profit! They were coming for those relics anyway.)Like the two other Disney products I mentioned, the established heroes are presented as weak, inferior broken down shadows of their former selves. The reasons are different in each case but that's the formula. A younger bland super human by comparison, (typically a woman) swoops in saves the day for these broken down old white men and everyone still breathing lives happily ever after. That seems like the mission statement that is now costing these companies millions because audiences don't like their established heroes being portrayed as weak, inferior broken down old white men. Even if they are old white men, give them SOME dignity at least afterall, Indiana Jones IS the title character, not Fleabag and her sidekick afterbirth or something.Generally, that's the formula but I've read that the initially planned ending for this was going to be Indiana Jones time traveling back, dying, and Helena being the real one on those adventures in the earlier movies in the series. Chibnall basically did as much to Doctor Who. The fan revolt was real enough to cause a major shakeup in an attempt to keep that series afloat.People hated Crystal Skull for various reasons, personally I hated the CGI the most. Those bugs, the vines, the monkeys, the aliens. All of the locations look fake. Filming might've been entirely studio bound with CGI backdrops. CGI is no better in this movie. It's worse if you consider how technology was meant to advance over 15 years time. Over reliance on CGI is always a mistake and they make that mistake constantly. CGI doesn't seem to save money either so why not give it up for a change?The overlong chase scenes lead to desensitization regarding them and that makes them boring instead of exciting and I mean really really boring. That's something good filmmakers understood to avoid years ago. Maybe if they had a thin script like this that lacks some major elements in storytelling, they wouldn't do any better and wind up falling back on chase scenes as filler. Maybe that's why this Indiana Jones movie is a half hour longer than all the others but feels like it has half the story they had. Yes, that makes for a boring movie. You're supposed to not notice how boring because of the visuals and sound serving to jar you awake instead of keeping you engaged in the plot. Have I mentioned yet how cheap that is in terms of storytelling? Let me restate that.Main characters must first be likable and their adversaries interesting. Mads Mikkelsen barely manages the interesting part (its nothing particulary new for him to do acting wise and that makes his role here cliché) but there is nothing likable about the real star of this movie, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. When she isn't cringe trying to deliver a joke, she's a 20 something snob who looks down on everyone who in reality would know far more than her if only because they have more experience than she does. In Raiders of the Lost Ark they established Indiana Jones right in the first act as an experienced adventurer who also is a knowledgeable professor, not as someone with a pasty face a few years removed from college. Her having this fount of knowledge that dwarfs everyone else is more fake than time travel.In Helena, we see the most frustrating thing about this movie because of the missed opportunity her character represents. There is several ways someone can be a hero. Indiana Jones from the start is a sad, embittered, broken old man; instead of this new character introduced into the series helping him find his sense of purpose again (that can be a form of heroic action btw) as they both go on this quest, Helena never does it and Jones ends up much the way he began but with a happy ending that isn't very believable nor does he seem to deserve because the hero's journey never happened for him. He is basically the same when it's over. His story arc is flat as a board, Helena's story arc is flat as a board. She already knows and does everything. There is no growth anywhere for anyone. She barely manages a level of tolerance for the title character and that's it. Remember Last Crusade? Indiana Jones had no relationship with his father at the start, not too interested in where he was living, nor what he was doing until he is told his father is missing; it ends with a common understanding between them as they are united in ways they never were before. Does a journey like that happen in Dial of Destiny? NO. Even Crystal Skull didn't make Dial of Destiny's mistake of ignoring the monomyth which certainly makes Crystal Skull a better movie despite the CGI. At the start of Crystal Skull, all the main characters are in one stage of their lives and their lives dramatically change over the course of the story and are completely different by the conclusion of the quest. Does this happen in Dial of Destiny? NO. I'd give Crystal Skull 4/10 which means it's bad but it at least showed characters growing as the story leads to a resolution. Which character learned anything major about themselves when this thing ends?Time travel is no more ridiculous than aliens but not a better idea than them either. You'd think since this was set during the height of the cold war and space race and arms race and all that, Soviets would be the logical adversaries again like in Crystal Skull and not random Nazis who couldn't have the resources on hand (even with covert help) to try and acquire such a thing certainly not compared to a superpower's direct involvement. That's not believable.The fan service is horrible pandering which is just trying to make something indigestible digestible. Clearly this is the least successful movie of the series so audiences aren't content with these little condescending nods to the past anymore. Pandering didn't make Jaws 4 into a better movie, did it?The suspension of disbelief is stretched further than seeing that guy's face melt in Raiders or that other guy aging to death in seconds after drinking a sip of water in Last Crusade. At least something unexplainable causes that. The suspension of disbelief here is simply plot holes and violations of basic physics that do not have some supernatural power making it seem possible. First noticed near the end of the de-aged Indy opening. How the Nazi chasing him doesn't become decapitated on the top of the train moving that fast is beyond reason or logic. The sound of the impact was too loud to be anything other than a beheading but no? Also beyond reason or logic is how a woman weighing no more than 130 lbs can hang on to a plane traveling 250 mph with a 200 lb man hanging on to her. There was nothing supernatural preventing her from being blown out of there immediately even without the guy clinging to her, and yet.... There's also examples of villains seemingly warping into locations, or being conveniently dumb to further the plot. I haven't gotten to some teenage boy magically figuring out how to fly a plane almost immediately yet. Such things can be excused a few times but an entire movie? Come on now. Do better, please.....People wanting to like this will labor to make it seem good in their minds; the people who don't will correctly think they shouldn't have to make an effort to like something that is supposed to be entertaining in its own right.I continue to wait for the day when these franchises created by others years ago are left alone and the allegedly brilliant people coming up with new garbage like this start creating THEIR OWN NEW FRANCHISES! SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT!!Friendly Reminder, if you never subject yourselves to forays into the destruction of cinematic heroes, they're not canon TO YOU. If you prefer thinking this ends in '38 with riding off into the sunset, you'd be better off for it. Not everything needs to be viewed through the scope of studio greed. You can easily imagine better content than they provide. THAT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO DO, TRUST ME.","

"RocketeerFlyer","5 September 2023","Most Indy Fans will ENJOY this.It seems some have a REAL HATE for this fifth outing for Indiana Jones.I just don't get it?I've read what some have to say about it, but REALLY a score of 1? Insulting.One such reviewer even mentioned they rather enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so of a young looking (AI) version of Indy & yet they still gave it a ONE!I agree with them & others in saying how amazingly good (almost perfect) this younger (AI) version of Indiana was here & the ACTION seen here is about as GOOD as it's GETS in this particular film, although I enjoyed the ENDING too & whilst none of the Action Set Pieces could MATCH anything in RAIDERS or The LAST CRUSADE I did enjoy them.BUT A ONE!!!I'm not sure quiet what they expected?With Harrison Ford heading upwards of 80 Years of age now, it was clear that he was going to show his age in this film & didn't he just, I GET that some thought he should have HUNG HIS HAT UP ;) at the end of his last adventure (some 15 years or so ago) but that said, I'm fine they made it, I'm fine we saw an older, retiring Indy (which of course Harrison is now doing with this character)I READ a LOT of negative words concerning this film upon release & that may have influenced it's BOX-OFFICE but I enjoyed it.The SCRIPT isn't the BEST...I agree, it certainly hasn't got the snap & crackle of RAIDERS (THE BEST in the series by far) OR even THE LAST CRUSADE (for which we should THANK Steven Spielberg for returning him back to another RAIDERS like outing & which is a very close
2nd BEST in the series) but after those two...Is this SCRIPT here a great deal worse than 'The Temple of Doom' or 'The Crystal Skull'?Not really, I don't think so, it's about on a par with them in terms of writing.Indiana Jones films clearly WORK WELL with better scripts & stories (as per 'RAIDERS' & 'The LAST CRUSADE') it's TRUE.Yet I still enjoyed TEMPLE & to some degree THE CRYSTAL SKULL (it was LaBeouf who spoiled that particular film for most it seems? EVERYONE else
in that film was FINE & DANDY & as for the UFO / ET's? Well, it didn't bother me as much as it did some it seems, it would have played out better without LaBeouf in it, I think) although it has it's moments.As for TEMPLE, that was probably a bit too dark for me, I rather liked the OPENING half of that film more than the second inside the Temple & the goings on underground just wasn't half as exciting as having the NAZI's in pursuit in 'RAIDERS' & 'CRUSADE'.Spielberg knew this (he even said so in an interview) and so they returned INDY back into this sphere when making the wonderfully entertaining 'THE LAST CRUSADE' which brought about a legendary double act performance from both CONNERY & FORD that just makes that adventure fly by.I could have happily watched these two play out more adventures all day long.So Script wise & Story wise...HOW DOES 'The Dial of Destiny' compare?Although it's not in the same league as the BEST TWO (by far) the script is fine, there's not a lot that stops you in your tracks, but it does it what it needs to...THESE are ACTION / ADVENTURE FILMS, so the script is sort of secondary, it helps if they're better but I think it's the STORY CHOICE which helps them more as to how much your going to LOVE THEM...or NOT.Raiders & The Last Crusade for me are 10's (they actually rate 8.4 for Raiders & 8.2 for Crusade which on IMDb is right up there scoring)But which of the remaining THREE INDY films rates NOW rates the BEST out of them?IMDb has 'The Temple of Doom' in 3rd with a highly respectable score of 7.5 and 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' comes in with a low 6.2, which rates that particular film as the WORST of the INDY films in the series.ME?I like Both of those to various degrees & it's a close call as to which I like best between the battle for 4th & 5th place in Indiana Jones films...probably CRYSTAL surprisingly as the Action was better done as a whole.My 3rd BEST INDIANA JONES outing is this one ""Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny""I know that will irk some (especially regarding 'The Temple of Doom' whom many will have in 3rd)IMDb is currently rating this FINAL :( but about TIME ;) Harrison Ford Indiana Jones outing at a surprising 6.7.WHY surprising? Well after reading some reviews & the early thoughts upon it's release to cinema's I figured this might end up scoring less than 'CRYSTAL SKULL' and be closer to the 6 mark than 7, so it's seems there is SOME LOVE for this final adventure.MOST Indiana Jones fans will enjoy THIS, they'll accept it's THE GREAT Harrison Ford's swan song in the role & that it could it have been better?Is it a BAD FILM? No, far from it, If you LOVE INDY you'll probably (if not LOVE this film) ENJOY IT.We see old Indy about to retire before being thrust back into Adventure by his God Child I think she was?A SPIRITED PERFORMANCE by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, yes I had heard that some didn't like her, I cannot understand why? I think she was a GREAT FUN, her character was a HOOT & not quiet as driven by MONEY & FAME as we first thought.Loved the opening 20 minutes or so (with an AI Young Indy) after this it's true it didn't really KICK ON as I hoped it might but he's OLDER...I LOVED that Indy actually ""GOT TO SEE HISTORY"" ;) and with that we say GOODBYE to a LEGENDARY MOVIE CHARACTER & Performance from...Mr Harrison Ford (And MANY THANKS)","

"morganyadron-36211","30 June 2023","I wanted this movie to be good so badly. The first 20 minutes are absolutely spectacular. The second act falls flat and loses the spark of the first. Also, it is very jarring to the viewer to see the first 20 minutes and go from that to Indiana Jones: depressed, gloomy alcoholic who lives in a small New York apartment. Completely disrespects the beloved character. Also, phoebe waller bridge is intolerable. Very poorly written character, condescending and patronizing to Indiana. It may as well be her movie because she does all of the work and thinking while Indiana does nothing.Final act and climax are good, a little far fetched but redeem the second act and it's boring-ness. Overall, depressing movie that doesn't have the speilberg/Lucas magic, ruined by ""Helena Shaw"" and her ""know it all/condescending"" attitude. Wait for this to come out on Disney plus! Save yourself money and don't give Disney more than they deserve. This movie was not and Indiana jones movie and any true Indy fan knows that.","

"SnoopyStyle","31 August 2023","It's the last days of WWII in Europe. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) are trying to steal artifacts from the Nazis. Nazi scientist Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) discovers Archimedes' Dial amongst all the fake relics. It's years later while America celebrates the moon landing. A tired Indy is retiring from teaching. Basil's daughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) shows up looking for the Dial.One thing I don't like is the over-reliance on CG. The de-aged Indy is fine with me. There's no other way to do that opening. They can shoot the back of his head for only so long. The tech has improved to a point of acceptable. The bigger problem is the non-stop use of CG. I'm not a troglodyte. Tech moves on but it doesn't have to be that obvious and in your face. A bit of real world filming would go a long way. Stunts are more thrilling. Vistas are more epic. Everything is more real.As for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, at least she's not Kate Capshaw. I can see why they picked her, but she comes with some baggage. First, she has her sarcastic smirk which works really well in a sarcastic TV comedy. It doesn't work when Indy constantly tells her that they're Nazis. She keeps smirking at him for one of two possibilities. She doesn't believe him or she doesn't care. Neither is appealing for the character. We need to love her like we love Marion. I don't see that happening. If they picked the right actress, Helena could conceivably continue the franchise after trying to do that for Mutt. I don't see that happening either.This is a fine send-off for a beloved cinematic character. It's far from the best of the franchise, but there is nothing outright bad in this movie. It has its big action although they are all CG. Harrison is still Indy. He's having his adventures. There is a wrap-up to his personal story. There is no need to fear a return to the silly Crystal Skull or a screaming Kate Capshaw. This is fine.","

"cardsrock","16 July 2023","I will say that this is about as good as an Indiana Jones film starring an 80 year old Harrison Ford could be. It was a bit tough to see our once great hero struggle to get around. I never really needed to see an old, bitter Indy saddle up for one last adventure, but Dial of Destiny does a decent job of making a compelling film out of that premise.There are some surprisingly emotional beats and some rousing action to balance out the ""but why"" nature of the film. PWB is a nice addition and brings some spunk and charm that Crystal Skull was missing. There's not peak Spielberg inventive action and humor here, but it's not a shell of itself either. Mangold is a very capable filmmaker and I feel like did the best he could with what he was given. The story goes in a wild direction in the last act, and while I didn't completely balk at it, I'm not sure I loved it. Mads is a solid villain and the Nazi element didn't feel too forced. Overall, the globetrotting fun is hard to deny.This film was really not necessary, however it isn't anywhere near as bas as it could have been, so that's a win I guess? Now please, I'm begging you, let Indy rest.","

"pinballwizard-83712","4 July 2023","James Mangold's meticulously-crafted thrilling sequel to the beloved Indiana Jones franchise is exceptional. Old pro Harrison Ford at the age of 80 triumphantly returns for one final time in his iconic role as the legendary adventurer archaeologist Indiana Jones and delivers a truly brilliant and impressive performance of great physicality. Taking place in the year 1969 Indy is a retire college professor living in New York City who will soon have to race to retrieve an ancient artifact known as the 'Dial of Archimedes' that has the power create a portal in time, before a nefarious Nazi nemesis from his past, Dr. Voller, terrifically played by Mads Mikkelsen, and his murderous thugs, memorably played by Brad Holbrook as the sleazy and malicious Kiaber, and Olivier Richters as the towering muscle-bound killer Hauke, get a hold of it and change the course of history by making sure the Nazis win World War II. Indy will be reluctantly aided by his Goddaughter Helena, marvelously played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and her young sidekick Teddy, wonderfully played by Ethan Isidore. Skillful direction by Mangold, superlative supporting performances by Toby Jones, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renee Wilson, and Thomas Kretschmann. Exquisite cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, exhilarating action sequences that are sensational, magnificent visual effects, with the great John Williams' timeless score adding a grandeur to this wonderful motion picture. A highly entertaining and satisfying conclusion that is fitting goodbye to the greatest adventure hero in cinematic history.","

"thinkMovies","3 September 2023","The first 21 minutes is a video game about WWII Nazis hauling archeological treasure for the Fuhrer. They were hoping for the lance that drew Jesus' blood on the cross, but they got a fake instead of the real one, yet, they had no idea that another of the artifacts in their possession could find holes in time and do the time travel thing. It's the Antikythera mechanism! An AI de-aged-for-1945 Indy keeps the breakneck pace of the video game going.The next 25 minutes are also a video game gone awry, that's trying to bring the funny, but Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins would find nothing funny in this mess.The minutes roll on relentlessly and, now, we are chasing the Antikythera mechanism. The real one was discovered in 1901-2 in a Roman shipwreck 130 feet underwater near the island of Antikythera estimated at approximately 70-130 Before Common Era, and all of it was found in one lump -and nobody knows when it was constructed or by whom. The movie artifact is supposed to be a perfectly preserved half part of the mechanism, constructed by ancient mathematician Archimedes in 260 BCE, discovered in 1905 at 130 and at 260 feet, with the Indy-travel-map showing our heroes searching off Athens instead of at the real discovery location... Indy must find the other half of the machine but a Nazi wants to travel back to 1939, change history and have Nazi Germany win WWII. Indy has a Greek diver friend with a boat off Athens but his friend with a boat off Athens turns out to be Spanish. And, the Aegean Sea is referred to as an ocean.They find the thing in an underwater cave full of eels instead of the usual snakes, fly through time in a Nazi plane, land in 260 BCE instead of 1939 CE, they meet Archimedes during a Roman siege of Syracuse speak perfect modern Greek to him, he responds in perfect modern Greek, Indy wants to stay but his goddaughter punches him unconscious and flies him back to Manhattan, circa 1969 where Marion stops the divorce proceedings and brings the groceries.Are there any questions as to why Steven did not direct this one?I was 23 when I saw Raiders. I'm 65 now. If I live another 23 years to 88 it will be a nice book ends for a life lived with Indy. I have too much respect for what Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas brought to us with Indy's adventures so I can't bring myself to cry out WTF about this last Indy we'll ever see... (but, hey... WTF)","

"antoniatejedabarros","13 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is one of the best Indiana Jones movies (my favorites are this one and Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom). I don't get the ""critics"" (how easy is to criticise when you create nothing). This sequel is super fun, entertaining, human, and cool. Absolutely gorgeous art direction, flawless special effects, and -the most important thing- a great story line. My three children and I had a terrific time. This is a movie for teenagers and for Indiana Jones lovers. I only feel that the cast could have been better (there are some anachronisms and, yes, I still find there there were too little women). Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has archeology, mathematics, and history involved, so, thanks a lot to the writers for finally moving away from the ""TaNaK/Bible"" narrative. Harrison Ford's performance is stunning. Today (July 13) he turns 81 years old and his Indiana Jones character was flawless, human and deep. A movie for having fun, learn a bit of history, and enjoying. 9/10 (1 point for the script, 1 point for Archimedes, 1 point for Harrison Ford, 1 point for Mads Mikkelsen, 1 point for the music (John Williams), 1 point for the stunning special effects, 1 point for the fun, 1 point for the art direction and 1 point for the year 69).","

"jon-22643","2 September 2023","Sure, many will argue it could have been much better, I agree that the plot is messy, and the story and execution could be better, still you should remember that Ford is an old dude now and also his character in the movie, and old man can't run, fight or do all the things his young character could the the prior movies.Ford is giving everything he's got in the movie, despite his age. His character also straggles with aging and all that comes with it along the entire movie.It's not a secrete that for a small portion of the movie the makers used special effects to make him look young, for me it was the best portion, it brought back the feeling of the 1st movie, it felt like a tribute to this iconic character and also to Ford.All the actors are giving a great performance, I wish the plot would be tighter, but it is what it is.In short, this last chapter is about old man Indiana Jones, a beaten and broken man (the reason is discovered later in the movie), who is forced, despite of his will, into his last adventure that will hopefully save his spirit, you'll need to watch the movie to understand.I liked the movie and you will too.","

"vandykeu","2 July 2023","I saw this new addition to the Indiana Jones franchise yesterday, and I've taken some time to collect my thoughts on it. Upfront, I think it is mostly better than Crystal Skull, but it is nowhere near the level of the original three films. Broadly speaking, it avoids many of the problems that I had with that film, especially its just outrageous circumstances. Despite being films that rely on the supernatural for their plot points, Indy films are best when they are still rooted in basic physics. Look at Raiders and Last Crusade- you don't find too many instances in those films that are quite simply unbelievable. Here, for the most part, Dial of Destiny avoids those unbelievable circumstances (though Indy's hat not blowing off on the train in the beginning sequence does bother me at some level).I found the acting and the characters to be mostly pretty good. I liked the chemistry between Ford and Waller-Bridge. I liked the cameos. Where the film falls apart in this department is that none of the villains outside of Mikkelson are given much to do. Boyd Holbrook in particular is basically a lurching punching bag with an itchy trigger finger, and that is the extent of his development. The biggest surprise was Antonion Banderas, who I didn't recognize until about halfway through his performance. He was great.The downside to this film is the detail of its story. The concept is great, and fits well within the Indy universe. I in particular liked the more emotional moments where Ford had to actually do a bit of acting. This fits well in line with the emotional growth in Last Crusade and it was good to see. Likewise, the broad strokes of the plot and Helena's character made sense, but the details were very muddled. I didn't even really know where the plot was going until about 40 or 50 minutes in. Is Helena good? Bad? Good again? Bad again? It flip-flopped on her too many times, and not in ways that made sense. Outside of her first few minutes, I never once believed her motivations and it felt as if her motivations were created simply to build fake drama.The action sequences are far too long, which is only allowed because of their CGI nature. You couldn't make a film with such exhaustingly boring action scenes like this 30 years ago, which forced Spielberg to make smarter editing choices than he did even in Crystal Skull, and that problem continues here. You could shave a good 10 minutes off of each of the major action sequences and lose absolutely nothing from the film, and it would be better for it. It is, for all intents and purposes, and animated movie.After these details, my biggest complaint is that it looks too much like Crystal Skull. The lighting is too dark, too bright, and too soft. Like Crystal Skull, it just looks blown out and fake. Go back and watch the originals- especially Last Crusade- and look at how crisp the photography is. Even today, it looks incredible. The rotoscoping of scenes in front of Petra are noticeable, but still look really good. Here, nothing looks good. It's almost as painful on the eyes as was Crystal Skull, or the Hobbit movies. Why?As Ford's almost certain departure from Indy, I think it does ok by him. It allows him to complete his character in a way that makes sense. I am happy for him in that regard. As others have said, I am not sure that we needed this film for anything else, and I am not sure that its good points outweigh its bad ones. Being better than Crystal Skull is hardly a noteworthy accomplishment.","

"gsanvin","2 July 2023","After Kingdom of the Crystal Skull the series had nowhere to go but up and it certainly did that. If you are a fan of Indiana Jones you should like this one. It's not up there with Raiders or Last Crusade but it made up for the disastrous Crystal Skull. Indiana Jones is at his best fighting Nazis so every angle of that has now probably been checked off.This time most of the action is set in 1969 as Indy is trying to keep the Nazis from obtaining both halves of Archimedes Dial of Destiny with which the Nazis believe they can transport through time to alter the outcome of WWII. Of course we have an evil Nazi scientist, knowing all of Hitler's mistakes, plans to use that knowledge to replace Hitler and create a Nazi reign of 1,000 years, blah, blah, blah.The Nazi angle is a bit worn thin by the 5th film now and there are plot holes they don't even attempt to close up but.... but... set that aside, don't over analyze the thing and enjoy the 2hr long ride, It's worth it!","

"Micke_Eriksson","12 October 2023","I was very disappointed with this. I was soaking it in as the story went along, the details left & right, and starting to figure out what the end would be like (I'm not pointing out what I'm referring to, so that I don't spoil it for anyone), just like with the previous installments.They mention or speak about a specific thing, its uses, why or how they would do a certain thing, and somehow thanks to clever (and often predictable) writing, it was where the story was heading.However, this was not the case and I was very annoyed when the movie suddenly and abruptly ended on an unsung note, on a road not traveled, and the movie ended just as bad as it had started with non-status quo.The action was as good as could be expected, partially because of the character Indy & his bad (?) luck, and with his age accounted for, so it was good. It's just the ending that really annoyed me. At least The Last Crusade had a nice ending, of which I was expecting something similar in this one...
One could only pray that they've got some alternate extended Directors Cut-ending coming on Bluray where they change the ending completely and make it right.I was really looking forward to this movie since it was announced, but it was a huge disappointment thanks to this.I rated this 6 out 10, and I gave one of those points for the action-scenes for the first 80% of the movie, for Indy's spunk, the rest was so that it would average (There are worse movies after all!).","

The last act between the plane taking off and
them being back in NYC , just suspending
disbelief too too far.There were shimmers of the old indy but i really think after KOCS they should have left well alone. I had maybe too high hopes for james mangold , he delivered in parts but the rest just feels very much like the cash cows tit being squeezed till it drops off and it kinda tarnishes a great cinimatic character and the reasons why they pulled em in at the box office.Unlike belloq's pocket-watch, sadly i dont think if we burried this in the sand for a thousand years it would end up being priceless.","

When we heard this movie would open on our 39th wedding anniversary, we knew what our date was going to be. We were pretty excited. When we got our first apartment, we put up just one movie poster in our home, and it was of Indiana Jones. When I got my first smart phone, the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme became the ringtone for my husband. When my husband's employer encouraged employees to wear costumes for Halloween, my husband already had the right hat so he got the other accessories and he's been going as Indiana Jones-even won a prize-so we are big fans of this movie franchise. We're just not the sort of fans who must complain about the sequels. I don't understand fans who want to nitpick and tear apart all the sequels. I don't know how people like that can ever be satisfied.Dial of Destiny was a very satisfying bookend to Raiders of the Lost Ark-a perfect bookend! I'm frankly baffled that some people are complaining. I don't know how it could've been better! I'm elated that the cast got together to make this movie, and the story was terrific! They certainly didn't have to do it, but they did, and I'm so glad they did! Many of our friends who have seen it loved it too. I don't know what the complainers wanted or hoped for, but my husband and I enjoyed it so much, we're considering going to see it again in the theater! It's been a looooong time since we've done that, but we already want to watch it again, and we don't want to wait for streaming or DVDs to come out.This movie exceeded our expectations.

The plot was convoluted...and when it wasn't is was just a big non-stop chase. What the movie lacked most was comedic touches. If you look at a list of the director's movies they are all kind of depressing. Logan. Cop Land. Almost zero comedic touches. Instead of Marigold imagine if Gunn had directed this? More than comedic touches the movie needs to be fun and adventurous. That's the whole point of the series - an homage to those old timey serial adventures set in exotic lands.","

"saint_brett","29 June 2023","""Destiny of Doom"" is a jumbled mess like eggs mixed with jelly crystals and corn flour. It starts out with the standard Nazi Stormtroopers who have captured a CGI Indiana Jones, and it quickly descends from there and begins to ball and chain the viewer from all the corn flour that's coagulated around your ankles.If you've got a choc top in your hand in the cinema, you better hurry up and eat it quickly, or else it'll melt as the movie runs like a Boston marathon. Careful you don't get deep knee thrombosis from sitting down too long.In an attempt to revive a pulse in the plot, they fall back on the tried and tested chase scenes to build movie momentum, from songthaews to speeder bikes, cars and a ""Solo"" train chase scene. The movie tries to emulate ""Super Mario Brothers"" with all the carting around while defying gravity with no cohesion and a plot that jumps all over the shop.The ending wasn't explained properly, as the villain wanted to kill Hitler, but he was secretly a star-struck fanboy who idolized him at the same time. I guess the ending is confused, as word on the street is that there were numerous reshoots that only wrapped up a couple of months ago.There's no point using the retro characters in ""Destiny of Doom,"" as they only have cameo roles to play and last about as long as you eat your choc top.Ford looks like a tanned piece of leather who's fighting a losing battle in the moisturization stakes. They use CGI to make him look younger, but he just comes across as looking like an Ed Gein victim who has been patched up with fish skin and wax and walking around like a Terminator endoskeleton. He should do a whole Madonna makeover and go to extremes to retain that eternal look of youth.That's what the next movie should be called, ""Indiana Jones and The Eternal Quest for the Fountain Of Youth."" He goes back in time to find the formula to remain young and has to steal pages from Estee Lauder and Neutrogena. Jamie Lee Curtis can join him as they're no longer marketable in Hollywood anymore.The T-800 was made out to be an apron-wearing furniture salesman in the last ""Herminator"" movie. It's a wonder Indy wasn't a typing receptionist for a women's law firm in this like Hemsworth in ""Ghostbusters.""Snarky Fleabag plays a con woman who's motivated by greed and deception and is not suited for the role as an adventure character. So, she wants to travel back in time to steal artifacts and claims that they should be preserved or sent back to their rightful owners, but she secretly wants to sell them to the highest bidder. She's known for her acting in some ""Fleabag"" TV show that's based on comedy, but all her attempts at humor in this make her out to be a typical modern-day stooge who's bred from Hollywood's standard stock ranks of robots and stiff power girls who pledge their allegiance to Left-Wing practices and follow She-Ra: Princess of Power principles.They should have cast Brie Larson in this instead of what's-her-name where she could have played the daughter of Elsa who was out to avenge her mother's death and held Indiana Jones responsible. Imagine the female empowerment Larson would have brought to the table.The CGI is outdated old format from 1993, and I love how the characters have Marty McFly's button on their clothes and can dry off in seconds.After being punched out by Fleabag, Indiana Jones returns to his senses and the film ends with Indy's hat hanging outside an apartment door. As the screen closes out, Indy grabs it as if to claim his rightful title back, as the original plot, by Kathleen Kennedy, had Fleabag assuming the role and actually becoming Indiana Jones after they killed him off. (Did we just dodge a bunch of Indiana Jones movies starring a female lead?)Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm must never work on another ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"" project ever again. You've destroyed the legend and legacy of both these franchises... that I no longer care for.Congratulations, Kennedy, you got what you set out to achieve and have sunk both franchises to a pit of despair and apathy. If Kathleen Kennedy became the owner of a basketball club, they'd fold within a year and be relegated to a Canadian division.Angelina Jolie's ""Tomb Raider"" was the Indiana Jones for women. Wasn't that enough? Now Kennedy has to emasculate Ford's character and had original intentions of replacing him with the British actress for future projects.And Bob Iger continues to give her a golden handshake?""Destiny of Doom"" runs so long that your ice cream melts, your popcorn blue molds, and you start growing weeds and roots in your cinema seat. Not to mention how boring it is.","

"coachsalm","10 July 2023","I have grown up with the Indiana Jones movies, so perhaps I'm biased, but I don't know what more Indiana fans could want in a movie. We get one last time to spend 150+ minutes with our favorite archeologist.The gift of Harrison Ford keeps giving and after 40+ years the 80 year old Harrison/Indiana gives a great and appropriate performance. I thought the de-aging scenes were great and incredibly natural looking.The action scenes were exciting and didn't drag on as they did in the interminable Flash and recent Guardians of the Galaxy. The CGI wasn't overwhelming and didn't detract from the movie as in those above mentioned movies and the latest Any Man film.The story was great and all the performances were in keeping with the exceptional jobs done by actors in the other movies in the series.If you're an Indy fan go see the movie and enjoy yourself!","

"glstrom-14260","1 August 2023","I am pretty sure we all know that nazis were bad, the worst of the worst and probably best forgotten than reworked into every story needing a villain. The whole set up for these bad guys is unreal (cia backing him?) and the innocents dying is unacceptable. SOBs did enough killing so now we need to see nice old woman shot in back running away to prove they are evil? Know it all god daughter and her half mustached pick pocket punk did nothing to add to the story, neither likable or believable. (yeah, I can drive a scooter and fly a plane...at the same time!!!) Oh, and when shot I am pretty sure you don't want to go skydiving, and how is it again nazi boy figured out they were heading to Sicily, going west? Really quite a stretch but nice Karen Allen got invited to the show, glad she wasn't shot like everyone else then quickly dismissed....where is the fun in that?! Bye Indy, you were cool and had hell of a run.","

"bregund","4 July 2023","Disney seems to be on a mission to destroy all popular white male characters, but even beyond that, I find it hard to believe that Harrison Ford read the script and happily signed up. Is this really how he wanted his character to go out? Or are we going to see him in a wheelchair sometime in 2033, with his unappealing ""god daughter"" wheeling him around Prague or Cairo? In terms of costars, at this point he has run out of family members and now he's cycling through family acquaintances. Why not the nephew of his college roommate or his dry cleaner? By far the best chemistry Indiana Jones ever had with a costar was with Sean Connery, even Shia Laboeuf was okay, but this odd, unappealing ""god daughter"" belittling and emasculating him is unbearable to watch. It's difficult to believe that Ford thought this was a good idea. See what I mean, elder abuse.","

"johnowen72","22 December 2023","Actually enjoyed the first 2/3rds of the film apart from the shocking CGI in the first 20 mins. But at the 3/3 point WTF it's crystal skull bad in fact it's think it's worse than crystal skull it's that bad. TT for no purpose but to add a reason to the story. Old characters brought back what for nothing but a link to the good stuff that we loved in the past Why it didn't need it there were so many chances to end Indy's story so much better than this. What's happened to real writers and director's all that seems to be coming from the industry is tick boxing employees hell bent on taking home a pay check at the expense of real entertainment.",NA
"comps-784-38265","14 July 2023","I came to watch this with no expectations having watched the crystal skull debacle .The mistake was moving away from the traditional 'good guy hero' Indy, fights against the odds and wins. Into some fantastic sci-fi rompThis film nearly pulls it off because it sticks with the original premise (for the most part) and I enjoyed following Indy into 'old age' and ably acted by Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller Bridge. They nearly 'had it' and it was a great trip into nostalgic Indy filmsBut the resort of unimaginative writers is to go into Sci-Fi 'la la land' so anything is 'possible' no matter how implausibleIt's a solid film , 7/10 , would I watch it again? Yes probably but with a bit of irritation :)",NA
"dcrocetti","3 July 2023","I guess it all depends on what direction the film wanted to go to. Ford mentioned it's action but action with a purpose...in so many words. That being the case, it was well done.But if you're lookin for the action content of the first two films, it's not quite there.Perhaps the character development of Indiana has changed some bit to reflect some of the usual behaviors were used to seeing. Indiana Jones looked and seemed wiser. So, you would have to take that in perspective. Without spoiling anything, it has more emotional content.And I'll always mention on any film, never go see a movie with expectations.",NA
"dan_slentz","1 July 2023","From Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies.Reel Tunez Movie Review (6/30/23): ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"".First, It was awesome seeing Indy back in action. The movie starts in 1969 but we get to see some different eras within this movie. The digital recreations of Harrison Ford worked, but computer recreations have yet to really capture the same emotion/personality/humanity/soul of people (and that's probably a good thing).Effects were very good and Harrison Ford is a fine actor. Some of the previous Indiana Jones friends/characters in this movie were great to see again. Of course the actors are much older and it's conveyed in the movie and not really hidden... especially when Indy needs to take off running and some of the physical action (as expected).As for the movie, I think the fact that I was really excited to see this movie, I was let down by it. Frequently, when you are looking forward to a movie and think how great it will be, you are often let down. Sometimes you expect nothing from a movie, so you're surprised you enjoyed it. In this case, really liking the Indiana Jones franchise, I felt the story line as more along the lines of Crystal Skull or the last movie. Really, for me, it just wasn't anywhere near as fun or cool as the first two Indy adventures.Yes.. I believe this must really be the last adventure for Indy. Don't worry.. no spoilers here. I know Ford is getting up in age, but he's still a great actor, so I'm hoping there's more movies ahead for him (""Regarding Henry"", 1991, was a BIG favorite of mine for him! If you haven't seen it.. it really IS a ""must see"".)Overall, I'd give this about a 5.5 out of 10. Unlike IMDB's straight 1-10 (where some people ridiculously give anything and everything a 10), I look at a 5 as the tipping point. Anything above a 5 is worth seeing, and below is a turkey. When a movie hits a 6, it's a decent movie. A 7 really is a good movie. 8 and 9 are crazy good. And 10 is reserved for something that is really off-the-charts incredible (and likely to be a ""classic""). So if you loved the franchise (like I do), YES.. see this last Indiana Jones, and be sure to see it at a good theater where the John Williams compositions and incredible audio are presented in their best quality.. and laser video projection to see how beautiful it looks. Don't go in even remotely thinking the story line will be half as fun as the first two and keep expectations a bit 'low', and you'll probably enjoy it more than I did. (Since IMDB does whole stars, I rounded it up to a 6 for this review on their site)",NA
"brentscott","29 June 2023","I too was expecting garbage because of the terrible reviews from critics and all the set leaks but I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is coming from someone who thought the Disney Star Wars were awful and hasn't been happy with Lucasfilms output since being owned by Disney.Harrison Ford will always be my favorite actor. He never ceases to make me smile and his final turn as Indy was no exception. Phoebe Waller-Bridge wasn't nearly as terrible as the leaks made her out to be and frankly her character is supposed to be unlikeable a good part of the movie. I loved the opening scene that takes place in the 40s as well. Definitely better than Crystal Skull but if you expected it to be as good as the original 3 you're a putz. Enjoy it for what it is. Harrison Ford won't be around much longer and we likely won't ever get to see him in another action role.",NA
"angladafrank","30 August 2023","Seeing most reviews online for this new unneeded sequel to a beloved franchise (at least as far as the 3 first movies are concerned) I was expecting wqay worse with a movie that disrespected the franchise and characters.Au contraire, it is a decent movie and a nice sendoff for Indy. Infact I even found it better than the previous one.The movie is far from perfect, is completely uneeded and is clearly not as good as the original tyrilogy but is a decent piece of entertainment in the end.It was not worth seeing in theatres but it is still wort seeing for what it is: a decent action flick and a decent sendoff to the beloved character Indiana Jones.",NA
"JackCowart34","3 July 2023","One-sentence summary: Indy and his goddaughter embark on a globe-spanning adventure to keep a powerful ancient relic out of the hands of the evil Nazi, Dr. Voller.Maybe my expectations were too high going into Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. I didn't think the series was going to recapture the magic of the original trilogy, but with James Mangold behind the camera, I thought there was a good probability of high-quality cinema. Can you blame me? He's done some fantastic work over the course of his career, directing movies like 3:10 to Yuma, Knight and Day, Walk the Line, and Ford v Ferrari, just to name a few. This sequel, released 42 years after the character debuted, clearly had insurmountable odds. Harrison Ford is an eighty-year-old man, and the job given to Mangold was to somehow make his stunts look convincing to an audience. To try and realize that objective, he ended up over-editing the action scenes involving ""Old Indy"" so extensively that it's near impossible to follow. That would be a major issue in any adventure movie, and Indiana Jones isn't an exception. There were segments here and there (the prologue, the parade) that I thought were memorable, and whenever Ford and Mads Mikkelsen were on the screen at the same time, I was locked in, but I can't say that made it worth sitting through the long 154-minute runtime. I went in wanting to enjoy myself, and now I find myself pleading for Disney to finally retire Indiana Jones.",NA
"jmcfrancis","30 August 2023","If this is the final Indy movie, I'd be happy. Not that they should stop but that this is a fitting end to the legendary film series. The opening, in particular, is a fantastic example of why Indy is a popular character, and the rest of the film holds up well, keeping the action more grounded (mostly) and mixing new ideas with franchise homages.But there is a glaring issue, at least for me. The script is full of unresolved issues and ex machina intervention. For example, Indy is framed for murder, but that never plays a role again whatsoever. There are many more, but I'll leave it at that.It feels like there was a longer edit for this movie, then they trimmed it down, leaving a lot of strange gaps and strange edits. Nothing that breaks the stories or characters. But it is very sloppy, and not appropriate for a blockbuster movie. I give the film 8/10, but the directing gets just 5/10 for the many inconsistencies and dead-end points.Other than that, a fun film. It even sorta redeems Crystal Skull.",NA
"Terrifying_Tigerfish","30 June 2023","I went in not having interest in seeing this (he's very old, and it seemed like another cash grab)...but with a group of friends, why not go?I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is ridiculous (some scenes are gleefully violent and chaotically captivating), and entertaining. I saw it in IMAX, and I'm happy I did.The movie is derivative (expected). Nothing unique, novel, or previously unseen (a spoiler here would ne one has never seen a treasure hunting action adventure a la Mummy etc). But, the spectacle of the show and seeing some highly kinetic and fun sequences was well worth it. Will I probably forget the movie? Maybe the overall plot, but, honestly, not some sequences-ludicrous and cartoonish to the point of laughter. Not necessarily surprising, given that it's directed by James Mangold, and his sequences in Logan were comparable.",NA
"i_dont_even","5 July 2023","Usually characters have a point behind their motivation, even if its stretched. Not in this movie. Every motivation and the reason why characters participate in the story is completely wrong. Nobody has a point during back and forth bickering, and basically it's written as any character could participate in that story, which exception of couple sentences.The only substance in this movie is some bad action.This is a good movie only if you have lapses in judgement, heat waves happening, I can see why this is still in 7 regon.My intelligence has been offended, and I am not very intelligent.",NA
"BlokeWithABrainUK","16 August 2023","A short review for this one:The de-aging technology is very impressive.It reunites some of our favourite characters from the first three.Waller-Bridge is quite good.It's has all the main elements you would expect.It does finally wrap the franchise up with a bow.Obviously it isn't a patch on the original three, but it is considerably better than the fourth debacle.Such an iconic and beloved character deserved a better send-off than being a badly CGI'd Tarzan impersonator (embarrassingly replete with overdubbed Tarzan yell).Not a film you would be likely to watch repeatedly, but worth your time.",NA
"Dragonsouls","5 December 2023","(Spoiler free review) of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. I liked the premise of the film, which was loosely based on an ancient Greek artifact called the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek astronomical calculator.The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known analogue computer. Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC.The film is about a race to retrieve this Dial of Destiny. A Nazi Physicist is obsessed with the artifact because he belived it could alter time. Indiana Jones tries to stop him, in order to stop him from taking advantage of such a powerful weapon.It's a bit exaggerated of course, because in real history, the Antikythera mechanism merely calculated the dates of lunar and solar eclipses, and modeled the moon's subtle apparent motions through the sky. It was not a mechanism for Time Travel like insinuated in the film. The artifcat was romanticized in the film and the nazi scientists believe it has supernatural capabilities that can cause it to create fissures in timelines, allowing time travel.The film was action heavy, like all of the Jones' films were, and it was pretty well choregraphed. I'm not an action film guy but some of the action scenes were done well. I loved the old 1960s NYC setting and the old cars. The production level was massive.However, the film was way too long. Running time is 2:47 minutes and it dragged a bit during the middle of the film. James Mangold is a very good director but this film was a far cry from the old Stephen Spielberg ones. The Last Crusade was my favorite, as well as the Temple of Doom, but this lastest installment in the Indiana Jones Franchise was was just meh.... The definition of a ""popcorn film.""",NA
"Slarkshark","2 July 2023","One final grand adventure for Indiana Jones. It's by no means his greatest, but it ain't bad. Especially after playing the character for 42 years.With rating this a 7, I now have an Indiana movie with their own ranked number from 6 to 10. 10 being Raiders; 9 Last Crusade, 8 Temple of Doom; 7 Dial of Destiny; 6 Crystal Skull.The de-aged beginning sequence was quite well done. Ford looked really good, but you can tell it's definitely his older voice. The rest of the CGI throughout was overused, so so, and obvious. I just prefer the practical effects from the originals and in general so much more. You'd think that's one thing they would have learned from 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'.Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character I found pretty annoying through most of the film. Boyd Holbrook is quickly becoming a favourite of mine.The film itself was fun, but got better in its final act. The middle portion was a let down. Those skeletons would not last that long underwater... sorry, but that bothered me.",NA
