"Top_Dawg_Critic","17 February 2023","As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.","

"cardsrock","17 February 2023","After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out.","

"flicklover","18 February 2023","Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.Just below average in an MCU that is just churning out film after film with diminishing results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films good when they first started. They are getting so formulaic and forgettable.Below average.....Grade: C-","

"poseyfan","17 February 2023","Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me.","

"FeastMode","17 February 2023","I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023, 10/5/2023)","

"jojunno","20 February 2023","Marvel really has fallen and it can't get up. This is the third legacy character that they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man they not only wasted great established characters but superb casts. Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any movie in recent history. MODOK use and ""dick"" turn could be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the movie as if they ran out of budget. What an absolute waste.","

"tabuno","26 April 2023","Visually quite stunning with delightful and creative designs, shapes, and forms while the storyline is less than original without much in the way of intellectual or emotional, ethical depth of other recent Marvel movies. Apparently this movie was focused on being acceptable to a broad audience range, including young people, Quantumania loses some of its sharp refreshing focus. The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions. Yes, this movie provides an amazing backdrop or canvas and yet the substance and plot of the movie does not rise to the same level. What one ends up with is a movie with a lot of flash but less than satisfactory bite.","

"oszajcakk","19 February 2023","New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it.","

"FlashCallahan","21 February 2023",".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.","

"MrDHWong","16 February 2023","""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10.","

"angelamiatt","21 June 2023","...But this film was awful.The story was ridiculous in all ways.Firstly, Hopes mother was in the quantum realm and never told her husband about the entire universe there, with all the species and lives and complex environments.Secondly the ants happened to follow them into the quantum universe but ""on a different stream"" and therefore had eternities to develop and become super intelligent.Thirdly - what the hell was MODOX about? Some second rate character who suddenly appeared in the quantum realm as a head?!Finally, while CGI is great, it loses any excitement when it is the ENTIRE FILM! All I can think of while watching this is that the entire film was filmed in one room on a green screen ... NOTHING is real.I watched this film over 3 weeks in batches of 10 minutes as I was bored. I am never bored of a film. I watch everything! But this film is boring!Honestly - if you need an MCU hit, rewatch one of the Avengers films!","

"rgkarim","17 February 2023","LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"dmoorejr","17 February 2023","Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts.","

"MamadNobari97","16 February 2023","Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men.","

"amooorales","18 February 2023","Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off.","

I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short.","

"glennmeerten06","15 February 2023","Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.","

"andrewchristianjr","15 February 2023","Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible.","

"Tweetienator","19 April 2023","No wonder all those ""creative"" people in so called creative businesses and crafts are afraid of AI - no doubt, in the not too distant future, AI will do the work - cheaper and better than humans can do. At least if Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and such movies (and books, comics, whatever, quantity beats quality these days - in all fields) are the best human mind can come up with. The first Ant-Man movie was a nice one, the second one was okay, but if you take away all the (finally by computer generated) visuals and effects, there is maybe enough story left in this third chapter to employ two or maybe three and a half brain cells of the viewer. The rest of the neural network goes quickly into stand by and sleep mode. I like the production and a few scenes, this is the only reason why this one does not crash totally. But in the end, this is at best mediocre and sometimes even really bad.","

"chgames-28385","23 February 2023","Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!","

"Avwillfan89","18 April 2023","This film is unspeakably bad.It's actually worse than Eternals. Because I didn't care for any of those characters, it didn't bother me as much. Also Chloe Zhao, while being a great director, was simply badly chosen for that kind of film as sci-fi superhero entries are not her strong point.In the case of this, there is absolutely NO excuse for how bad this is. I liked Scott Lang in other films, especially the ensemble ones like Endgame and Civil War. But seeing him in this travesty, where there is no strong development to any of its characters and has one of the weakest plots ever, is truly depressing.Its entire purpose is only to introduce the next big bad guy of the multiverse saga: Kang the Conquerer.Johnathan Majors is probably the best thing about the film, as he really exudes a brooding menace and aggressive physicality. But that's about it.I ACTIVELY despised Cassie Lang in this film. Her character is so annoying, shallow and ridiculously badly written and acted. This is the third time in almost a year that there has been a young character with special abilities or technology whose sole purpose is to move the plot forward and be an inspiration to younger viewers. In the Multiverse of Madness, you had America Chavez, which was actually OK, but you could only kind of get away with it once. The second time with Riri Williams in Wakanda Forever, I was like: Really, again? And then with this, I went: Oh wait, this deliberate goal to create a Mary Sue teenager that promotes activism and surface level inspiration. And is just brilliant at everything she does and never has to learn anything because she is just awesome as she is. Ugh.Also Darren, the villain from the first film, shows up as MODOK as second villain. But then after Cassie simply tells him to ""Stop being a dick."" he... is no longer a villain and now wants to be a hero? That was THE dumbest part of the movie for me. What the hell were they thinking?It's not even worth watching the end-credits, as one has already wasted two hours watching this. I'm glad I didn't waste money in the cinema.Do not bother.","

I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU.","

"vithiet","28 April 2023","As many others have pointed out we are now far from the heydays of peak MCU movies and this is just another reminder of that. The story is not horrible but nothing memorable. The actors are all good at what they do but the characters are uninspiring. The action and special effects still display the usual MCU level of polish but are not necessarily exciting. A better film critic than me could probably point out exactly what was the ""magic"" those movies had up until Endgame that is now completely lost. So as a fine piece of entertainment Quantumania does the trick but don't expect anything more than that.","

"Chance_Boudreaux19","4 March 2023","The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content.","

"PCC0921","18 February 2023","So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.","

Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.

"RussHog","17 February 2023","I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain.","

"PyroSikTh","17 February 2023","I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies.","

You expect something amazing but you get a batch of endless stupidity instead.Kang is killed by advanced ants after being set up as the most powerful version of himself, he doesn't understand how to use his powers in useful ways and it makes me feel like the next team-up movie is gonna be the heroes playing domino's with kang's variants.Modok is literal barbage, and is redeemed by being told not be a bad guy. This movie makes me feel like I've wasted the last three years trying to follow marvel and I will not be going out of my way to watch them anymore.At some points it's so bad it's good, so I'll give it that.","

"Slarkshark","22 May 2023","Ant-Man number 3. Also, number 3 in my rank of the Ant-Man films. It's not terrible, but slightly below average, while the others were more in the average realm, or even slightly above.For some reason, the main cast just didn't seem as good. Possibly the absent of the supporting cast that was in the first two hurt them, and the new supporting cast just didn't quite measure up, other than Bill Murray's brief appearance.Kang, or at least a variant of his has already been introduced in 'Loki'. Now we get to see another Kang... Exile Kang. He who is so cruel, that he had to be exiled by the Council of Kangs. His story started off strong, but is then weakened by his eventual demise. I suppose the threat of Kang lies more in the fact there's a bunch of them conspiring together to conquer.","

"HardLight","15 February 2023","I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will.","

"r96sk","15 March 2023","A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.","

"rcuttill","19 February 2023","We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel.","

"ItsRobinTV","15 February 2023","I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not.","

"bankofmarquis","18 March 2023","The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","

"ossie85","15 February 2023","If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit.","

"exceladeogun","29 April 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: QuantumaniaThe third Antman movie is a departure from the past ones. It is less funny and swamped but carried by its villain. Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is menacing and terrific, he brings many layers to his character, and this is pivotal seeing as he's Marvel's next big bad. Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer also excel in their roles. The visuals are also well-done.The biggest issue with this movie is the plot. The characters don't develop, it's just like a singular occurrence at the end, like a bad dream, and nothing is produced from it save the conglomeration of Kangs. The humour is also lacking, it's sparse and when it's infused it's always wrongly timed.I hope phase 5 can move on smoothly from the spearhead of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.","

"SnoopyStyle","14 April 2023","Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been basking in his Avengers fame. Unbeknownst to him, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to explore the Quantum Realm. They all get pulled down into the realm. Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) had hidden her lost time there spent with supervillain Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).Critical response seems to be middling or worst. I am more in the middling camp. I still really like Scott Lang and Paul Rudd's humor. He remains the best of this section of the MCU. One does question whether he is the one to introduce the big bad of Phase 4. He is the comic relief. He shouldn't lead the universe. I think that it should be Loki. His TV show is what introduced Kang anyways and he could be the unlikely heroic lead. The MCU is becoming unbalanced as the TV shows are overshadowing its supposed superior theatrical releases.As a movie, this feels trapped in the CGI strange world of superhero green screen. It's too chaotic at times. Most of it is super CGI. Kathryn Newton is the new hottie which is a strange thing to say. I miss the baby-faced cutie of the original Cassie. I don't like Janet in this one. Michelle Pfeiffer is stuck in playing the troublesome character. After some time, I realized that she needs to be separated from Hank. They could be arguing over the experiment when it goes off. She is just set up wrong. At the end of the day, this is a pretty simple story and it's the modern-day standard for the superhero movie. It needs more of Ant-Man's humor. He's forced to introduce the next big bad of the new phase which shouldn't be his job.","

It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness.","

"BirdzOfParadise","19 February 2023","Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure.","

"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","18 February 2023","Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee.","

"scotyrocks","17 June 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a serviceable but ultimately forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film has some fun action sequences and visual effects, but the story is weak and the characters are underdeveloped.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are both charming as Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, respectively, but they don't have much to work with here. The supporting cast is also mostly wasted, with Jonathan Majors being the only one who make much of an impression.The film's villain, Kang the Conqueror, is also a disappointment. He's a powerful and menacing figure in the comics, but he's reduced to a generic bad guy here. The film's story also doesn't do much to explore his motivations or backstory.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a disappointing film. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's a forgettable entry in the MCU that fans of the franchise will probably enjoy, but it's unlikely to win over anyone who's not already a fan.","

"nemesis2000-2","19 February 2023","The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun.","

"Roscorox616","18 February 2023","The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie.","

"neil-476","18 February 2023","At last, things are going well for Scott Lang. Reunited with daughter Cassie after the blip, happy in a relationship with Hope, and they and Hank and Janet all safely out of prison, all is well. Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU.","

If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi.

"OnlyAtJMart","17 February 2023","I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of.","

"sgaddala","9 June 2023","""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an absolute disaster of a film, a complete waste of time and money. It is a mind-numbingly boring and convoluted mess, with a plot that makes no sense and characters that are devoid of any depth or purpose. The humor falls flat, the action sequences are uninspired, and the visual effects are underwhelming. It's a painful reminder that not every superhero film can be a hit, and this one is a definite miss. Save yourself the agony and skip this cinematic catastrophe.Save yourself the agony and skip this cinematic catastrophe.

"SureCommaNot","22 February 2023","I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!","

"skuggvarg","21 May 2023","First off: I'm a huge fan of superhero movies in general and I like both Marvel and DC, so this is not a case of taking sides or comparing with the content from the other company.I've liked most Marvel movies so having to admit that Ant-Man 3 was underwhelming is hard for me. I looked forward to it a lot but it just didn't fulfill my expectations, especially since I enjoyed the first two Ant-Man movies.I felt the plot was weak and quite weird. Something of an explanation just to introduce the concept of Kang the Conqueror. That guy definitely needed a better introduction and story, he was just too anonymous here even though I know him from the comics. They didn't succeed here.Also, the actors that played Cassie and Kang felt bad compared to the other actors.I had high hopes for the other villain (no spoilers here), but sadly they made him more of a joke and wasted his potential. In the comics he's a powerful opponent but here the director just wasted him. Bad character portrait, big disappointment.The movie definitely had cool moments and effects but overall it just didn't contribute much worth to the MCU except introducing an upcoming threat.","

All of these were enjoyable films so I was expecting the same for Quantumania but god nothing really got my attention.Nothing here was funny, the funniest parts was the attempts of comedy and emotions. The only humorous part of the entire thing was MODOK And the story of how Kang came to be was really generic plus thing whole thing was very forgettable, I usually remember the movie for at least a year and years if it's a memorable one but I forgot most of the thing that happened here. Me and my friend had more fun eating popcorn than watching this crapThe only thing that holds this from being the worst film I've seen {that goes to Despicable me 3} is the 3rd act climax. The action was great but Kang and Antman's climactic duel was just so dumb.Rating: 3.8/10, one of the worst films I've seen in my life.","

"chrisgavidia","19 February 2023","Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one.","

"questl-18592","25 September 2023","Oh Marvel. I remember once when you were fun. You were appointment movie going. People clamored for the next movie and I would rush out to the theatre the first week to go and see it because I knew, I KNEW, that whatever you put on screen, it was going to be fun. It might not make me think too much, it might not evoke deep thought or emotion, but it'd be pure fun. Then came COVID and my faith was shaken. It's funny, because there was a line from Iron Man 2, ""If you make God bleed, then people will no longer believe in him."" Marvel, you're bleeding.Quantomania is... Fine. There were moments that were funny, but beyond that this movie was utter nonsense. There were no stakes, no sense of what was going on, if anything mattered, it didn't even try to... WHY WERE THERE PEOPLE DOWN THERE?! The only real saving graces here were in the actors. Rudd is as charming and funny as ever. Douglas had some amazing moments that were just really fun. And Majors. Wow. Great great job. I have questions as to how his powers shifted throughout the movie, but that's not him. He gave that character some serious gravitas and interest.For the time being, Marvel was still able to put enough fun in this movie to overwhelm all the stupid, but only just. Those margins are getting thinner and thinner. As someone who has loved these characters since childhood, long before the MCU was a thing, I really hope they sort themselves out because I would love to return to the days when these movies were just raw fun.","

"kevin_robbins","17 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once.","

"Mysterygeneration","22 February 2023","Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments.","

"ladyliliroche","17 February 2023","I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring...","

"subxerogravity","17 February 2023","I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man.","

The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!","

"myblueblazer","22 November 2023","Review: I think some of the reviews are a bit harsh. Though I agree the movie has a good bit of flaws, I thought it was decent. This is a good movie for the Ant-Family, as well as setting up the next big bad of the Marvel Cinematic Universe...KangTakeaways:Fown the yellow Brick Road Allright. The quantumverse is Bizzarre, yet colorful to look at.Paul Rudd once again proves why he IS Ant-Man. I love that he just wants to save the people he loves (his girlfriend and daughter) and not caring about being the grand kal-el savior of the world.I love how similar Evangeline Lilly looks to the comic Wasp Now! Same crop haircut and everything!Michael Douglas and Michele Pfeiffer are once again always great to watch as the veteran heroes and mentors.Cassie Lang comes into her own as a superhero! I love her suit that she designed herself, but what is her super name? (She was called Stature in the comics)in the words of Woody Harrison.... BILL FREAKIN MURRAY!! I loved his small role as Krylar! Even though we didn't see him that much.Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) Returns as a new enemy...MODOK! It is wierd to see him as a deformed Giant head, but he looks like he almost came straight from the comics!Man, I have to tell you, Johnathan Majors just KILLs IT as Kang the Conqueror! I like how regal, powerful, menacing and hi tech he is. I think Stan Lee and Jack Kirby would have been proud to see their big Villian realized!The CGI definitely was not ""super"" but it wasn't entirely Bad.I will say that I wish the ending wasn't as anti-climactic, and that there was a better teaser for the upcoming Kang War.Conclusion: Its up to you whether you want to like this movie. It's not the greatest start to MCU Phase V, but it's enjoyable enough to stay tuned. (Can't say the same for the Eternals Movie. Lol)End credits Scene: COUNCIL OF KANG? ONE THOUSAND KANGS?! LOKI?

"eddie_baggins","16 February 2023","Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"Chalice_Of_Evil","17 February 2023","Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell.","

"rezaeirhamid","23 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out.","

"rannynm","17 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!","

"JackCowart34","21 August 2023","One-sentence summary: Scott, Hope, Hank, Janet, and Cassie are pulled into the quantum realm, where they must contend with the all-powerful Kang the Conqueror.I wouldn't consider Quantumania a full-fledged return-to-form for Marvel, but it did act nicely as a vehicle for Jonathan Majors to flaunt his pristine acting skills. He gets plentiful screen time, especially from the midpoint on, and proceeds to steal every scene while single-handedly raising the stature of the film. Some other positives include a fast-moving pace, a solid amount of quirky comedy, and a smidge of self-awareness, though some of Disney's recent fallbacks still lingered, like the cheesy dialogue and shallow relationship drama. There is an obvious sloppiness to the movie, but there are also just enough pros to warrant checking out the newest Ant-Man.","

"helghast-1337","23 April 2023","Let's be honest. Comic book movies are turning into cookie cutter movies. Bad guys defeated by good guys. It's getting harder and harder for marvel to make good movies with unique dialogue and interesting plots. I liked the first two ant man movies but this one was a dud. One or two memorable moments and an hour and a half of nonsense. The daughter grows up to be an annoying teenager that looks confused most of the time, almost like Bella from Twilight.The multiverse just added a whole bunch of nonsensical things to the already watered down marvel franchise movies and this is just going to get worse. Unfortunately these movies basically print money so there's no reason for them to do anything unique anymore. Shame.","

Most of the jokes land and for once I didnt mind the marvel humor. There were some lines of dialogue that were a little 'cringe' and I think the ending should have been way different. Scott Lang didnt get sidelined as much, but I wish it was still focused on him, as he had to share the screen with four other protagonists. I think they did the story well, but it went from a darker tone to a more 'marvel tone' towards the end. Overall, better than most phase 4 projects, and a pretty decent start to phase 5, would recommend.","

"abirchy-96827","17 February 2023","At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2..","

"Gordon-11","15 February 2023","This film tells the story of Ant Man and his family entering the Quantum realm, causing a lot of adventures and dangers to ensue.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is visually impressive, as there are multiple fantasy science fiction worlds to depict. The imagination runs wild with some of the unearthly characters. The story appears to me rather flat, but that is perhaps due to my lack of love for fantasy realms. To me, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" looks more like a fantasy film than a superhero film. I am not able to relate to the characters or their world. I would have preferred a superhero film to be set in a relatable world.","

"alekspredator87","11 May 2023","Although ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" promised to be a bright sequel to the franchise, I was disappointed after watching the film. The ragged narrative and lack of drama that were promised in the trailer made the film a disappointment for me personally. That's the problem of inflated expectations, which appeared to me thanks to a really cool trailer.I'll scold the script first. It seems that the screenwriters could not fully develop the potential of the film and forgot about the relevance of the whole action in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again and again we see an emphasis on penny intrigues and a purely situational turn of events, which, of course, could work if it were combined with something grandiose. Viewers were promised a large-scale conflict between the new antagonist Kang and Ant-Man and his team. In fact, several new and little-remembered characters with jokes aka ""how many holes does anyone have"" appeared before us, and one of the comic villains turned into a laughing stock at all.One of the main drawbacks of the film is the ragged presentation of the material. The film unsuccessfully veers between drama and trash comedy, which creates an ambiguous impression. Sometimes it seems that the film cannot decide which genre it wants to represent and this reduces the quality of the project, literally dropping it somewhere below the baseboard.But the biggest disappointment for me was the expressionless antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The way it was announced by the creators, the way it was shown in the trailer, absolutely cannot be compared with what happened to be seen in the picture itself. The motivation of the character is poorly worked out, although it is worth paying tribute to the actor Jonathan Majers, who tried, there are no questions to his game, but there are a lot to his hero. The character turned out to be just boring and is forgotten literally five minutes after viewing.The already familiar heroes in the person of Ant, Wasp, Pym family and Scott Lang's daughter were not impressed either. Banal dialogues, movement for the sake of movement, scenario moves do not leave a chance for real drama in this project, although it begins a new chapter of the Cinematic Universe and was announced as a large-scale epic. However, it is worth paying tribute to the visual effects team. The picture is at a height. The quantum world into which the main characters fall is able to surprise the viewer with its scale and all possible colors. The imagination of the creators pleases, showing unusual pictures of a tiny world.In general, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" is definitely not the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A weak drama, an ill-conceived script and a passing plot do not allow this film to stand out from other projects. If you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, then this movie is certainly worth watching, but you should be prepared for the fact that after watching it, an unpleasant feeling of disappointment may remain.6 out of 10.","

"scarsley","21 February 2023","As the years go by, it's obvious that moviegoers are easily fooled in the thinking what is passing for quality.Kevin Fiege, who heads up Marvel has now become the grandmaster of smoke and mirrors. Lazy tropes, and emotionless storylines. Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen. And the fact that the movie he is in is more like a weekly sitcom than an exciting adventure of any kind. Never do you actually feel invested and never do you actually feel as if there is an issue at the heart of the movie.The decline continues.","

"AvionPrince16","16 February 2023","So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.","

"thunt","14 March 2023","I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter.","

"demonblade-37792","19 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion.","

"benjaminskylerhill","17 February 2023","Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with.","

"unsure-1","15 February 2023","Really wanted to like this.Lazy jokes that even Paul Rudd's comedic timing can't remedy. Everyone but Jonathan Majors phoned in their performance. The daughter character is just hard to stomach, some of the cringiest lines and the most wooden, vanilla acting in a while. The ""don't be a dick"" scene was one of the worst.Couldn't get the Council of Ricks impression out of my head watching the mid-credits scene. Despite near-constant action, boring. The few good things: some set design and CGI & the pink blob character were fun, looked great. Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3.","

"owenpont-70803","20 February 2023","Does this film have problems. Yeah, and are the obvious? Yeah, but is this film fun? Absolutely. For this film to have such a low rotten tomatoes score shocks me. I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus.","

"nathangoffnett","3 March 2023","I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor.","

"UniqueParticle","17 February 2023","To me it was a spectacular IMAX experience although there was several errors in the auditorium before the movie there was no commercials with a blank screen longer than usual and after the movie the sound went out it took multiple attempts from the projector to see the credit sequences that's never happened in all years of seeing movies usually sound stuff happens at the beginning. The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before. All around magnificent I love this Ant-Man a lot. Hope anyone appreciates my thoughts if anything I have autism I love being the odd one out from most.","

Story begins with lite comedy scenes and it does not take more time to jump to get seriousness. Once that phase begins story goes in fast mode. One important thing that this movie carry about they give proper job for supporting characters but missed three buddies of Scoot. You know whom I talking about. VFX and CGI was good but not up to the mark. It may have improved if they have given time. Introduction of Daddy Kang was biggest responsibility that this carried out and I am satisfied with that. But movie took my heart in last post credit and I was like i wanted more in that scene. Over all I love this movie as always like antman first and second part does.","

"movietalkwithmuhammed","17 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney.","

"GregTheStopSign95","17 July 2023","I HATE giving this movie such a low score, mainly because I just adore Paul Rudd and he elevates pretty much everything he's in, but he couldn't lift this one enough for me to really care about it much beyond him. And maybe Corey Stoll. I mean, I'm a BIG fan of Michelle Pfeiffer and have been for years, but she doesn't really have much to work with here, and the same goes for Michael Douglas. I'm also becoming a fan of Kathryn Newton but she, too, is given little to really work with here...and don't get me started on Bill ""WISH version of Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster"" Murray's 2 minutes of screen time.All that aside, the Quantum Realm looks amazing, and I REALLY like the aesthetic choices for Kang, and Jonathan Majors put in a really good performance for the role, but he didn't really feel like much of a threat. Especially not compared to the threat he COULD pose if they adapt him well from the comics. He just felt kinda empty and kinda cookie-cuttery? Considering the issues that have since arisen around Mr Majors, I bet Marvel are kicking themselves that they didn't at least HINT at any versions of Kang that aren't wearing Majors' face...I'm not yet ready to write Marvel off completely, but this mess does have me less willing to blindly throw my money at whatever they release into cinemas.","

"MiroslavKyuranov","15 February 2023","""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!","

"ethanbresnett","18 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film.","

"stephenmadden1982","22 August 2023","I blame myself as everytime I think I will give the MCU another go I end up even more disappointed with their latest cash in on the brands they successfully established prior to the End Game.The previous ant man films were fun with plenty of humour, the latest offering was in the main devoid of humour and followed a dull formulaic plot which felt like a poor rip off of many films that had preceded it including Star Wars. There is some great acting talent in the film all of it was wasted though. Jonathan Majors was decent in it though, albeit the post credits scene almost ruined that. All in all it suggests that it's about time that Disney ended the continued pursuit of the MCU which has long been past it's best. Sadly until audiences stop buying into it they will continue to roll out the same rubbish.","

But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random. But for those who are not so attached to the perfect marvel story. It's great. I would definitely give it a go. I watched it in 3D and CGI and effects were also pretty good.

Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+.","

"jharbert-47785","19 February 2023","A lot of sci-fi these days worries about being grounded more in known science. Concerned with being picked apart by the internet and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I really enjoyed that Quatumania does more of that old school 70s style weirdness while still having things that hint at the science that inspired it. There are crazy creatures, landscapes and communities all over the place. It put me in the mind of something like 'Flash Gordon'(1980) and that's exactly what I've been hoping for from an Ant-man film.It's not Oscar bait, but it's fun with a cool world that they play in. The cast is entertaining and Johnathan Majors especially, is fantastic as Kang. The film does start to tie all the strings Marvel has been placing together. Which gives what is a popcorn flick a bit more weight.All in all, for me it was what I expected and hoped for.Note: there are two end credits scenes.","

"Ltufano23","31 August 2023","The Ant-Man films have always been a fun, easy going section of the MCU. When all the madness is ensuing in other corners, Ant-Man is still hanging around, having a zany adventure. Here, at the start of Phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp defend the MCU, through the Quantum Realm. Like the rest, this installation of Ant-Man does a great job of having fun, creating emotional familial bonds, and doing fun and creative things with size. Taking place almost completely in the Quantum Realm, we see a lot of incredible visual, but also some lackluster CGI as well. It's no secret that this movie was edited last minute to make changes to its climax and I believe that is where this suffers the most. Kang was a phenomenal and truly menacing villain, but it takes away from that when he loses completely and the heroes immediately go back to everyday life. I can't help but feel that a better version of this film sits on the cutting room floor and will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, that is par for the course of some modern comic book flicks as editing has become the most nefarious villain of all.","

Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.","

"satyajittsoren","18 February 2023","The movie sets up the future of MCU but as an individual story it's not that great. The storyline is too obvious and no elements of suprise & twist. From acting point of view the movie looses its string on emotional pov, especially the father - daughter chemistry of Scott & Cassy. Acting of Jonathan Majors is on point, just what you expect from a such high profile actor.The world building of Quantum realm is gorgeous. Good camera work & direction. The action scenes are good but the side characters are got shadowed.Overall an one time watch. The movie has 2 post credit scenes and both are important for future.","

"mariannealindsell","1 July 2023","Disappointing, I'm sorry to say.I'm actually a big fan of the Ant-Man series; I like the first two, and I had hoped for better in this one.First of all, the acting was fine, and Jonathan Majors was great choice for Kang.The effects were also accomplished. Even the pace was good.The title was the single worst thing about this film; ""Quantumania"" implies some delving into or exploration of quantum effects. I could discern no meaningful connection with quantum effects at all, unless you count the ""probability storm"", whatever that is.The film refers to 'the quantum realm' as if it were a separate place from reality, which you could visit.I did read a comic strip years ago about atoms being like miniature worlds, inhabited by militaristic aliens who somehow escaped into the macro world and caused mayhem. As a fantasy comic strip, that kind of worked, especially as much less was known about subatomic level physics in those days.But the physical feel and production design of this film doesn't even feel like it has a connection with subatomic physics, - even a fantasy one.It comes across more as a kind of fairyland, or (if I'm feeling generous) as belonging to a parallel spacetime continuum.So, apart from introducing Kang the Conqueror, and the bit with the ants, the storyline is nonsense.Also, I felt that the whole concept of being able to shrink or grow with the aid of technology was not used well.Of course we all suspend disbelief when watching MCU movies, as we did with the original comic-strips, but one of the beauties of the MCU films is that they give these fantasies physical form, and make it seem almost as if they could exist in the real world.This film treats the shrink/grow technology as a 'blink of the eye'/'click of the fingers' affair, more like the waving of a magic wand than the activation of a technology. It is the poorer for this.I hope the Ant-man series runs to a 4th film, but also that it avoids these let-downs.Most of all, please avoid the use of terms like 'Quantum' or 'Multiverse' unless you intend to show some actualisation or representation of the science concepts behind these terms.And please may we have a sci-fi element to the story, rather than just some random, disconnected fantasy?","

"cinephile-007","17 February 2023","Quantamania is a typical marvel movie with grand visuals and a story that has pretty much nothing to offer.Katheryn Newtown seems like a good choice for Cassie lang. Let's hope she has more to offer in the future.As for the story,it gives us the first look at much anticipated Kang the Conqueror and Jonathan Majors has done a phenomenal job in potraying the big bad. But after all those build-ups and hype surrounding Kang as the big bad for this saga, i kinda felt they downplayed him in the movie. For someone as powerful as Kang to go down like that seemed like an injustice to the character.Overall, quantamania is a fun watch but is forgettable once you walk out the theatres. Jonathan Majors is the stand out of the film and am excited for what he holds in the future.","

No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis.

"Muhammad29","19 February 2023","This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy.","

Why are they continuing to suck the joy out of this universe by focussing on the boring Multiverse?This was a derivative, disappointing waste of time - and I really wish I'd stayed home and watched ""Everything, Everywhere"" again instead.Competent acting, and some nice effects save it from a lower score - however I suspect I'm being kind because I enjoyed the opening 5 minutes.There is no character development snd (even worse) a wafer thin narrative that's been thrown together simply to hang some bloated special effects off. In truth it reminded me of Star Wars parts 1-3. A boring, disappointing and predictable film.","

"amwilburn-60131","22 March 2023","We went in not knowing what to expect, and we probably enjoyed it more as a result. It's a fun film; fitting with the tone of the first two.I have 2 gripes with this film, both cast related. First off, without Michael Pena, this isn't quite as funny. He stole the a lot of the scenes in the first 2 films. Also, I get why they recast the excellent Abby Ryder Fortson for Endgame (the actress would have been too young to play Cassie Lang for the 2023 time frame of Endgame (Emma Fuhrmann, 17 at the time of filming, fit Cassie's MCU age of 16 better, and actually resembled an older Fortson), so *that recasting* made sense. But in the time-frame of Quantumania (which takes places in 2025) Cassie's supposed to be 18, Furman was 21, but definitely could've played 18. Instead they recast someone even older... Katherine Newton was 25 during shooting, doesn't resemble the other 2 Cassies, nor quite as good an actress.Still, tons of action, comedy (that's funny within the context of the situation), and a mysterious backstory (but really only
mysterious if you haven't been watching the Disney+ MCU shows). It's a joyride, never a dull moment, although sometimes the plot meandered. It was nice that Janet and Hank got a lot more to do this time around.Modok (scene during the trailers) makes sense within the context of the MCU, Majors is appropriately mancing as Kang. I don't know what's with the low Rotton Tomatoes, I can't wait to see this again.A-, 9.1/103D: 3D usually doesn't work in dark movies (which was the downfall of both Wakanda Forever & Malificent's 3D), but surprisingly works here... when it matters. Scenes where the 3D wouldn't do much to enhance the experience, the 3D was practically non-existent. For scenes where it would make a difference, the stereoscopic imagining was pretty good (I noticed only 1 brief scene where the depth frustrums didn't line up creating a double image in the mid background, otherwise it was always clean)6.5/10 for the 3D. By comparison Shang Chi's was a 10/10, Wakanda Forever's 3D was a 3/10.","

"Eric266","4 June 2023","I finally watched this movie last night. I've read all the reviews and seen several YouTube videos bashing this movie, so I was not expecting much. Despite this, I was still quite entertained.Scott Lang is living his best life with his girlfriend, Hope, his daughter, Cassie, and father- and mother-in-law , Hank and Janet. Then his daughter inadvertently opens a portal to the quantum realm and all five are sucked into it. They find a realm that is teeming with an entire universe inhabited by diverse characters, including a cameoed Bill Murray. The inhabitants are fighting against a dictator, Kang, who wants to leave the quantum realm and take over our universe.This has all been done before, for better or worse, by Star Wars. Some of the characters are interesting and some even have decent scenes, but its a little too much CGI and not enough heart like the other Ant-man movies. That is my biggest issue with this. Ant-man is supposed to kind of palate cleanser for the darker elements of the MCU, but its darker than the previous two movies and it doesn't really feel like an Ant-man movie. There is a serious element of girl-power as well, but its done properly and feels organic, not forced, which was refreshing.This is a visually stunning movie and Kang is a decent villain, but he doesn't have the same menace as Thanos. Kang mostly just screams in anger as opposed to having that simmering anger and focus of purpose that inhabited Thanos.","

However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past.

"alindsayal","19 February 2023","We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10.","

"vinniec-53536","22 February 2023","In Marvel Studios' 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', our favorite pint-sized (and occasionally giant-sized) hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and co. Are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, 'Quantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the 'Ant-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'. It's a fun, extremely comic book-y (in a good way) family adventure through an intriguing sci-fi world, and I definitely had a good time watching.","

"Scarefish","10 September 2023","Well, they've finally managed it.The first Ant-Man nearly had good character moments, it crippled itself with the ever-so-apparent ""funny problem"" that has been plaguing Marvel's films for many years now. The sequel had much better spectacle - it was genuinely stunning at times; it's nearly enough to let me ignore the heavy Flanderization of all of our established characters. Now we have the third movie, and somehow we've ended up with the worst of both worlds.The characters have lost all sense of individuality and urgency that they had in the first film, or what little of it they had back then. The ensemble plays off as that of a mid-day American sitcom, and not one of the ones that anybody really emjoys sitting down and watching actively. Full scenes dedicated to Scott's asides are not even the least bit funny as every joke is incredibly obvious and surface-level, oddly sandwiching the film with an incredibly cringe-worthy opening and ending that feel entirely useless. I don't think I have been so disengaged with any piece of media since I saw The Emoji Movie, though there are some sequences where this film at least creeps up to just being plain bad rather than abusively lazy. Scott has pics taken with peoples' dogs, he gets mistaken for Spider-Man, and he has a Hollywood-style panic attack that ends in an anti-climax that thinks it's much funnier than it is. These are the most memorable bits of the story due to their placement at the most crucial sections of the film, and that plays a huge role in sinking this movie's rating for me. It's like they wanted to numb viewers going into the film's first act, and then Sucker Punch them right at the end. This film is creative anaesthesia.Somehow, with so much special effects and so much money dumped into it, this film manages to be the ugliest film in all of the MCU. I'm sure the special effects actually made the film worse. They spent countless resources ruining their sub-par film to turn it into one of the worst films I've seen in years. M. O. D. O. K. Is shocking; there was a time when Marvel was churning out visually stunning films back-to-back. Even if the other elements of the films were lacking, you could at least rely on popcorn entertainment, but not here. For the first time in the MCU I'm replused by the special effects more often than not - this was trending with some underbaked effects in Black Panther and Black Widow, but I didn't expect it to get to this point so quickly. This feels more like a low-budget TV film managing to seem bigger than it should be through clever effects, but it's a huge big-budget Hollywood film that's crippled by sloppy effects and messy environments through the vast majority of the film. I can only imagine this is due to a lack of cohesive, or decent, artistic direction; the incredibly poor money management on display here is insulting. I've never seen a better example of how bloated film budgets are on the verge of destroying the film industry as a whole, and by this point I'm almost hoping for it to happen already. After the pandemic we just got out of, the last thing we need are thousands of unincredible films that think they're worth our time. At a certain point I just have to say enough is enough and file for a divorce from corporate films.Quantumania turns the infinitesimal quantum realm into a busy mess nearly as sloppy as its slapdash script.I guess the team behind Quantumania just didn't quite understand what ""less is more"" really means.","

"Prismark10","22 April 2023","Given Disney's takeover of 20th Century Fox meant they got an insight of the expanding world of James Cameron's new Avatar movie.Quantumania is very much set in a CGI heavy multiverse. Ant-Man begins in a lighthearted way until Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has to spring his teenage activist daughter from the police cells.It seems Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to explore the Quantum Realm with a newly built device. This is bad news as far as Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is concerned. She spent decades inside there and has harboured some secrets about it.Before the latest experiment is shut down, they are transported inside the weird, wonderful psychedelic world of the Quantum Realm. They meet an old friend of Janet, Lord Krylar (Bill Murray.)Now things have changed, everyone is afraid of Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors.) He once saved Janet until she found out what kind of person he really was.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is light and frothy. It has all the nourishment value of a McDonalds Thick Shake. It is CGI heavy made in the new fangled virtual production StageCraft set.The story is very much the kind of seen it before in superhero movies. I even knew it would have an offbeat intro and song before the movie started.The film introduces Kang but this all powerful enemy underwhelmed in his main outing.","

If Janet Van Dyne spent 30 years in the Quantum Realm, why in the name of everything holy or unholy would you build any connection back to the quantum realm??? The plot is thinner than saran wrap. It's not even funny. At all. It's just there. Taking up two hours of your existence you'll never get back. Thankfully I didn't pay two cents to see this turkey in the theater. Worst villain of all time in any Marvel film. He is stale, bland, and a combination of ever villain in every rotten Sci-Fi film. Stop making these movies. You've jumped the shark. The MODOK character is laughable in all the wrong ways. From the dialogue to his appearance. Spend a few shekels to at least make the film visually appealing. You don't care if they ever get out. Watch it once on Disney plus if you must but never watch it again.","

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","19 February 2023","I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me.","

"dschlatter","18 May 2023","I was sceptical, when the first Ant-Man came out. But man, did that movie entertain. Paul Rudd's charm and the supporting cast carried a (let's be honest) fairly riddiculous premise and made it work.So imagine my joy when part two was just as good. But then, Marvel had to weave movies together and every movie had to be part if some bigger scheme. I like standalone movies that just tell a good story. I don't appreciate that a villain is ""introduced"" so he can re-appear in some other franchise. And enough with the bloody multiverse. What a drag. Dr. Strange, Loki, Ant-Man, Spiderman..,
Ant-Man worked in the real world, much like Spiderman used to work. 90% blue screen does not do the characters or the movie any favors. It's just a boring mess of flashy images and lights.Take it down a notch, Marvel. You are losing that speacial ingredient that made for great movies. Don't make me switch to DC, please.","

"danchilton-71955","23 February 2023","The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants.","

"rajvignesh-60140","27 February 2023","This has been a usual marvel movie with all the commercial elements, a simple story with all techs and depth in that. The whole ant family has performed very well. It has fights talks etc. The usual ant man movie things with some humour to be kudos. It could have been different a bit but the movie has been reall usual nothing new. The one thing was kang , oh boy he is just master of conquerer. But such a strong villain been killed in a snap. But i hope something more to come in the future. Kang will return with bang. I am supporting a antogonist for the first time. Paul actually he is been a side stay, kang and janet being the main role played . But he just did justice to the role. It was entirely dominated by kang. As always a happy end to the movie. The main attraction in the post credit never miss it to watch it. Its really mindblowing, i dont want to spoil it. Please do watch it in theaters. A good start to phase 5.","

"jelenamnr","26 February 2023","The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors.","

"johnnyhbtvs27","17 February 2023","Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come.","

"basementbrotherscollectibles","18 February 2023","Positives: Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Paul Rudd are good and familiar. They carry the film. Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down."" There is even a line about ants being highly developed socialists and that we humans could learn from them.","

"adamlennard","21 February 2023","I really did enjoy this film, mainly due to some very good acting and a fun story and a pretty good villain. In terms of the MCU this will probably rank somewhere in the middle which shows just how good the MCU can be. Paul Rudd is perfect as Antman as usual but I personally really enjoyed Michael Douglas performance. Will it win any awards? Probably not, did it keep me entertained? Absolutely and at the end of the day I'm a firm believer movies are about having fun and enjoying yourself and this quite simply is a lot of fun. As mentioned before one big strength is the films villain one area the MCU struggles is it's bad guys and I'm pleased to say Kang is one of the better ones with an interesting motive the fact Antman himself questions if defeating Kang was the right things is an unique wrinkle.","

"nscoby93","19 February 2023","With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10

"marveltstodd","17 February 2023","What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!","

"thape-d","15 February 2023","The movie is good in respect to the fact that it continues to build upon everything established in the previous films regarding the quantum realm and Janet van dyne's story. The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it. Also hoping for more involvement from Scott in the future.Ant-man and the wasp only in name.","

"Shaunmatthewc","23 May 2023","Wow, where to begin. Basically so many Marvel films after Endgame have been completely forgettable. Ant-Man 3 is no different. I expected the Quantum Realm to be more wacky and out there just like I expected Doctor Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness to have well more Multiverse. The story seemed very bland to me, it was entertaining but nothing new, we've seen it all a million times before. It doesn't help that some of the story seemed like a carbon copy of Tron Legacy. Scott Lang was missing his heist team here and it shows, the film falls flat without them appearing. Kang is supposed to be bigger and harder than Thanos but was almost a complete throwaway. Watch if you've got nothing better to do but I wouldn't go out my way to see it. Marvel need to do better!","

"BandSAboutMovies","18 February 2023","As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie.","

"gatorgus48","5 June 2023","Way too much CGI. It's overwhelming and distracting. Probably just as well because the dialogue was poor.The actor who played Kang was the only good thing about the movie. However, he has to be one of the dumbest 'supervillains' on screen.Why didn't he just take off their suits when he had captured them? Or even just kill them. But no, he had to 'Doctor Evil' it.In addition, the idea he didn't notice a million fricken ants in his domain is absurd.Further, why he could build that huge empire but couldn't figure out how to shrink the power source without her is also absurd.And Kang was somehow able to get away from a million ants, but couldn't beat Paul Rudd in a fight.The dialogue was atrocious and making Michael Douglas look young was well done, but disturbing in an odd way.I feel it actually made me dumber for having watched it.","

Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that.","

Every new character in MCU(usually it's kids( of Clint and Scott for example)) makes fun of real guys that we know from films before, while being totally brainless childish clowns, that just don't listen to anything. Multiverse saga i believe should extend the lore, make the whole story broader, but it just ended up being the most unbelievable senseless thing thay i've ever saw. P. S. Even before, i would say marvel got cool movies as an exception, big exception( like first Iron Man or Homecoming) but as for now it is literally worse than anyone could've imagined.

"brentsbulletinboard","20 February 2023","If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases.","

"scootm16","18 February 2023","Where do I even start with this boring, exposition-drenched Star Wars wannabe?I guess I'll start at when I knew the movie was going to be trash. At the beginning of the movie, Ant-Man has to go down to the local police station to pick up his daughter from jail. She was arrested because the police were tasked with clearing out a homeless encampment (in reality, encampments are a serious crime issue on the West coast), but Ant-Man's daughter didn't like that, so she destroyed police equipment. The next scene at dinner, Hank Pym said he would've marched in there and broken her out of jail. Why is Marvel pushing anti-policing/anti-justice and having a teenage girl as their ""martyr"" or spokesperson or whatever. Shouldn't the Marvel heroes be working together with the police to stop crime? What is this leftist gibberish? I have grown to expect this from Marvel after the Disney acquisition, but man were the politics extra loud in this movie.Regardless of the extreme leftist political pandering written by someone who is completely detached from actual society and the real world being forced onto us, the movie was still trash. Kang was an absolute joke of a villain in this movie. I have no idea how they plan(ned) on making him the new big bad, someone on Thanos's level after what I just saw. The action was so boring and drab because you know everyone's going to be fine. There's no sense of danger or risk that something won't go as planned. So many scenes and sets were just blatantly ripped from A New Hope it's honestly pathetic.I know Disney owns Marvel and Star Wars, but keep them separate. Let them have their own feel to them, like back when the first Avengers came out. That movie had its own unique feel/aura and has aged extremely well. Marvel movies are now too busy pandering to politics to tell an interesting story with real fleshed out characters dealing with serious issues that have consequences. It feels like every Marvel movie is trying to be Thor Ragnarok now, and that only spells disaster.I'm more sad than mad. I thought this movie looked decent from the trailers too. After this, I don't think the days of actual quality films like Iron Man or Avengers are coming back, not from Disney.The most criminal thing about this movie is they somehow even made Paul Rudd unlikable.2/10.","

"shoebsaad","24 April 2023","It was a decent comic book ""Save the Universe"" movie. It had decent visual FX (I expected more for a film with a 200M budget) and has the humor you'd expect with Paul Rudd. Besides that, the movie is the weirdest and maybe the most unsatisfying MCU movie until now. It reminded me of Thor: Love and Thunder but with ants and a different story. The Story was all over the place. The whole movie is written like a Rick and Morty episode. Jeff Loveness is a talented sci-fi comedy writer, but his script struggles to make the characters distinct or take anything seriously.""Quantumania"" works on one fundamental level, setting up Kang the Conqueror as a formidable and ruthless villain for the upcoming Avengers movie, ""Avengers: Kang Dynasty,"" The movie's highlight is Jonathan Majors's role as Kang the Conqueror. His Kang was fantastic and pretty close to the comics, at least in terms of appearance.Overall I feel like this movie was just a very long TV episode. With that said, after the next Marvel films come out, I think I will go back and realize how important and good this film really was 😂.6.5/10.","

There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang.","

"jcfuller-00305","22 February 2023","One of the most fun and weird movies I've seen in a while, which is mostly a compliment. I liked it! It was fun! I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of creatively new designs the quantum realm yielded, the probability storm scene in particular was one of my favorite MCU movie sequences of the past couple years. It really felt like a colorful comic book come to life. The blobby guy was a scene-stealer, though obviously he didn't reach the sheer comedic prowess of Luis, who was missed here. The Pym-Lang family were a great cast of characters to watch and even if the other 2 Ant-Man films may be the better two because of the tonal difference, it was still interesting to see them face a larger-scale threat, and the final battle of the civilians and the heroes versus Kang's army felt very tense and exciting....where has Jonathan Majors been the past decade?? This man can act like nobody's business. Kang was easily one of the best parts of the movie, his backstory with Janet was really intriguing and his unrelenting coldness in his methods was chilling, as was his massive displays of power. It'll be awesome to see him again down the road. MODOK was cool and funny, until his mask came off and I felt as though someone had poured sodium chloride into my eyeballs. Bill Murray was good but underused. I wished there was a little more time spent in San Fransisco (Jimmy Woo!) it felt like we had just barely re-established the characters before they were thrown into the quantum realm. Also, the second trailer for this movie made it seem as though Kang was going to tempt Scott with helping him regain time with Cassie that he lost over the blip, with dialogue that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the Final Cut discussing it (Kang even tells Janet at one point that he could send her back before she ever left her own family). I'm surprised they didn't go this route in the movie, instead having Kang's end of the bargain only being to not kill all of them. Overall though, the movie was really fun, weird, and visually pleasing, and a great time at the movies. The stakes felt higher than most MCU movies since we know Kang is going to be the next big villain and it felt like anything could happen with the timeline.Now, my opinion on the MCU movie prejudice that seems to be growing and growing: People keep dissing on these movies because they're not as 'refined' or something as other movies out there, but It's unfair to compare completely different genres with each other. People that want to say the MCU is too ""VFX heavy"" or ""Unserious"" need to realize that that's exactly what these types of movies are here to provide for audiences: a colorful, funny, adventurous story filled with superpowered heroes that fight evil. And audiences eat it up every time, it's clear that MCU movies are connecting with the general moviegoing public because every single release is a hit (some smaller than others, but still successful) and people keep coming back for more. Those who want to take shots at the aspects of MCU movies that are integral parts of MCU movies should just watch something else. I completely understand disliking these movies if one thinks they contain weaker superhero stories or weaker VFX or weaker comedy than usual, but one can't complain about it the existence of these different aspects in general when they're just pillars of what makes an MCU movie that people keep on coming back to for more. Sure, Quantumania wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a perfectly satisfying and fun romp through a superhero-filled world, which is exactly what I expected from it. If I wanted a movie without these aspects, I wouldn't watch it. Hope that made sense, and here's to more fun MCU outings.*exhales* but anyways, cool film. OWEN WILSON!!!!!!!!!","

"ThereelscoopwithKK","21 February 2023","From someone who enjoyed Thor Love and Thunder while others detested it this movie took it to a whole new level of awful for me. I enjoyed the first 2 Ant Man movies. There was something comforting to the humble Paul Rudd playing Ant man. The characters all fit in perfectly with a simple story. Nothing spectacular, but simple , comedic, and worthwhile.This one on the other hand totally sacrificed Ant Man's character to serve as exposition and did a poor job with that. The characters themselves all felt like different people. Hank Pym feels uninspired , Hope goes along for the ride, and Ant Man is the opposite of his old humble persona which I loved before. His character served as some relief in the past for the other bombastic Marvel personalities. The casting of Cassie doesn't quite fit well with me either.This movie felt like a combination of the worst parts of Spy Kids 3D, Star Wars , and Sharkboy and Lava girl. There was a lot of opportunity to do much more with the quantum realm and this just felt like no effort was put into it. The sets themselves look like they were made in an early 2000s movie. At one point someone in the theaters chair broke and instead of laughing at the movie the audience got amusement out of that.For all the build up nothing ever quite adds up in the story. The one saving grace is that Jonathan Majors is a high quality actor. Even with his skill set they still nearly ruined him with a full and uninspiring script. I came into this so excited after how they concluded Loki season 1, but what a let down.They are going to need another stellar Loki season to try to get this phase back on track. I hope they don't spoil Guardians for me as well with their final send off not long from now.","

"gavinp9","15 February 2023","'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending.","

"juergenmeyerdrentwede","24 June 2023","How to start? This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad that i am struggling to find words which would not result in a cancellation of this comment. I can not believe that this movie is made by the same studio that made Endgame or Avengers or even She Hulk! It is basically 2+ hours of lifeless CGI porn with a story that is an insult to viewers above the age of six. I would state that the writing is lazy, but that would be an insult to all the lazy writers out there. The moments in the storytelling that actually show some kind of inspiration are less than a minute in combination. The rest is utter and complete waste. You have an ursupator equipped with an army capable of conquering complete worlds? No Problemo, just let an angry teenager hold a 10-second-speech and the mob will rise and overcome. The antagonist is an organism designed only for killing? Just make him the worst possible fighter and let him change his mind by the snap of a finger.Actually, if this is the storytelling of modern Hollywood, i can't wait for AI to write movies. It can not be worse than this.","

"Hermione_Mertcan","19 February 2023","7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful.","

"shrivastavshubhanshu","22 April 2023","This movie is one of those movies which has all the hype but no substance, just like the quantum realm around us. It seemed that the writers wrote the script while being high. For example -1. Quantum size, really? They are smaller than subatomic particles. Do writers even understand what that means? I highly doubt it. To simplify, they are smaller than the particles found within an atom. So how are they breathing when they are smaller than a single atom of oxygen?2. Kang is the destroyer of multiverses, as explained in the movie. Now again, do writers really understand what the scale of that is? A destroyer of multiverses is defeated in a boxing match by Ant man and wasp at the end. Really? That's absurd and plain dumb. A grave insult to audience's intelligence. Shooting lasers is not exactly a multiverse destroying ability now is it!3. The previous movies showed good chemistry between Ant man and his daughter, who by the way has become SO annoying in this movie - an obnoxious brat would be more accurate a description. And why is she a genius? Can't any kids of superheroes be normal teenagers? She creates quantum device in her garage. I literally wanted to bang my head on the wall.4. The CGI. It is awful. Everywhere I looked there were a multitude of colors. It made me dizzy and sick.5. The first movie showed ant man using a single pym particle to bring himself back from the quantum state. They had a bunch of them in this movie, why couldn't they just do that? Lazy scriptwriting.6. MODOK. No words. It was cringe AH. From a worthy villain in comics and cartoons to this pathetic monstrosity.There are many more reasons but these are the major ones and will suffice for now. The movie seemed like it had quarter-hearted effort (not even half-hearted) by everyone who was involved. It looked like they just wanted to get over this project somehow. The end result was audience being served rubbish.","

"siderite","4 May 2023","I should start this review with the ending of the movie. After saving the world - again - Ant-Man is asking himself hard questions, like did he doom the entire Multiverse or not. He goes ""Nah, it's fine"" reminding himself that the world doesn't make sense and we shouldn't be asking so many questions. It was a clear jab at the people who would predictably criticize the film for its lack of meaning or consistency. It's also an advice for viewers going in, if they want to enjoy the film: leave your brain at the door.That being said, the film was a bunch of familiar faces playing characters that didn't seem to fit their history in a full CGI dream world. That is it. The movie could have just as well been an Alice in Wonderland sequel, where she shrinks and grows using magic mushrooms to kill a multiversal Red Queen. It makes no difference whatsoever.So was the film entertaining? Barely. The visuals were nice, things went pew pew and boom, had a lot of McGuffins and Deus ex Machinas, we even had entire CGI bars (and some actors) borrowed from whatever Marvel are doing in Star Wars. The story was clear, too, as nonsensical as it was. The characterization was bad, though. I mean Evangeline Lilly was barely in it (the haircut did NOT help), MODOK as Darren was pointless, Cassie was annoying as hell - that girl needs a good spanking - not taking responsibility for anything and then telling people what they should do, and Hank... Michael Douglas came, did his lines like a professional, went back home and got drunk questioning his life choices. Even Ant-Man was swinging wildly from courageous dad to hysterical buffoon. Paul Rudd did what he could with it, but it was bad.That leaves Kang. I have to say that I have a feeling every time I see Jonathan Majors on screen. It's a creepy, filthy feeling. It does not feel good. I don't know why and probably I will never know, with the personal issues the actor has nowadays and the publicity around it. But he was a good Kang. Better than in Loki, that's for sure, his acting was spot on. I feel like the script did him a disservice, because he could have easily become one of those legendary villains that makes you root for while hating him at the same time. I didn't see it in Loki, but I did see the potential of a great villain in this film. With the expected two end-credits scenes completely shattering that potential.The classic comic book villain histrionics have got to go. They don't help stories, they don't inspire anyone watching, they don't provide any useful hint for real life just a small emotional catharsis that feels shameful at the end, like a bad wank. It's a made-up fantasy of the bad guy emotionally collapsing under the weight of their defeat while heroes somehow derive strength from theirs. Is it that hard to care for your villain as you do for your hero, writers?""Kang will return"", says the last image of the film. I now doubt that very much.Bottom line: a forgettable and completely pointless film that manages to be somehow entertaining based almost exclusively on CGI and the charisma of the (poorly used) actors. Alas, that's the standard of movie I now expect from Marvel.","

Chris Hemsworth, Idris Elba, Thomas Hiddleston, Chris Evans, Chris Pratt, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan (who I waited for a break out role since 'The Covenant'). I will encompass my entire review of this movie with the following statement: It wasn't bad per se. (Let's remember that: Per se is a Latin phrase literally meaning ""by itself."". It has the sense of "" intrinsically ,"" or "" in and of itself). So yeah... It wasn't bad Per Se.","

No.Overall it's a really fun film, happy to see ant man have a third instalment and join that legendary class for marvel.Good adventure film, great action, great comedy and great family film!!Paul Rudd delivers yet again, as his most iconic role as Scott Lang. He finally reaches the level of respect in the MCU. Of course marvel changed the actress and Google it but she only found out on social media she was being recast.. but Cassie was good and the relationship was cool.This film is basically an ant man titled movie about kang tbe conquerer.They didn't do him ultimate and true justice IMO as if they went clear comic book the outcome would be vastly different. But Jonathan majors is Kang aka he who remains aka lol you get it. This will be amazing once the story is complete but they need to make him a true threat..Overall 6/10. Without going into details.

All he can is building B-Level storm troopers. And shoot laser that vaporizes people.The Stormtroopers did nothing.

"sepetcenk","23 April 2023","This movie demonstrates that no matter how much money you pour into a bad idea and attempt to build something around it, it is ultimately futile. We are all drawn towards the gravitational pull of the postmodern approach in every art form, and while it's understandable to want to appear postmodern, the filmmakers seem to have struggled with grasping the concept of postmodern narration. It's disheartening to witness the amateur directing mistakes, and even the actors appear to be confused. It's truly incredible how this film came to be. It's as if Marvel was purchased by a third-world company and produced a movie solely to impress themselves. While the storyline may make sense to younger viewers, it falls short for true Marvel fans.","

"CinemaClown","13 June 2023","The 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the commencement of their Phase 5 slate and it couldn't have started on the worst possible note. Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is a lifeless & lacklustre entry that has the ambition but not the vision to bring its quantum universe to life with any cinematic flair and isn't just the weakest of the three Ant-Man films but is arguably the worst offering in the shared universe.Directed by Peyton Reed, the story finds Scott Lang & his family accidentally transported to the quantum realm where they discover a new threat. All the elements that made its predecessors fun, lighthearted & small-scale adventures is gone in this latest outing as it comes packed with terrible visuals, cringe writing, uninspiring action & bland storytelling. Even the world building & character designs have a juvenile quality to them.Strongly abiding by the Marvel formula and deficient in even the basic filmmaking aspects, the film never manages to create any sort of intrigue or interest despite the uncharted territory the plot takes place in. The dialogues are atrocious, its attempts at humour fall flat every time and the performances are mediocre at best. Much is said about Jonathan Majors' impressive input but his work stands out only coz the rest are much worse.Overall, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest eyesore from the crumbling franchise that's been on a downhill journey for some time now and may have just hit its lowest point with their latest run-of-the-mill garbage. A disappointment on all fronts despite my low expectations and an embarrassing piece of blockbuster entertainment, Quantumania is an empty spectacle and an early contender for the worst film of the year. A new low for Marvel Studios.","

This film ruins what you liked about the first two films and just see that it got turned into a bland and boring film about characters trying to stop the new supposed villain of the MCU and it also makes an interesting comic book villain Modok become a joke and one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a superhero movie.","

"IonicBreezeMachine","18 May 2023","After helping defeated Thanos and saved the universe, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has become a celebrity with a best selling book and made up for lost time with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). During dinner at the home of love interest Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the recently returned Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie showcases a device that can map the Quantum Realm where Janet was lost by sending signals which Janet is none too happy about for reasons she doesn't share. The device opens up a worm hole sucking in Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet sending them to the Quantum Realm with Scott and Cassie in one area and Hope, Hank, and Janet in another, where they soon find themselves caught between a resistance between the denizens of the Quantum Realm and the tyrannical despot Kang the Conqueror (Johnathan Majors) who has a connection to Janet.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man series and the first film in the fifth phase of the MCU. The third Ant-Man movie was intended from its inception to be larger scale with director Peyton Reed stating his intention was ""a massive world-building undertaking"" citing the aesthetics of Heavy Metal magazines as an influence. You can't fault Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania for its ambition, but in execution it has many of the flaws of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness without some of the redeeming points that compensated for that film's messy screenplay.I will say once again Paul Rudd is good as Ant-Man with his likable down to earth charm making him an endearing presence in this universe. I also liked Kathryn Newton as Scott's daughter Cassie with the two having a nice natural chemistry and still building on the father/daughter dynamic that has been a strong emotional core of this franchise. The movie is also a bright and colorful film with lots of details and some inspired setpieces such as a scene involving multiple possible versions of Scott Lang or hyperintelligent ants but unfortunately the story and the nuts and bolts are where we begin to see the weaknesses. Quantumania is much more serious minded entry for Ant-Man in the same way that Thor: Ragnarok was a tonal departure from the prior Thor movies, but where it worked there by refreshing the character, here the tonal shift feels like it takes out a major part of the Ant-Man movie's appeal. The movie also has way too much stuffed into it as it's more focused on setting up Kang the Conqueror than exploring the Quantum Realm and while the Quantum Realm looks visually interesting, there's not much world building and the denizens of the realm they introduce just sort of get overtaken by the visual noise that makes this feel less like an Ant-Man movie and more like a Star Wars clone. We also have Corey Stoll returning as Darren Cross who is now M. O. D. O. K. And it's honestly a lateral move as he was underwhelming as a character in the first film and he's not much more interesting here.Quantumania isn't the worst MCU movie, but it's definitely one of the lower ranking entries in that it's so stuffed without much development on its own story and more focused on setting up plot points for other films. It's perfectly serviceable even if not particularly exceptional.","

"stevemajor-75327","19 February 2023","""Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was a decent movie. If you like Marvel movies you'll probably like this one.Jonathan Majors was the shining star of Movie. He gives just a perfect tease of what could be possible in the future with Kang.Kathryn Newton did a great job of playing a younger hero that just wants to be respected.Paul Rudd was his normal funny charming self.Visually this movie looked amazing. They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M. O. D. O. K he could have been so much more in a different project.","

"moviemanmo","18 February 2023","The introduction into the Quantum realm really gave me Star Wars vibes and I would say that's a good thing. The character designs were great. The plot and backstory for why things were happening was explained well and easy to follow. All the characters from the previous films played their roles well.As far as new characters, Kang was excellent. Though he didn't show off too much of his powers. I wasn't expecting him to so I wasn't disappointed. I would say towards the end, the film did make him seem a bit weak. Great character played by a great actor nonetheless.Modok could have been better. His initial look was fine but once his true identity was revealed that's when he looked weird. They could have done with working on that CGI or not show that version of him that many times once they showed who he truly was. He was used too much for comedic relief and towards the end it was a bit much.The action in the film was entertaining but nothing over the top.The dialogue and forced comedy towards the end is what brings this movie down a bit. There were bits of dialogue/scenes that could have been taken out and the film would have been much stronger. Specifically from Modok and Ant-man's daughter and like one line from Kang.Overall it was another entertaining Ant-man movie that didn't disappoint. Don't believe the Critics, enjoy the film.","

"Cinema-reviewer321","22 April 2023","I liked Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and thought they were both fun Marvel movies. I thought Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) was ok, it could have been better because of some of the problems, but I was entertained when watching it.Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne are all good in the movie. Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang was good, I just wish they gave her better dialogue and things to do, and there were some characters that were not needed in the movie.Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror was great, I thought he was interesting, intimidating, and powerful when you see what he can do and his backstory. There was another villain character that connects to the other Ant-Man movie, I thought he was cool for a bit until they did something to the character that I did not like that much.The look of the Quantum Realm looked cool and believable, and the action scenes were good along with having some weird editing at times. The movie is funny most of the time, and then there are some moments that were not funny, but this movie was entertaining.There are problems that involve how certain things play out, but I though Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) was entertaining, funny, and fun to watch. There are after credit scenes that lead to upcoming movies and an upcoming show that was cool, but I think if you like Ant-Man and Paul Rudd then you will like this movie like the earlier two.","

"namob-43673","16 February 2023","I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that.","

"AngelHonesty","4 June 2023","Its a Kang Movie, not an ant-man movie. The film introduces Kang to us, who I assume is going to be the next big bad, just like Thanos. It's setting up our villain. Not a bad thing at all, but it took away from Ant-man. It felt like this wasn't really his movie, he was just there and so was everyone else. The story felt very rushed. It was all action and very little story telling. They tried to make into this ""big thing"" from Janet's past that she never wanted to talk about. But it was poorly executed and came off almost boring, it had too much foretelling.I loved the Quantum realm itself. The film did a great job showing it and the creatures. But I think it could have dived more into showing the realm and the stories of the creatures. Instead it focused on other things it really didn't need to. But the characters were fun especially the blob with no holes. But all in all, the film is definitely lacking.","

The effects are amazing, my only complaint could be the brightness on some scenes but overall this is one big CGI fest of a movie; and it's done well. There's been some mocking of the plot. It fit, it worked and it kept me interested. Come on...it's another comic movie. It's not to be watched for plot critique, it's meant to be enjoyed. The plot fit, the characters were great. I especially loved the living, protective buildings and wish I could live in one! The villain is good, he's bad, he's super strong but has faults. It's a good movie, worth a watch for some popcorn entertainment.","

"mangoturtle","17 February 2023","This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating.","

"ntrsanchez","19 February 2023","Don't bother going unless you have extra money to spare or you want to sit at a movie for 2 1/2 hours in which nothing consecutively entertaining happens. The humor was so stale that the theater was silent almost the entire time any form of joke was made (attempted)
Plot was terrible and should've been used for another character that isn't AntMan. AntMans character isn't designed for anything heavily intertwined with plot, and he especially isn't someone to use when introducing MCU's new Villain. This movie seems like they just wanted to get AntMans movie out of the way because they had no idea what to do with him.There's no issues with the casting, however, the new writing makes it seem like they're taking two toys from opposing companies and trying to make it work.They also need to bring back Michael Peña - he stole both of the two movies .","

"lschouder-04582","21 February 2023","I really miss the serious and grounded tone of films like Captain America: the Winter Soldier. Lately, Marvel films have been very Disney-fied. Having said that, this film was silly but still pretty good. Johnathan Majors has some really nuanced and powerful acting moments that anchor the movie. Kang is a fantastic villain that was perfectly executed. I was also surprised to find myself feeling sympathy towards MODOK. Who would've ever thought that character would translate well to film, but they pulled it off pretty decently.I also think some of the humor helped as well. I think this film should've ended differently, but all-in-all it wasn't a bad movie. However, going forward I really hope Marvel can get back to being more serious and regain the gravitas that made the Infinity saga so great.","

Don't believe all the bad reviews this movie has been getting I enjoyed it a lot! Let me first say the way I judge sequels is by the villain the first movies are by the main characters but once you start to go deeper into the characters life villains are usually what pop. I loved the first ant-man very funny exciting kind of heist movie. The second tho i didn't care for cause o felt the villain could have been a lot better. Which brings us to this movie. Jonathon Majors steals the show as Kang. He is more deep then we expect. Although this movie kind of lacked the laughs of the first 2 it holds up well. I highly recommend this movie.","

"matthutsonmovie","26 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the highly anticipated third installment in the Ant-Man series from Marvel Studios. Directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, the film delivers on the humor, action, and visual spectacle that fans have come to expect from the franchise. However it seems like the writers and directors are just mix mashing movies together such as Star Wars, referring to Mos Eisley Cantina scene and all of the various aliens you might encounter and other science fiction flicks which is not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't leave much room for originality.The plot of the film centers around the discovery of a new quantum realm, which leads to a host of new challenges and adventures for the characters. Lang must team up once again with Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) to navigate this new realm and save the world from a new threat.One of the strengths of the film is its cast of characters. The chemistry between Rudd and Lilly is as strong as ever, and their banter provides many of the film's comedic highlights. Douglas also delivers a standout performance as the cantankerous Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer's reasons for hiding the truth from her family were not very well developed or reasoned, while Newton brings a fresh energy to the role of Cassie.The quantum realm sequences are visually stunning and provide a trippy and mind-bending experience for the audience. However the CGI seemed low quality in certain aspects where the suits of Ant-Man and the Wasp looks like they were not even really wearing them, you could totally tell that it was CGI. At certain points it look like the film was trying to be Avatar in terms of visuals yet did not stand up to the quality of it. A plus was the action scenes which were well choreographed and exciting, with the use of size-shifting abilities adding an extra layer of creativity to the fight scenes. The film is not without its flaws.The villain, played by Jonathan Majors, is a pretty badass guy and I felt like he was a good villain for this series yet he seemed quite similar to Thanos in terms of his goals. He has his reasons for doing what he wants to do and I feel like this character could be developed even further. As We Know Marvel is planning to expand on this character because The Kang Dynasty film should be coming to theaters in 2025.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It delivers on the humor and action that fans have come to love, while also exploring new territory in the quantum realm. While not without its flaws, the film is a worthy addition to the franchise and is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next adventure of Ant-Man and the Wasp.","

"waltermwilliams","16 February 2023","Why wait for the next instalment of Star Wars episodes when Marvel totally riff on George Lucas imagination in the latest instalment of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", even down to the bar scene.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily respectively as Ant-Man and the Wasp are back for the first time since 2018 in a solo story.This time they are taking the whole family on a teddy bears picnic into the Quantum Realm to deal with the time travelling terror of Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors from ""Lovecraft Country"") and his old mate Darren the Dick (Corey Stoll).So let's turn off our regulators, keep our helmets on and get ready to hear the words Pim Particles and Multiverse thrown around...a lot!Kang of course doesn't walk the time line like the rest of us...he just doesn't do linear.However, he does understand ""variants"" better than Sam Raimi.If you remember ""Honey I Shrunk The Kids"" or any of those corny ""Journey"" movies in the 70's you'll be partly prepared for what you are about to witness.This movie is very trippy and Sci-Fi.It's as if the writer, Jeff Loveness, was testing out illegal substances for a Government funded drug experiment.Watch out for: A wonderful cameo from an Oscar nominated actor making his third comic book role.Plus Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer looking great in her 60's) will air some dirty laundry and dark secrets.In this movie Ant-Man doesn't have to win his battle with Kang.They both just have to lose.It's such a shame to see an Oscar winning actor like Michael Douglas spend most of his time with his hands submerged in a bowl of jelly.This Father-Daughter flick could have easily been a 4 star film for the 31st movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it needed a little less conversation and a little more action please (as Elvis once told me).Stay for the final credits to get a clue as to what's coming in Phase 5 for the Avengers and how it will have a profound impact on the MCU.","

"KFstudios2009","24 August 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a basic space adventure that don't offer anything new. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is way better, and when I watched this movie, I can't really say that I'm impressed. Ant-Man and his family travel to the Quantum Realm and has to defeat the High Emperor Kang. Man, something that has happened a million times, and ok, the visuals were great, that's Marvel's strength, but besides, not so much good. Acting and story was weak, and it was too long. The flashback of the characters was showed badly, they showed it in moments that didn't just feel right to put in there, and the introduction of new characters feeled too fast and rushed. It is surprising that they was so long in one place in the movie, for a space adventure, I think people should travel across many new places. In summary, I didn't take this movie too serious, beside visuals, nothing new to offer, Ant-Man dissapointed.","

It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D.","

Maybe just put Michael Pina back in since he was the funniest part of ant man. This movie even made Paul Rudd look bad which is very difficult to do!Trying not to spoil anything specific, but if you really want to see this, wait until Disney plus, unless you have amc or regal movie pass then I guess you could justify it if you want to waste time or hate yourself or if you like to ""hate watch"" movies.

Maybe I just liked it because there hasnt been any good movies out lately. I loved seeing what the villain was all about. Id rather immerse myself in this CGI world than Avatar. It has some different characters, giving us something other than superheroes and tech. If youre looking for something to trip out on, something like Aquaman, its freaking awesome. The realm feels like when Dr Strange fought Dormammu, which was an wicked scene. When i compare it to the other stuff out there like on TV Carnival Row, Picard, Moon Girl...Quantumania blows them out of the microshpere.","

"deepfrieddodo","26 May 2023","Bringing the wise-cracking Avenger back to centre stage, Quantumania shares the spotlight with the wider Lang/Pym family, in a film that is enjoyable, if not unsuccessful in it's attempt to match the drama of all recent MCU releases. It's fun, but could also be likened to Spy-Kids.A strange tone is struck. The early stages are full of the humour from the previous two instalments, but the main plot is dove into fairly immediately and it doesn't take long for severity to ensue. Having Kang as the villain matches that, but backed up by M. O. D. O. K. Felt like a goofy combination, where a scene cannot be taken seriously with a giant floating head (with off-putting CGI) hanging around in the background. He's not necessarily a bad character, and certainly one who needed to be approached as a light-hearted sideshow, but one that doesn't suit the 'epic' consequence of the end of a civilisation/world/universe.Whilst they're all part of the same universe, and this does take place in a setting only really applicable to Ant-Man and the Wasp, Quantumania does lose a little of it's trilogy's identity. The plot may be heavily tied into the wider MCU saga, but the previous two in the trilogy still had that odd-man-out feel to it in a superhero world. This could have easily been a Guardians of the Galaxy film, complete with comically odd creatures, or any of the Avengers films where an ensemble take on an all-powerful being.That said, Rudd is still great as Lang, and the rest of the cast, far more involved in the plot, match the tone and atmosphere well. The CGI looks good for the most part, even if it is a little sad that the whole film is 90% greenscreen. I can't imagine this will be anyone's favourite film, but it's entertaining and contributes massively to the wider Marvel story.","

"castielminion1","17 February 2023","This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!","

"groundzero-273-397110","25 February 2023","A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!","

But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet.","

"chera_khalid","19 September 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantomania, despite its potential, disappoints with several notable weaknesses that hinder its enjoyment. While its strength lies in the likable performances from Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, the film's plot feels disjointed and lacks the same cleverness and humor that characterized the previous Ant-Man entries. Cinematography is serviceable but doesn't offer any memorable visual spectacles, and the music and visuals, while competent, do little to enhance the overall experience. A 6/10 rating reflects the film's underwhelming execution, as it struggles to live up to the charm and creativity of its predecessors, leaving audiences craving more from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","

"The-Sarkologist","25 April 2023","After a number of rather dull Marvel movies (and series) they have finally released something that actually kept me interested right the way through. Okay, it does seem that it hasn't been received all that well, and it also seems that it hasn't met the box office targets that were estimated, but a part of me feels that maybe, just maybe, people has started to become somewhat bored with the whole idea of the superhero film. Mind you, that probably has quite a lot of do with the success of Endgame, so, yeah, I'm somehow not surprised.However, I actually really liked it. It is basically a science-fiction film, but it takes place in the universe of the Quantum Realm. This is a place that has been teased in previous films, but never really explored. Now that the Thanos arc has been completed, it is certainly time to return to this realm and actually see what is down there, and personally, I thought they did a really good job with that as well.So, the film begins with Scott Lang simply enjoying life, though honestly, it reminded me an awful lot of the opening to Spiderman III. However, things turn a bit sour when his daughter, Cassie, ends up in locked up because she was protesting the eviction of homeless people in the park. After a family discussion, it is revealed that she has been experimenting with mapping the Quantum Realm, though it turns out that Janet hasn't been telling anybody what she discovered when she was trapped in the Quantum Realm, and as such they are all sucked into it, and need to find a way to escape. However, while they are down there we are introduced to the next big bad guy in the series - Kang the Conquerer (though we did meet him once before at the end of season 1 of Loki).I have to say that Jonathon Majors was absolutely outstanding. He really played the character well, and gave us a taste of what this new villain was going to be like (though recent events may change that somewhat). Mind you, unlike the previous cycle, where we are slowly being introduced to the main villain of the piece, in this one, we meet him almost straight away, then the films give us an idea of the nature of the conflict. Actually, another thing that I've noticed is that they have pretty much told us what all of the films are going to be, and the titles of them as well. However, it does sort of make me wonder if we are coming to the end of the Marvel era.As I said, I actually really liked the film, and there are definitely people out there that agreed with me. I personally thought that the whole sci-fi aspect to it, an also exploring the quantum realm is basically what attracted me to the film initially, and I have to say that it certainly did not disappoint, at least where I'm concerned. However, if there is one definite gripe that I did have, and that was with Modok - that just looked so horrible, surely they could have done better than that with all of the experience that they have.","

"SoumikBanerjee1996","19 April 2023","I think they named it wrong; the film title should have been Kang: The Caged Conqueror, The King of Multiverse, or something like that. Why am I saying that? Well, for starters, the story's been written and narrated like a prologue, more like an introduction to the freshest super villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than a movie that is solely based on Ant-Man and his heroic adventures.I would go as far as to say that the entire family of Lang was treated like supporting members of the cast, that too in their own franchise, as the narrative was too invested in giving Kang all the limelight; he has got more cool scenes to act in, he's been lent stronger dialogues, and because of all that in the end he turned out to be a character with maturity and a certain level of depth with a clear goal and purpose unlike Ant-Man or any of his kith and kin.Now, is that good or bad? Actually, it's both.On one hand, Ant-Man has been treated like a trivial addition rather than lead protagonist, but on the other hand, we've got ourselves a great new villain who stands firm and could hold his own. Suffice to say, Jonathan Majors played his part with enough conviction, and I hope and I wish the writers will give his character a fitting resolution by the time he gets his closure and his chapter comes to an end.","

"theredsky","17 June 2023","I'm kind of getting tired of the MCU's constant stream of quantity over quality and this film is just another example of that problem slowly getting worse and worse. It's probably the most visually interesting of the trilogy only because it has more colors than the first two films combined. He actual visuals and cinematography aren't great though. Everything here feels very unmotivated and bland. It doesn't feel like there is a purpose to any of the shots and they are just going through a checklist of basic shots to get for the scene without feeling creative or interesting. The visuals effects range from okay to just bad. Clearly they didn't spend enough time on them and it really shows here because almost every shot has a lot of visual effects work done on them. There is no sense of size or space in these shots especially towards the end where Cassie Lang is over 10 times the size of MODOK but you really couldn't tell if you just watched the clip and not the whole scene. The story is kind of interesting? They definitely had a really solid first draft that just needed a little more work done but instead of doing that, they just took that first draft and ran with it so a lot of ideas and concepts feel underdeveloped and uninteresting. This could have been solved with a rewrite or two but clearly Feige and them don't care about actually doing that work. Most of the performances are good. Paul Rudd is still doing a great job and Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are good as well. Jonathan Majors did a great job as well but with everything that came out after this film came out, the less said the better. Shame that he screwed up his career just as he was taking off. Bill Murray was kind of awful though here but thankfully his scene is short. Kang as the villain was the best part of the film. He was fun and engaging and his plan was interesting but his final scene is awful. For an all powerful being, he goes out really poorly. The humor is all over the place. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's unbearably unfunny. There really isn't a whole lot here to like but it's mostly just boring and not bad like Thor 4 and Black Widow. You can honestly probably skip this one unless you really wanna see Kang.","

"galaxytitan-66249","19 February 2023","This movie was great. The cgi gave me a little bit of a headache but not a migraine or anything. Also this movie is more serious instead of funny. They have jokes in the movie every now and then, but not so much. I don't really like how they handled
M. O. D. O. K. But he was funny and has an exciting return from a previous character. Kang is really scary and disturbing. There is two bonus scenes in total. One of them is a great way to show the future of the multiverse saga and the second one made me jump out of my seat because I was so happy. This film was a great way to open up phase five.8/10.","

"lakings97","6 March 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third movie of the series with all the original cast members returning to this film. I would have to say this was the worst movie of the three that Marvel has created. In this movie the team is accidentally transported to the Quantum Realm where they encounter strange creatures and life that exist as small as the atom. The theme of Freedom comes back around towards a group of alien type creatures that are oppressed by the evil empire led by Kang who is played by Jonathan Majors. The storyline had a Star Wars feel to it, where the empire is trying to rule the galaxy and much is the same in the quantum realm. I think it was silly and couldn't take it seriously. Bill Murray had a cameo and Kathryn Newton played the older Cassie Lang. Overall it was an ok movie that I couldn't care for.","

Hate Paul Rudd so much, he has the most punchable face in movies IMO and couldn't act his way out of a paperbag!!There are some great actors in this but their performances & talents are wasted in this terribly contrived, badly written mess of a film. Don't really know what else to say to fill out six hundred words to be honest. From almost the start this film made me cringe, I couldn't even enjoy the CGI and other effects which I admit were impressive but would have served better in a completely different movie as my attention could not be held, the whole affair was difficult to watch.A huge disappointment & criminal waste of money!!","

"wendieta","20 February 2023","First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential.","

"elhamfirmino","17 February 2023","The third movie was totally different than the previous movies. It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level.","

"nightringer-76840","11 June 2023","The main storyline is actually pretty good, but it failed to coherently stitch the story together the messages that suppose to support the main storyline. Here are the problems that this movie should have cleared out and they ruined the movie:
A young girl built an engine to become a Hubble satellite in the Quantum world without explanation, that's an empowerment message that went too far and farfetched that ot ruined the beginning. If it was Hank Pimp that built it, it would make more sense.Trying to justify the villains as a regular men forced into doing bad things. Disney has been doing this campaign for a decade and this time, it went disgustingly too much and leaves bad taste.Women lead the packs. As mentioned before, it went overboard and too much.The humors are getting dryer and dryer. With Thor Love & Thunder, Wakanda Forever and Wanda - Vision, Marvel's installments are getting too predictable and leaving a lot of bad taste. A lot of unnecessary stories and lots of money grabbing movies.Feige has not changed his strategy of Marvel's movie development all this time, but his directors and writers are getting worse by every new movie. It looks like we are going to lose MCU to overly creative without staying true to the main origin of the story, meaning the Marvel Comics.","

"Vamskye","18 February 2023","Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution.","

The first Ant-Man was a pretty nice sci-fi adventure, but this is a gumpf with no logic, no common sense and a lot of Mary Sue tricks. It's even worse than the fourth Thor, for God's sake! It's like I went to see ""The Lord of the Rings"", but ended up with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" with the entire LoTR cast.You can't do that, Marvel, you just can't. If you want to entertain audiences ages 2 to 8, make something outside the main cinematic universe. Why do well-known heroes have to turn into clowns at a kindergarten matinee?!And stop with the know-it-all teenager nonsense! Stop teaching kids that all you need to get ahead is irresponsibility, and that experience and knowledge are irrelevant.","

"gondiken","18 May 2023","I'll start with a few positives: The idea of entire universes at the subatomic level is very exciting and the cosmetic choices to establish the rules of these universes are well made. The cast is excellent and I've found CGI to be at a good level (considering the amount of CGI that had to be packed into a completely new realm, one or two weird glitches are fine).But the story is written horribly. There is an obscene amount of circumstantial events, multiple characters behave in the way that makes no sense considering their backstory, on several occasions the previously established events from previous movies are ignored, and the expectation of an impending danger in the Phase 5 does not live up to the level we'd expect from Marvel.People interested in storytelling will definitely find themselves thinking of dozens of alternative directions the writers could have gone with this material, because the idea of a quantum realm is incredibly interesting. Just for that, I finished the movie feeling inspired. But none of this feeling can be attributed to the writers of this movie.","

Post Endgame this is the first MCU movie that has a good story, action, drama and a lot of weird aliens - I hope Marvel makes movies about the events in quantum realm. Honestly I had high hopes for Wakanda Forever BUT I couldn't watch 2/3 of it. Half way I was so bored that I had to leave. Quantumania wastes no time and immediately gets into the actual story and action. The jokes are a bit flat, but they don't ruin the experience. I think this is one of the best Ant-man and Wasp movies, and I can't wait to watch it again on Disney plus platform when it is available for streaming.","

It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2.

"tommy-97761","22 April 2023","Do you recall the Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser from 2008? I got a similar feeling watching this. Though the CGI had somewhat improved in the past 15 years, you still don´t give a damn about much that is happening onscreen because it is very obviously fake and shot on a green screen. While the Journey was fun in a guilty pleasure kind of way, this movie just puts you to sleep. I am so glad that I skipped it in the theater. If this is the way marvel movies are heading now, I will skip any future releases as well. Thor Love an Thunder looked horrible, this does as well. The only redeeming quality was Kang, who managed to wake me up in the second half of the movie, though I've heard rumors that due to some allegations Disney and other studios might want to be disassociated with Jonathan Majors for the future. There was little chemistry between the actors, the jokes are flat, the movie looks painfully fake and the third act fight with faceless soldiers against no-name troops is anticlimactic. Why even bother with this movie? Why even bother with Marvel past Endgame? So far, none of the post-endgame movies had really justified their existence. They are hardly worth a cinema ticket anymore.","

"sujanfaster","21 March 2023","It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best.","

"rexmatthewj","3 March 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is the third installment in the Ant-Man franchise and the first film in Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they explore the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension where they encounter strange creatures and a powerful villain named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).The film has a lot of visual spectacle and creativity, as it showcases the wonders and dangers of the Quantum Realm. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining, especially when Ant-Man and Wasp use their shrinking and growing abilities to fight their enemies. The film also introduces some new characters, such as Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter who becomes a political activist, and Jentorra (Katy O'Brian), a Mandalorian-like warrior who helps them in their quest.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from being a great movie. The plot is convoluted and messy, as it tries to juggle too many elements and subplots without giving them enough development or coherence. The film also lacks the humor and charm that made the previous Ant-Man movies so enjoyable, as it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the fun factor. The film also makes some tonal departures from the earlier films, as it deals with darker themes such as trauma, guilt, and genocide.The most disappointing aspect of the film is Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the new main antagonist of the MCU. While Jonathan Majors gives a good performance, his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. He is introduced too abruptly and without much explanation or motivation, making him seem like a generic and bland villain. He also does not pose much of a threat to Ant-Man and Wasp, as they easily defeat him in the end.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some positive aspects, such as the visual effects, the action scenes, and some of the performances, but it also has some negative aspects, such as the plot, the screenplay, and Kang the Conqueror. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a great one either. It is a mediocre movie that could have been much better.","

Kathryn also need to improve more on acting, when doing emotional scene, she not good yet. Storyline is a bit flaws. It's like more on the Scott family, and less Kang story. Also, a lot of CGI using, it's like you watching James Avatar. Also side character, brings this movie a bit comedy, I like the slime (always talk about holes😂😂😂). By the way, it is worth watching. It is a must, if you waiting for the fourth avengers, then you must because it will continue from this movie (spoilers).","

The script is pretty poor and even for someone quite happy to sit through a no brainer movie, this movie is just boring and lacking any original ideas. The Quantum universe that this is set in looks more like something from Star Wars. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man spends too much of the film totally uninterested until his daughter is in danger, so hardly what you expect from an Avenger. I don't know who is writing for Marvel at the moment, but I think Stan would be turning in his grave at how poor Phase 4 has been. It's got that bad that I'm actually dreading Guardians of the Galaxy.","

""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no.","

Maybe it's because Ant-Man's unique power is all about shrinking and not losing strength when doing so. The coolest thing they utilize is probably the quantum suits. But this exceptional and awesome weapon might have run out of freshness, which led to the film focusing more on replicating various human dilemmas in the so-called quantum world. Then it's a repeat of the conflicts caused by the seven emotions and six desires. Haha, I didn't find it very refreshing, but Stoll's MODOK did have its funny moments.","

For the most part, I think that's what was delivered. The first half is lacking in dialog and feels a bit emotionless. Luckily things improve in the second half of the movie across the board. The scale and pace of the second is notably better. A few of the jokes even managed to land(imo)

Cassie is insufferable and I was kind of hoping she'd get eaten by ants, and maybe most of the rest of the cast. The script is just awful. The story is absurd. I was actually kind of shocked by how each scene kept managing to be worse than the one before it. A heavily CGI-reliant movie with horrible CGI, and pretty bad everything else that cost a lot of money to make.

"dave_maguire","19 February 2023","So I'd seen articles saying that hits film had received the lowest score for a marvel film, but was sure this couldn't be correct - after all, we've all seen Love and Thunder haven't we!So I went in with an open mind and upon finishing the film I was left with an unsure feeling about the film. Ant man is great character and I've enjoyed his films and appearances so far in the MCU, and all of these have been quite lighthearted, which makes me feel that the more I think about it, the more I feel that he is the wrong character to introduce the ""new big bad"" into the MCU. Don't get me wrong, given the setting I'm not sure who else could, but the tone of the film is more serious as a result of it, which doesn't seem to fit an Ant man film.It not without its good points of course, Paul Rudd is.... Paul Rudd, and that's never a bad things and he plays the plays the part great yet again, and some of the supporting cast are good also, Michael Douglas was bearable for a change, and I found Evangeline Lily to once again okay the Wasp well. Thee were some some action scenes in it and I found the CGI landscapes seemed to be visually stunning in places, and even though it maybe wasn't all great, to say this film was largely based on green screen, overall it was good.Unfortunately the film was let down by a few things, pacing being one of them as it is all over the place, which causes this to film to drag...a lot, especially in the middle section. There are also a few plot holes and issues that let the film down also. Many surrounding Janet:1. We were told she was alone in the quantum realm, yet she evidently spent years in there fighting a maniacal tyrant..... this never came up in conversation when she was home? Even when they decide to farm quantum particles at the end of the last ant man? Heads up might've been nice for Scott?2. If you're helping Cassie (who is apparently now also a technical genius???) build a machine to study the realm, maybe point out the dangers of it before she does something like this - don't tell her it's an empty realm then have a go at her for building it.3. When you're IN the realm and your family find out something is going on - tell them! None of this ""trust me"" ""there is no time"" crap!Also, I was under the impression, and could be wrong out this, that the suit protected the wearing when shrinking/enlarging, so I'm unsure why Scott and Cassie can take their helmets off, mid battle also, and it not affect them?Unfortunately for me, the main issues were the villains. M. O. D. O. K was never going to be an easy villain to show in live action - unfortunately some characters don't transfer well from page to screen, such as Galactus, so he was never going to look great, but it was the portrayal of him what was more annoying as, despite being feared as a hunter by the locals, he was purely played for laughs through the whole film. He was done better in the Avengers game! But for me the worst one was Kang! I guess the credits scenes show this character was somewhat of a red herring regarding being the ""next Thanos threat"", but this guy couldn't even lace his boots! At no point did we get any indication of his power or threat level, and gets beat rather easily by a regular human man who ""talks to ants"". I honestly expected some of the main cast to be killed in order to put across the threat level but no, everyone is fine - no trouble! Even after Scott and Hope seemingly get trapped in the quantum realm - oh hang on, let me just turn the machine back on... sorted!Also, the whole mulitiverse Kang situation doesn't entirely make much sense to me - so ""He who remains"" was worried of what would come if he got killed, which we all assume was this Kang we saw, who advises that he needs to get out of the realm and warned of what would happen if he didn't, but now he got killed, all the other variants, who banished him for trying to kill them all, decide now that Humans have killed him, they should kill the humans??? Huh?? What?? It really makes no sense?! To me, Kang would be better served just being the antagonist in the Loki series instead.So as always, it's sometimes easier to point out negatives than positives so it probably sounds like I hate this film, it's not perfect, but it's better than some of the more recent efforts.","

"nigeldimitrius","17 February 2023","Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat.","

"Eblogary","27 February 2023","I have watched all of the phase 4, and it is much better than anything released in the previous phase. The acting of Jonathan Majors was fabulous. Every scene of Kang felt menacing. The movie established Kang as the big villain of MCU pretty well.However, the potential of Wasp and MODOK was wasted as they received very little run time. MODOK was just a comedy relief character. VFX were great. The MODOK with big head looked goofy but that's how it should look like. The MODOK did not look unrealistic unlike the floating head in Thor 4.There were some plot-holes, and logical mistakes but overall it was fun, as comic book movies should be. It had some good jokes, but they did not feel unnecessary like the jokes in Thor 4. In comparison with Thor 4, and Doctor Strange 2, it was a much better movie.","

"dhozu","17 February 2023","Jonathan Majors performance as 'Kang The Conqueror' is praise worthy, he delivers it with great intensity. Kang chaos is kicked off for the 'Multiverse Saga', with this entry movie of MCU Phase 5. Entertainment is filled with humorous comedy and action that MCU delivers as always. Adventure of quantum realm with good screen time is key to this movie, and you will love to see good family drama enhanced. Lower your expectation and enjoy this movie in 3D, I don't understand why is this movie getting such rotten reviews. Wait until last before getting of your seats, those two P. C. S . Is awesome, it won't let you disappoint.","

"sjo-15","20 February 2023","It started off well. The bits set in the real world have humour and character.Then they go to the quantum realm and it falls apart. The vast majority of the film is CGI. Endless CGI. Too much CGI. Seen it all before.We are expected to care about a war happening in the quantum realm between two factions its hard to care about. We are told which side we should root for.Then at the end we are told we might have rooted for the wrong side - it might not be as simple as we thought.Then in true Marvel style something weird happens that has you questioning everything, including whether its worth it at all as they can now throw away all rules required for something to be realistic and have something we can root for, and do what they like.Paul Rudd can't save it, watchable as he is.Michelle Pfeiffer is miscast.Michael Douglas is under used, restricted largely to comic relief.The whole film is started by the actions of three characters who should know better, and if they behaved as they would in reality would never have carried out the actions that cause them all to be sucked into the quantum realm. Of course they shouldn't have been messing with what they were messing with... (Makes it even less believable).Might have worked better at 90 minutes - the length such movies used to - and should - be.","

"SafReviews","5 May 2023","I liked the first 2 Ant-Man movies and I didn't have high hopes for this movie considering the mixed review it has got, but I actually liked it. I thought the plot was intriguing right from the beginning and I was invested till the end. People are saying the plot is just like any other Marvel movie plot and they might be right, but I wasn't bored with the story or find it similar to any other Marvel movie that I've seen before. The action scenes were good just as you would expect from a Marvel movie. I thought the bad guy Kang was good and felt like unique bad guy, but he might not be in any more movies as expected because the actor is probably going to cancelled for abuse.","

"Vivekmaru45","30 April 2023","Not as good as the first installment though. I thought the first half was boring. The second half picked up the pace though and made it half-enjoyable.I'm not a Paul Rudd fan and not a Ben Affleck one too. I think both these dudes look the same. It was good to see Michelle Pfeiffer again(Batman Returns, Into The Night). My favorite actor Bill Murray(Ghostbusters, Groundhog day) has aged badly though. Michael Douglas(Black Rain, Jewel Of The Nile, The Star Chamber, The War Of The Roses, The Ghost And The Darkness, Falling Down) still looks good. It was great to see all these legends together one last time.Okay about the movie. The special-effects are saturated with CGI same like the Shazam sequel. The story deals with Janet van Dyne(Pym's wife) being trapped in the Quantum realm. The rest of the plot deals with a device that can make entry into the Quantum realm and thereby rescue Janet.Verdict: just about enjoyable for a one-time viewing. And movies like these are meant to be watched in a cinema to experience the best sound and visuals.","

Scott and family find themselves pulled into the quantum realm, only to discover it's also another universe, and Janets past quickly comes back to haunt her.Jonathan Majors really blew me away has the villian Kang, givin a type Darth Vader like performance, even with his calmness you clearly see the insanity in him. Paul Rudd once again brings likable comic charm, Michael Douglas was good, so was Evanegline Lilly and Michelle Pfieffer. Sometimes Kathryn Newton was annoying , but other times she was good. The effects are awesome, I love the star wars like adventure.","

"fraser-simons","19 February 2023","This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme.","

"jace_the_film_guy","20 February 2023","The opening of this film is fantastic. I found myself laughing seconds after the MARVEL title rolled. Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang never feels like an act, as he naturally fits the role. His character is charming as ever in his 5th movie as Ant-Man.Marvel is known for extensive world-building and interconnected stories. Since 2021's ""Loki"", it has been known that Kang the Conqueror is the next Thanos-level villain in the MCU. This film gives us a deeper look at Kang, and the casting for his character (Jonathan Majors) is excellent.By leaving the regular world and diving into the world beneath (the Quantum Realm), the film relies heavily on green screens and computer-generated imagery (CGI). These graphics and effects are some of the poorest of the franchise, with a character called MODOK being the worst. There were times that the film was reminiscent of 2005's ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"".Other than the CGI, the biggest weakness in this film is the screenplay. From rushed plot points to painful dialogue, it is evident that the screenwriter had never written something of this magnitude. In the emotional and climactic moments, the script is so bad that it distracts from the story, with the audience in my theater audibly laughing.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a small piece in the larger Marvel storyline. This is felt throughout the film, as the convoluted Quantum Realm and endless timelines are explored. The first two Ant-Man movies succeeded in simplicity, but this sequel was anything but simple. In short, the character of Scott Lang is better as the friendly, neighborhood Ant-Man.Best Character: Kang
Best Scene: Scott's Book Reading
Best Quote: ""I don't have to win. We both just have to lose!"" - Scott
Best Piece of Score: ""Theme from 'Quantumania'"" - Gives serious Avengers Campus vibes.","

"lhbaker-28783","1 July 2023","Honestly, he's one of the best villains in the MCU and in this movie he absolutely carries. This movie probably would've been my least favorite MCU movie without him. In fact, I was kind of rooting for him, something I've never done in any movie. Everything else but the comedy (which is quite underrated on IMDb) was absolutely horrible. Especially M. O. N. O. K. Or Derek. Any part that he's in pains me. I wish he wasn't a part of this movie. Most of the Quantumania people are forgettable too, but there are some good ones. The CGI is iffy in some spots but for the rest of the movie it's alright. Overall, Quantumania was half really good and half cheesy that I only recommend if you don't absolutely hate Phase 4 MCU.","

"gettodamoofies","30 May 2023","FILM: 5.5/10.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unfortunately falls victim to a tired formula, representing a weak start to Phase Five. While the first Ant-Man film introduced a refreshing comedic twist to the superhero genre, and the second had its moments despite a dip in quality, this third entry feels like a regurgitation of familiar ideas without any significant innovation.One of the main drawbacks of Quantumania is its heavy reliance on non-stop CGI spectacle at the expense of a quality script. The film bombards viewers with over-the-top action sequences that quickly become exhausting, leaving little room for character development or meaningful storytelling.However, there are a few bright spots in the film. Jonathan Majors delivers a standout performance as Kang, displaying his range and talent. However, recent personal matters surrounding the actor may potentially jeopardize the character's inclusion in upcoming MCU entries, which is a concern for fans of the franchise.On a positive note, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly enjoy increased screen presence, and their performances are commendable. Their chemistry helps to inject some much-needed life into the film, even if the overall product falls short.Unfortunately, the portrayal of M. O. D. O. K., a formidable Marvel villain, fails to translate effectively from the page to the screen. The character lacks the depth and menace that fans have come to expect, resulting in a missed opportunity to create a compelling antagonist.Curiously, the design and plot similarities to the Star Wars prequels are hard to ignore, as is the inclusion of several Star Wars cast members. While some may appreciate the homage and cross-pollination, it feels like a distraction and adds little value to the overall narrative.Despite the charm and charisma brought by Paul Rudd and the standout performance by Jonathan Majors, these factors alone are not enough to offset the criticisms of the film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania falls short of its predecessors and fails to deliver a fresh and engaging addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.Native 4K presentationDetail level: ExcellentColour reproduction: ExcellentLevel accuracy: GoodEncode: ExcellentMaster condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 8/10.Dolby Atmos audioDialogue reproduction: ExcellentSoundtrack & effects clarity: ExcellentDynamics: GoodSurround sound presentation: ExcellentLFE content: ModerateMOOFIEMETER: 6/10.","

"mjpiro","18 May 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the story of a family that gets transported to the Quantum Realm and spends a majority of the movie trying to defeat Kang the Conqueror, played nicely by Jonathan Majors (Creed III), who controls the alternate reality and escape from it!! Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania stars funnyman Paul Rudd (Ghostbuster: Afterlife) as Scott Lang with his superhero alias as Ant-Man, an Avenger who is coming fresh off a victory with some of the Avengers, saving the entire world and is feeling pretty good about it in the beginning part of this film!! Also starring in this movie is Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost) who plays Hope Van Dyne with her superhero alias as The Wasp having the ability to fight and fly with great power and speed when she has her wasp suit on. Michael Douglas (Wall Street) as Dr. Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns) as Janet Van Dyne, and Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang all round out the top members of this cast as members of an extended family. It is at Dr. Pym's house where the group accidentally gets beamed to the Quantum Realm and spend a majority of the movie fighting aliens and Kang in order to get back to San Francisco and Earth. Quantumania - as I will be calling it for the remainder of this review - is a good movie - it's good but it is not great!! I like how the movie takes us from beautiful San Francisco all this way to this glowing dystopian Quantum Realm but once we are in the Quantum Realm there is not much imagination to the sets besides what we are given. The acting is good, Rudd combines comedy with action like nobodies business and is one of the few people that could play this role successfully!! The story is the same for Lilly, she does a terrific job as the Wasp, especially with the fight scenes!! Peyton Reed did a nice job directing this film and bringing all of the different talent together to tell a cohesive story. The team of Jeff Loveness, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, and Ernest Hart all did a nice job contributing to the story of Quantumania in some way or the other. Christophe Becke handled the music for Quantumania very well!! Sammy Sheldon did a nice job costuming all of the different characters - superhero or otherwise!! Quantumania received a PG-13 rating so it requires parental supervision for those under 13 otherwise it is the perfect movie for those seeking a fun escape for a couple hours!! 6 out of 10 stars!!","

"xiaoli7377","17 February 2023","""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself.","

Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+.","

It's slow, boring and extremely messy. Messed up storyline and I almost fell asleep 50mins in.It feels way too long despite only being 2 hours long. The beginning is messy and tries to be fun and giggly, but it's not really working that well. Some sequences are alright and a bit funny, but if funny is Guardians of The Galaxy - then this is not funny at all.. it's the worst Marvel movie...actually worse than Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness.

"classicsoncall","21 May 2023","Well, it finally happened. Marvel has gone full-out Star Wars. Or Star Trek if that's your disposition, but with Disney owning the Star Wars franchise, that comparison is more apt. And not because the action takes place in Outer Space; it's more like Inner Space when you consider the Quantum Realm where the story takes place. The characters go sub-atomic almost right from the start and stay that way until the story concludes. On the basis of spectacular CGI and wonderful cinematography, the film would merit a '10' rating, but then you get to the story itself and that's where you have to average things down a bit. I don't think the story evolved from the two prior Ant-Man films. It's been too long since I've seen them and can't really remember them that well, but my reviews of both don't suggest a direct link to what happens in this one. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this flick, but not surprised that he did his standard Bill Murray type of schtick. He should try mixing things up every now and then. As for M. O. D. O. K., I thought that was Jason Alexander's head in the box. I felt he would have been a good choice for the role, but the guy was really Corey Stoll, who wasn't even credited! Why would that be? Anyway, I enjoyed this about as much as any other Marvel movie, but just like a lot of them, including the first two Ant-Man flicks I mentioned, it won't stay in memory very long after seeing it. Someday when I have the time maybe I'll watch these films back to back, but for right now, I'm pretty much satisfied with one and done.","

There really wasn't much fun in this movie as the previous ones. I love Antman and was so excited when they first introduced him, and they totally dumped on it.Modok...REALLY!?! How did they put that out like that? Terminator 2 was released before CGI took over the movie industry and had WAY better looking CGI than this.Kang. He was cool, but there has been so much buzz around his the actor stole the show with his portrayal, but I think anyone in that role would've made the movie exactly the same.Michael Peña...is NOT in the movie which has been such a great addition to each of the other Antman movies and an absolute fan favorite...but it seems the fans aren't who they're trying to please, here.Cassie...whatever. Really nothing particularly special about her character or the actress, herself.Seriously...SERIOUSLY just so disappointed in what Marvel has been doing lately. Just ruining everything.","

"Filipe_R_Santos89","23 February 2023","I don't understand all the hate that has been distilled for the latest Marvel movies... I only understand from ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", which really was a waste of funds for such a bad movie.But this movie is not bad. It's not one of the best, but it's not bad at all.Don't forget that this movie was shot at the time of the pandemic and I believe it took some extra work and adjustments.In my opinion I was only concerned about two things, the fact that Scott starts to become associated with a comical, sometimes awkward character and another is that on one hand we see a very comic book-like Cassie, but on the other hand it seems that there is a blockage on the part of Kevin Feige's team to be faithful to the elements of the ""original story"", which bothers me a bit being a fan of the comics - in short, that's my opinion.I really enjoyed Kang, all the content, and I confess I was apprehensive about the MODOK presentation, but I was fascinated by the work that was done.To like a Marvel movie you have to understand this universe, and I still think that many of the people who rate it negatively don't know what they are talking about at all.Conclusion, good movie...not perfect, and by far to be one of the best.I really hope they grab these new characters that are appearing (America Chavez, Ms Marvel, Cassie Lang, Kate Bishop...) and give the ""Young Avengers"" a future because I think it could work well.","

"youngbmega","6 May 2023","Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has begun, and how did it start? Actually not as expected. Not convincing! Not impressive! With the advent of such an antagonist, the story should have developed as intensely, disturbingly and dangerously as possible. But we got what we got, and obviously this is not what many expected. The history of the family is good (it was clear from the trailers too), but the characters could have been better developed, the relationship between Scott and Casey, as well as Janet and Hope. But somehow you do not fully believe them. Plus, in the previous pictures it was said that the Quantum Realm is so dangerous that it is better not to go there. And what happened?! The danger is Kang himself, and the world is beautiful, but not really unsettling. As a result, it is mandatory to watch, as this is the seed for the future, especially the scenes after the credits. But if you look at the general line of the movie universe, 6/10.","

It wasn't special and there are certainly better Marvel movies. But it's a good introduction to what is coming up next. This movie did what it needed to do, get us excited for Phase 5. Remember, people who didn't like this film are still gonna come back and watch every upcoming Marvel film from Phase 5 and beyond. While it does have a predictable and tame story, 90% of movies are predictable anyway. We don't watch movies for the ending, we watch them for what leads up to it. It's an enjoyable superhero film that people will come back to appreciate if Phase 5 gets it right.","

"mattstone137","17 February 2023","Another season, another entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth's trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.Quantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It's utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords' pockets with cash.The film follows Scott Lang and company as they're sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel's most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M. O. D. O. K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.The MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it's difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven't been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.The tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.Specifically, Quantumania's story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There's hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes' stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.None of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly...doesn't really have much to do, honestly.Jonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He's a great actor, but not an intimidator - he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn't here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.What else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions.The true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.Take the thought further - hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or (your favorite filmmaker). Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.All a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that.Writing this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme. Either way, blessed release.","

"beichorndude","18 February 2023","Beign the third installment to the Ant-Man (and the Wasp) franchise I went in having an idea what to expect. Something a little light, tone-wise, but with Kang being introduced I also knew the levity would be moved aside for the weight of the story. All previous characters were pretty close to the previous story's portrayal. Michelle Pfeiffer's role was expanded, which she did great with. Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang filled the role nicely as well, but not quite the same charm as Rudd.I knew that it would be CGI heavy but I felt that made it slightly harder to digest what was going on. Most locations and characters were full of CGI - not that that's a bad thing, but it really made it hard to tell what was happening at time.The story was pretty good. It took a while for it to get to the crux of the problems, but it was a fun ride to get there. . I would have liked a little more backstory on the main villain, but I'm sure we will get more of that as Phase 5 continues.Overall, if you enjoyed the other Ant-Man movies and know that the tone will start getting a little darker, you will enjoy this movie. Just don't expect it to be Civil War or Infinity War.","

"mickeythechamp","19 May 2023","I am literally baffled. I have always been a marvel sceptic, that I have never hidden. I have always thought some MCU movies could at time be nothing more than mindless action and that´s fine, that just doesn't get high ratings from me. I have my bottom MCU films like everyone else, but this, this is the new low. This is one of the most soulless movies I have ever watched and while it didn't infuriate me as other of my lowest ranked movies did, this one just left me without a single feeling in my body. This phase of the MCU has been disappointing on so many levels and delivered the one bad to mediocre movie after another, but I have now seen the low point where the light doesn't shine, where pure numbness exist and Marvel finally became nothing more than colors and sounds from your TV and nothing more.Scott Lang, now not really doing anything with his life is confronted by his daughter who has made a device that can enter the quantum realm again. Janet tries to stop them from activating the device, but the entire Van Dyne family is dragged into the Quantum realm. They most now find a way while avoiding the evil overlord of the quantum realm, Kang.What really sets me off about this movie is the lack of care, lack of good storytelling but mostly lack of a soul. This is a movie that feel fully AI generated where anyone could have written it and it uses so many basic tropes, clichés and basic story devices it´s painfully obvious you are just watching a movie. I was never sucked in, never cared for anything or anyone and I was just watching colorful screens and hearing noises instead of watching a movie. There was nothing here for me to get me engaged and when I pretend care more for a character with a lamp for a head than any of our mains and villains, that's a bad thing. At least other Marvel movies were just poorly written or infuriatingly written where you get some emotions, here, nothing.The characters aren't really characters here. They are vessels for the storytelling and nothing more. They don't do anything, barely have arcs, and barely represent humans. They act and feel like written robots just moving from A to B and dose whatever the movie wants them to do. Once again, the soullessness shows itself. Antman feels barely like himself. His family are just there, and the title character Wasp are barely in the movie. The balancing of the 5 different main characters isn't there and we never get to connect with any of them. The new characters are also just here and when the villain MODOK has more of a character arc than any of our main characters that's a problem.You have heard about it but it really is that bad. The effects are so terrible in this movie. We are given an entirely new world to explore, but none of it has any impact because it´s just like brown and because they do the green screen trick, out of focus. I want to see what´s going on in the background, I want to see the quantum realm. But I´m given nothing but blur. The problem with that is I can only see this movie as characters standing up against a wall trying to act. The visual medium that movies are, are not utilized at all here, it´s just person one, talking to themselves against a brown wall of blur. It´s embarrassing to watch. MODOK looks like absolute garbage with nothing more than a stretchtool used and in general everything just looks so underwhelming.The quantum realm doesn't really fell like it makes any scenes at all. It actually feels like an asset flip with random characters and creatures just being here because why not. I don't understand the world and never felt in awe over how it worked because it´s just a normal town with random characters thrown into it.This movie is split into two separate storylines that are kind of just mushed together in the end because that's what´s supposed to happen. The lack of character and the terrible dialogue leaves none of the two stories interesting and compelling.I have to talk about this terrible script. It is clearly someone's first and you might think that you should cut it some slag then. Well to me, that's no excuse when your 30 something movies in to a franchise, this is where you get the big guns. The plot is clearly an executives clip notes as to what is spoused to happen in the movie and the rest is plastered together with mushy tropes, clichés and writing 101. The dialogue is not how real people talk, it´s whatever is need to be said to move the movie forward and give foreshadowing. The characters have to act like absolute morons in order to make the movie work. Why has Janet not told anyone about Kang before? Why isn't she informing her family at all? It´s infuriating that the characters don't act like humans and are forced to act badly in order to make the movie have surprises. None of the actors can really pull of the stilted robotic dialogue and the acting in general is not good here. I think Jonathan Majors dose the best job here, until the end credit scene rolled around.The humor doesn't really land for the most part for me. Every kind of humor is thrown at the wall so eventually something will land. Random equals funny, dragged out things, word play so on so forth.But this was an introduction to a big bad and to be honest, I´m not afraid. Ant man can win against him, his not a thread. His motivation is also so vague it hurts and I hope we get more of a motivation from him later. This was just a movie to tell you ""hey, this guy is a thing"" and that's all it does. The movie really has nothing going for it and the character arcs are not important and barely done at all. Everything is package in such a cookie cutter way that it hurts to watch.I know I have rambled a lot and it sounds like I have a lot of emotions, but the funny part is, I don't. I feel nothing for this movie and it´s one of the movies where I just felt like I just wasted X amount of time of my life. I wasn't moved or was asked to feel any emotions what so ever and once again it was nothing more than colors and noises from my TV.","

"ycxsdhswjs","6 March 2023","True to the trailer, Quantumania picks up nicely where Avengers: End Game left us. Straightforward storyline makes for a good stand alone film but also a great addition to the long running story arc through the introduction of Marvel cinematic universe's new antagonist -Kang. I enjoyed the humour; it has Ricky and Mortey feel to it and I thought it added a nice touch to it. The weird and wacky characters, superb special effects and Whitt dialogue made the film funny and engaging. I can't say it was the best marvel movie that I've ever seen; but, it was still a good movie and far better than most sci-fi content.","

"droideka75","19 March 2023","So where to begin... Premise is good, they go to quantum realm, they have an adventure they get back. Quantum realm should have been only half the movie, other half should have been how to get there. No, it's a CGI world with a villain that did nothing but be a joke. That's ridiculous MODOK. He looks ridiculous but he could be at least menacing. And turning ridiculous into something great has always been Marvel strength. Just look at Arnim Zola. He's basically a giant robot with a teletubby tv face in the comics. Pretty menacing in winter soldier. But no they couldn't/wouldn't figure out a way to adapt him, so he's just kind of there. Mostly comic accurate (not even that he's supposed to be body horror deformed) physically but the rest? He's just kinda there for laughs. Laughs that don't come.Fine, but the heros go on a journey right? No! They merely travel. They see wonderous things and what do they end up? Same as they were before. There's no character progression for any of the main cast except maybe Janet! Hope has literally nothing to do the entire movie. Scott and Cassie have a tiny argument about Scott being a hero and having to help. All good by the end, no lessons learned, nothing. Status quo is reset. And the inhabitants are portrayed as inept if they need 4 shrinking heroes that mainly give out a small uninspired speech to motivate them. That's literally it. The heroes do nothing of substance that the inhabitants couldn't do on their own. And such a waste of talent... Even bill Murray feels flat, Wich I thought impossible, but here we are.CGI was shady, some good parts, but mostly boring green screen stuff, or volume. There's even a shot where Cassie and Scott embrace while giant that has nothing to compare them to like a building or something recognizable, so they look like regular size just slightly slower. Got my biggest laugh, but I'm sure it wasn't supposed to be funny, didn't work either way.Some of the character designs are good, the hole guy, the lamp guy, but again they have barely anything to do.The only true quality in the movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang. It literally saved the movie. I can't stress this enough he's phenomenal! And I hope Marvel puts him in much better projects cause he nailed it! Can't wait to see more of him.I'm inclined to think a lot of the blame falls on the writer, that didn't know/care about these characters. It's just poorly poorly written. And KF that approved this.Trend continues for Marvel unfortunately. They try so hard to be funny, they fail. Laughs came easy when they weren't actively ridiculing themselves. They need to take themselves serious and sprinkle some jokes not make a mockery of the source material and frankly of the fans. If the writers don't have respect for the comics, this is what happens. Thor 4 and Quantumania. I thought mom and eternals had issues but at least they took themselves serious. This? This an insult.I give it a 6 mainly for Kang or this would be a miserable 5.","

"masonsaul","18 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania frustratingly serves the greater the MCU a lot more than it should, abandoning a lot of the stakes and the franchise's unique aspects for a safe and predictable 2 hour phase 5 trailer that confirms the Ant Man trilogy to be the weakest so far.However, it's still a fun and enjoyably wacky sci-fi adventure that doesn't overstay it's welcome, offers the occasional reminder that the MCU formula can work and features a terrific villain in the form of Jonathan Majors' Kang.Paul Rudd is great, it's an inherently safe performance that's likeable without displaying that much range and he nails that yet again. Despite sharing the title Evangeline Lily gets very little to do but Michael Douglas is the scene stealer with the best humour and a lot less expositional dialogue this time around.Kang is a generically evil character here but in the hands of Jonathan Majors he is an absolute force of nature, elevating this one note character into a softly spoken menace who brings the film to life whenever he's on screen.Peyton Reed's direction is fine, it looks competent overall with a few visually impressed moments but struggles to establish real scale within the quantum realm. The CG is the same as it always with these, hit and miss throughout and alternating from impressive to awful within the same scene.The music by Christophe Beck is a bit of a letdown, none of that playfulness or sense of fun that makes the previous Ant-Man scores so memorable is here and it only really comes to life during the credits.","

"jolerozeerio","18 February 2023","This is my favorite of the Ant Man trilogy. In this movie, the Ant Family is taken hostage and spread across the Quantum Realm, discovering a truly dangerous madman at the center of this alternate universe plotting his escape. As always, the performances were incredibly fun to watch and it was nice being able to spend time with the Langs and the Pym's as they trek across this vast and surreal landscape.Certain characters get more play than others, which is regrettable. Evangeline Lilly feels sidelined in this film which doesn't feel right given her characters importance in these movies thus far. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer are charming as ever, Paul Rudd feels dynamic and confident in his third solo hero outing, but the real gem of this story is Jonathan Majors and Kang the Conqueror.Unlike He Who Remains, Kang is without whimsy. He isn't playful or charming, he is ruthless and deeply driven to escape the Quantum Realm to continue his conquest across time and space. He is played with genuine menace and arrogance, truly displaying the danger he represents to the Avengers and the multiverse as a whole.Overall, this is a strong, albeit inconsistent start to the MCU's Phase Five with the promise of more adventure to come.","

The film ending is somewhat lackluster, also its introduction to ideas and characters that never develop rightfully drag the pace and momentum. Also the performance by actress Kathryn newton is unfortunately one of the dragging moments on screen: not convincing and plenty of occasions forceful. Paul Judd as the so called ""small guy with room to grow"" is good, but not amazing that will blow the audience away in the titular role. The film has several ideas that surely the marvel cinematic universe will come back to pick up and use, lets hope that they will un due time will have their time to have enough room up grow.","

"amiticiae","17 February 2023","I have had the privilege and fortune to be able to watch it on opening day in 3D. I personally mostly enjoyed it, but I found some flaws with it.Let's get to the positives first. Majors was genuinely threatening and scary as Kang, his gravitas being genuinely scary and chilling for the entire multiverse. He has managed to be a legitimate contender to Thanos' throne as MCU's biggest villain yet. Another positive I can note is the humor. Now, I did not laugh out loud at every single joke that the film had to offer, but its heart was mostly genuine, and some of it did land. (MODOK's appearance was ironically pretty funny to me, the CGI monstrosity was... something.)Now let me get to the negatives. If it weren't for the fact I watched it in 3D, I think it would be obvious most of the time that they are on a green screen in a CGI world. The creatures in the Quantum Realm were mostly uninspired. It was clear they had taken references from other sources and... eh. It kinda looked busy.The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he lives his life in San Francisco. It all starts off normally until his daughter, Cassie, gets freed from prison after she was in some sort of protest or whatever? Then they go to Hank's lab or something and they discover that they can communicate with the Quantum Realm. That machine goes wrong and they get transported into the Quantum Realm. They find their way in, learn a bunch of customs and, after drinking some slime, can communicate with whatever creatures there are in this realm.Then at some point, Ant-Man, Hope, Hank, Cassie and all the others get separated, things go on, Bill Murray appears and is freaking cool, at some point there comes Kang, some more things happen, then it really begins to end when Ant-Man, Hope and Cassie stand alongside Kang, and Kang says ""I conquer worlds, you talk with ants"" and Hank just comes with a CGI army of ants to save the day, and then they're in some tower and the little guy has to sacrifice, then it's kinda bittersweet.Fine plot, it works, it was entertaining, but honestly I liked what 3D could bring to me and my favorite part was when the screen went dark and he got into the nucleum and there was the Storm of Possibilities, pretty cool CGI. Entertaining, good as an introduction to Kang, but not much else. Could have been a lot better.","

Yet again though, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is yet another PG13, CGI mud fest.So when we pick up, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is walking down the streets of San Francisco underneath the theme song from Welcome Back, Kotter....After a quick voiceover the characters are inexplicably flung into the throes of a Star Wars, CGI, acid trip. Even though some of the visuals are interesting, this movie has no discernible plot. It is literally just one, big CGI mud fest after another. If you told me that this movie was written by a third grade boy on a sugar, I wouldn't fall out of my chair in the shock.The true crime here is that for months on end, Marvel have touted Quantumania as ""An Avengers Level Event"", which was clearly a blatant lie. At the end of the film, nothing has taken place.It's a crying shame.","

Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have great chemistry, and I did enjoy how malevolent Jonathan Mayors plays Kang, but he also gives him a hint of Royalty with his demeanor. The story is also great, outside of Hawkeye this is one of the most lighthearted stories post Avengers: Endgame, which is okay. But the real stand-out of the movie is Cassie Lang.I think Kathryn Newton is a great addition to the MCU, her portrayal of Cassie is flawless, she portrays her both very badass and emotional.This is a great movie to kick start Phase V, I can't wait to see what comes next.","

"ta-98251","19 February 2023","The Ant-Man series was appealing because it was a small scale Superhero movie which allowed Marvel focus on a fun, personable and acceptably comedic story.Quantumania steps away from this as it serves as the major introduction of Kang the Conqueror on the big screen. This has a positive and negative impact on the film.Kang is easily the best part of the film. He is played excellently by Jonathan Majors and for the most part, has a great on screen presence. He's by far the most menacing villain we've seen in the Ant-Man series and pretty much carries the film alongside Ant-Man.We also get to explore the Quantum realm which looks unique when compared to most other marvel properties. There was a lot about it that felt like Star Wars. For the most part the CGI in the Quantum realm looked really good but one of the sub villains is by far the worst CGI character Marvel has ever created. It was legitimately off putting.There was also a lot of exposition to try and fill us in on what happened off screen to tie the Ant-Fam and Kang worlds together. It felt like I was listening to an audio book and the explanations weren't always well thought out. Not to mention, we get another Marvel child genius pop out of nowhere.Quantumania was an average entry into the MCU. It's not as bad as some critics have suggested but not enough to get you really excited for Phase 5. Whilst the scale of the movie increased it did manage to keep some of the charm and wit that has made the series enjoyable although it wasn't as well placed in this movie.","

The action set pieces are not good enough. Kathryn Newton gives a poor acting performance as Cassie. MODOK might be the most laughably bad villain ever seen on screen. Even the typical big CGI fight at the end was disappointing.The only positive about this film is Jonathan Majors as Kang. He gives a really good performance. The movie picked up after his arrival at around the hour mark, until it fell again during the end fight. Paul Rudd is fine, but not as charming as we expect him to be. Had some good visual ideas, but they were poorly executed due to the abysmal VFX.It's a hodgepodge of Star Wars and Rick and Morty in an MCU film where nothing actually works.

"ashfordofficial","19 April 2023","The film felt underwhelming on a second watch but I still enjoyed the overall experience. As a 100% VFX heavy movie, there's some pretty impressive visual effects and also some questionable effects as well. Unfortunately the script was mediocre with poorly written dialogues that devoid of emotion. The film was unnecessarily too long and slow pacing. Probably another victim of MCU's mandatory 2 hour runtime stipulation. I'm not against the idea, but without a solid script and a creative direction there's nothing else to do that can make a movie entertaining that long. I understand the negative reaction to this movie, even though I liked it. All I can say is that this one is miles better than the trainwreck called, Thor: Love and Thunder.I like Kathryn Newton but I agree her performance was sort of lackadaisical in this movie. In my opinion she delivered a satisfying performance. But I can't say the same about Paul Rudd, his performance was kinda sloppy most of the time. I think the age is catching up to him. Jonathan Majors gave a satisfying performance than his other cast mates. Also it turns out this is probably his first and final portrayal of Kang in an MCU film.","

Disappointment is what follows. Jonathan Majors, Kang 'The Conqueror' was menacing and terrifying and a large part of Marvel Audience cheered him up to break free and rule in the Avengers ""Kang Dynasty"" Marvel (as always) shot down those hopes and killed him off.The whole movie was great in my opinion, but the last 20 min, ruined it. What is the point in building up Kang The Conqueror throughout all promo for the movie and including in the movie itself to just kill him off. He can kill avengers and whole timelines - but he can't defend himself against some ants. And i wont get started on M. O. D. O. K who was a ""killing machine"" and didn't proceed to kill anyone of significance at all.Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania had incredible potential to kick off Phase 5 with a bang, but in the end, everything that happened didn't have any significance for the future other then some funny looking kangs seen in the End-Credits scene that the audience has no connection with.The future of Marvel looks dark and i am not excited anymore.","

It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film.

"politicidal","13 August 2023","'Quantumania' is on the lower end of the MCU but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's more of a standalone adventure that happens to feature not one but two generations of Ant-Man and the Wasp.The CGI effects for the Quantum Realm and the various action scenes look pretty; and lead to some rather original designs for the settings and creatures. I know that Marvel Studios has gotten flack for shortchanging their effects artists, but their work paid off here. There's some stellar imagery to behold in this movie.Paul Rudd is great in this along with Jonathan Majors as the new villain Kang the Conqueror. For all this movie's faults, Kang is not one of them. He's menacing in a subtle way but can be bombastic when the moment calls for it. But I will say it's strange that Kang is not in the movie as much as you would expect. With Rudd as Scott Lang, he's likable as usual and his motivations are immediately sympathetic. He's a good everyman for a weird story like this taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Returning cast members Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly are not bad in this but it seems like they have less to do. Kathryn Newton takes over as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie and though not badly acted, her character is kind of annoying. It's one of those daughter characters who are written as a know-it-all in the mistaken belief that it makes them look smart.For all the controversy surrounding Bill Murray, which I think is overblown, he is not in the movie that much. It's a glorified cameo where he plays a very obscure Marvel character. Corey Stoll comes back as Darren Cross who in this universe becomes the hideous villain MODOK. This is a character who should be threatening but he's really more annoying than actually sinister.The movie just kind of feels overblown with the stunning visuals and scope. Yet also underwritten. A lot of key information is told via flashback or exposition dumps. As if it was a re-shoot or a scene was just cut. I will say it didn't feel long since it's about two hours and that feels like enough. It really doesn't waste time .Without going into spoilers too much, you do think the movie is setting up high stakes and for some characters to make the ultimate sacrifice. And that does happen but not the way you think it might.","

The humor is lacking, the story is bland, and the special effects just seemed rushed and incomplete. There is a specific character in this film that straight up looked like they took inspiration from George Lopez's character in Spy Kids. If that was the vision they were going for, great job Peyton Reed. Also was it really necessary to have a cameo from an older comedic actor (I won't spoil who) that has been reportedly abusive on set. I think whoever made that decision did not mind cuz as long as we get more eyes on the screen, it doesn't matter. This is a ridiculous film, with Paul Rudd trying his best to keep it together. Even his charm couldn't save this film. Pass on this for sure.","

"matheusgarces","18 February 2023","Some people will say that Kang is too weak, and that's true (that's a bad part), however, we must remember that only 2 years from now that Kang dynasty will be released, for sure the character Kang will become much stronger. Having said that the film is adventure but not silly, it has jokes as expected from Ant Man, this is not a problem, also Spider man makes jokes and it is not a problem. Kang's story with Jannet is pretty good (one of the best parts of the movie). Jonathan majors acts perfectly. *The film has two post credits scenes in the first one several Kang's appear including Ramatut. In the second scene we have a scene from season 2 of Loki with a version of Kang in the past.","

The genius ""peanut"" builds a quantum realm device and finds the exact world that her grandmother lived in. Plus peanut helps the evil tyrant escape to the real world? (who knows? Who cares?). It's the third Marvel movie I've watched where I almost got up and left, and was thinking of the negative review I was going to write.. WHILE I was watching the movie. I kept looking at my watch wishing the ending would come soon. I reluctantly sat through the ending credits. I wish I wouldn't have.","

"darkreignn","26 February 2023","Surprise! I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch.","

"Classic_Boxing_Matches","9 June 2023","The Lang/Pim family get sucked into the Quantum realm where they encounter a new, fearsome enemy - Kang the Conqueror.I have always been a huge Marvel fan. I can't say I was there since the beginning because I actually only started watching them religiously I'm cinemas since the first Avengers film - everything before that I watched retrospectively on DVD or Bluray. But anyway the first Antman film I quite enjoyed, it was humorous and action packed without being too over-the-top. The 2nd Antman film - Antman and The Wasp - was mostly pretty good but I didn't really like backstory of the villain that much. That brings us to Quantumania aka Antman 3. Since Spiderman Far From Home, I personally feel the Marvel films have become mostly lifeless and unintelligent. Sadly, although not the worst of the post Thanos storyline films, Antman 3 is nowhere near as good as it's predecessors. You could argue the stakes are higher sure and the scale of the story is huge which it is but there's also nothing new being done here... they've added in Scotts daughter Cassy as a new Antman (Antgirl?) and she's just a pointless as a character if you ask me and verh forgetable even though they try make her funny and integral to the story. The returning characters don't seem to have any depth to them and in some cases appear to have changed personalities to when we saw them last so I felt cheated. The overall story also retcons what we knew of the quantum realm.... and it's all explained away with a ""this is different."" Seriously that's it. Another bad aspect of this whole film though was the poor CGI and design. Some characters were dead basic looking and boring whilst backgrounds were bland and at times noticeably fake taking me out of the movie. Anyway, there was a couple things I did enjoy and one of those was MODOK. I usually don't like it when films change character backstories but this I didn't mind at all because it made sense and it was hilarious. The other thing I liked was Kang. I liked how he was portrayed, I liked his design and I liked how he was powerful yet still noticeably vulnerable. Kang by himself is not a Thanos level threat but as we saw during the mid credits scene, I think an army of Kangs probably is!Final Verdict: It really only serves the purpose of introducing Kang to the MCU and admittedly, it does that very well. Everything else about it is mostly forgettable except for MODOK who steals the scene. It's not as funny as previous Antman films and also not as smart, characters act differently and the CGI can be very hut and miss.","

It doesn't make sense and Michael Douglas was just there to fly a ship and have an army of ants attack kang. It's Michael Douglas they could of something more with him. And modok, just no,no and no he wasn't really a good villain and the cg, ugh. The post credit scenes added nothing to the mcu, it was just advertisements for avengers 5 and loki, nothing was connected to the mcu. They need to find a different director for ant-man 4.","

"brandonmckay8","15 February 2023","Caught an advanced screening of this tonight & despite the negative reviews I had read this was pleasantly surprising for me. The blend of action, storytelling & comedy was much better balanced than recent Marvel films, the visual effects were beautiful, also much better than recent additions. I did enjoy the first two Ant-Man's better than this one but found this one was most definitely worth a trip to the cinema. Kathryn Newton very well casted for Cassie & adds well to the movie. Some moments with Scott were really beautifully done along with some humour, especially early on. Cassie's admiration for Jentorra was really cool & the 'just stop being a dick' to Darren (who returns in a funny way) was brilliant. Loved Paul Rudd's delivery of this line:
Kang: You're not the one with the hammer?Scott: That's Thor. We get confused a lot. Similar body types.Overall this movie is better than a lot of recent marvel films but not as good as the franchise once was. There are two credit scenes, one near the start of the credits & one right at the end.","

"adamsmith-51004","26 March 2023","Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10.","

"neilbowers","20 February 2023","Having read the reviews from the so called critics. You'd think that this is the worst ever Marvel film in the franchise.However, please ignore these critics because clearly they'd been watching a different film to what I watched this afternoon.Since we last saw Scott Lang a lot has changed in his life. He can't walk down the street without people recognising him and he has also brought out a book about himself being an Avenger.Scotts daughter is a chip off the old block in that she has been in and out of prison. However, rather than steel things Cassie uses her new found knowledge to do good.This is where we find that during the 5 years of the blip Cassie and Hank Pym have been building a contraption that fires a signal down into the Quantom Realm. Which as we find out later isn't a good idea.Having opened the door way via the contraption to the Quantom Realm out heroes are dragged in but split up and spend time looking for each other.The quantom realm is like no other and they soon discover that other unkown species live in this realm but live in fear of an individual.When they find out that Janet Pym is back things look bleak because having spent 30 years in the realm and managing to escape things are not good.There is a short but funny cameo from Bll Murray who meets a sticky ending which leads to the introduction of Kang (Johnathan Majors) who is hell bent on conquering all the realms across the multi verse and has already conquered the quantom realm.Once he realises that Janet is back he goes on the offensive to crush the rebellion that is beginning to build up and seak his revenge for Janet leaving the realm with him still in it.Helping Kang conquer the universe is an old adversary from Ant Man, Darren Cross who has now become M. O. D. O. K. (Mechanised Organism Designed Only for Killing) and he does have some of the funnier lines in the film as well.The characters within the Quantom Realm are funny at times and the relationship between Cassie and Scott is really sweet and it also seems as though Scott has gained some respect from Hank Pym too.I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, as you'll just have to wait until you go and watch it or wait for around 6 months before it appears on Disney +.The graphics etc. Are really good representing the Quantom Realm. The acting isn't as bad as some of the reviews will make you believe.It is a bit slow in parts but to be honest i've seen worse films in the Marvel Universe (Thor: Love and Thunder) being one. But, it's a solid start to phase 5. Critics have no idea, It's a really good film.","

"PaytonMArnett","19 February 2023","The first Ant-Man film was great, the second film was somewhat forgettable, and I feel this one will fall in line with the second one. The pacing and tone where off, Scott Lang got a lot of screen time, but the rest of the cast got comparatively little. The choice to tie MODOK into the first fill felt forced and strange. Paul Rudd was certainly the star, and was made the film worth watching. KANG was an entertaining villain, but didn't seem to belong in an Ant-Man film. The first Ant-Man worked so well because of its smaller scale, the large scale and shorter runtime did not work in this film's favor. The MCU is growing stale, but this shows I can still have a good time at the movies.","

"triadne","17 February 2023","This was really disastrous combination. The Antman films have come to be known for comedic moments so when they pivoted to such a serious story with such a supposedly threatening and monumental bad guy, you expect a tone change, but then along comes a certain character and brings down the whole thing with absolutely pathetic humour and the worst looking special effects I've seen in years. This is on the level of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, or Jar Jar Binks. It's really bad.Then there is the tropes that have become all too common for mcu movies at this point; large scale battle, cross cutting between individual characters, misplaced comedy... All detracts from at least one really powerful moment, that could have made the core of a fantastic movie, a moment when Scott regains his focus and works toward one goal rather than being drawn in all directions, that was very powerful.This is just the latest MCU product though and exhibits the same issues that I have been starting to notice in the past few years. At this point it's hard to ignore and it's stifling any creativity and good storytelling. This will probably be the last MCU movie I pay for.","

"brettkgraham","1 May 2023","Man oh man, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was so so average. This gimmicky kind of misplaced Marvel comedy is so redundant at this point. Also, how many times can Cassey and Scott hug before or after a fight in one movie. The best part of Ant-Man Came in the last 5 minutes. I feel like Marvel has done the bright cheery movies for too long at this point and needs to take their movies in a more serious (not necessarily dark) tone but definitely more serious. Tuning into a Marvel movie at this point you just know The formulaic movie that you're getting with not many surprises. Love Paul Rudd so I thought he was great. Jonathan Majors as Kang was great just like I said in Loki but with his personal battles I wonder what Marvel will do. Side note: total bs that Flash is getting RAVE reviews when Ezra Miller is an absolute legit psychopath and Jonathan Majors is being disbanded over accusations that have been dropped. Back to the movie: wasn't huge on the CGI/ scenery. Wasn't huge on the acting. Wasn't huge on the storyline. Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania gets a 6.6/10 for me. I'm on the edge of my seat for Guardians Of TheGalaxy to get Marvel back to that 8+ rating it so routinely sat at for me. Marvel has to step it up at this point as DC appears to be on their heels.","

This movie doesn't have a direction, it starts shooting towards all directions in hopes to some of each succeed. That, unfortunately, didn't happen. Of course, I am delighted to watch an Ant-Man movie once again, and have the chance to watch Loki and a glimpse of his return? That kind of scrambled my emotions. Because I really enjoyed the Loki TV show and the path it has gotten. Sincerely, when I witnessed KANG THE CONQUEROR, the man who saw all possible futures and endings were defeated by some very smart ants. I just wanted to leave. But I stayed in hopes to watch Loki, which happened, So, a fair trade.","

"ostlerb-02853","27 February 2023","Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me.","

"inactivekick-76609","22 February 2023","Marvel has given us tribute stories for some of their other fabled characters, so it seems only apt they sent the Ant-Man out with a pretty decent closure tale.Sending the main entourage of characters back to the Quantum Realm sets the ideal stage: as it also (finally) gives Ant-Man fans a far deeper look and exploration of the Quantum Realm, and much about its history, peoples (human or not), and secrets it may be harbouring for certain characters.On that basis alone, i think the director and story-line creators did an admirable job of finally cluing us up on the mysterious realm we had previously heard so much about but had nary a clue about. So mission accomplished, and done so rather nicely.Without the hitherto spoilers, it's notable to mention that the ""Super Boss Villain"" of this particular excursion into Quantum Land, kind of steals the show, as he excels as easily the best character portrayal in this entire movie. That said, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and other Earthlings do make fairly good plot fillers.All together this is everything we've come to expect from Marvel, and is nice end to the Ant-Man trilogy.A fun and exciting watch, for sure ;)","

Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come.

In Reality, when there's a stampede at a theater, shopping mall or soccer game on Planet Earth, people begin being crushed to death once they're stacked three deep. Humans do NOT have exoskeletons like insects, so they cannot survive endless piling on as do ants and other creepy crawlies. Humans are comparatively fragile, and they scream in pain as they're being trampled to death. Such verbalizing is strangely absent from this scene during ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUM-MANIA. Apparently the filmmakers give their clones feelings--such as the self-righteous jealousy voiced prior to the implausible pyramid building--only when it suits their ludicrous plot.","

"bobireshkov","15 April 2023","I enjoyed Quantumania, it was very visually stunning, the quantum realm looked great, and I like the star wars-type style.Ant man and the Wasp get new suits, they are my favorite suits by far.Cassie also gets a suit, and the new actress Kathryn Newton looks perfect for an older version of Abby Ryder Fortson's portrayal. The only problems i have with Cassie's character is the dialog with Darren and the fact that she can use the suit, but there were no scenes of her learning it.The main role of this film was to introduce Jonathan Majors's Kang, and it was great, he nailed that role. The only problem was that he was't an unstoppable treat, but he will be in Kang's Dynasty. The advanced ants beating Kang makes sense from a writing perspective, it's an Ant man movie after all.Kang not wanting to go and get his part in the probability storm makes sense, he destroys timeliness and he wouldn't want to meet infinite versions of himself there.Darren coming back as Modok was interesting, he was obviously a giant head, which is weird standing next to normal humans, but he looked good, especially during his dead scene, you could really see the well made cgi in his skin and blood. The main thing people are mad about is that Modok wasn't taken seriously, and it is true. The writer himself said that Modok couldn't be serious because of his look, he was simply brought from the dead to die again in this movie,but the way I see it, this doesn't have to be the main Modok. They can still bring him as his own character, they can make him more serious and dark, and in the multiverse everything is possible.I was happy to see a Loki season 2 update in the post credit scene, it's my favorite mcu show at the moment, I am happy that there is more ov it coming soon.The council of Kangs was unexpected for me, it was a great post credit scene, that makes me wonder, who will be the main Kang? I know it will be Jonathan Majors, but I am not sure if it will be the same Kang or a slightly different version.Overall, I think this is a good stats to phase 5, and I really enjoyed the movie.The only things they could change, in my opinion, is adding more scenes of Cassie training with the suit, more scenes of bonding time between Hank Pym,Hope and Cassie, and maybe more action of Modok.","

"JayWolfgramm","21 May 2023","The movie has a lot of little problems. Problems that, on their own wouldn't be all that distracting. In a better put together film, most could write them off as ""nitpicks"". But when the story and characters are not engaging enough, these little problems really add up, and the movie suffers death by 1000 cuts.The ""Quantum Realm"" is not that visually interesting. It looks like all the actors filmed their scenes separately on a green screen. The realm itself is just a series of browns and oranges like an old dusty screw. You don't get any sense of size in this movie. When Ant-Man is in the real world he will interact with objects we are familiar with. We know he is big because he is compared to a boat or an airplane. In the Quantum Realm there is no scaling. There is a scene where two characters are supposedly giant, but since they are just the same size as each other, they look like normal people.Back when Janet was in the Quantum Realm, she helped out Jonathan Majors fix his ship. But then she discovered that he was evil. How did she discover this? For some reason his spaceship is fueled by his mind...so Janet touching the ship made it so she could read his mind. Not very well explained and it doesn't make much sense. Feels like the writers were hoping to come up with an explanation later but just never did. They needed her to find out he was evil, so she just found out, end of story. A big plot point surrounds the idea that Janet doesn't want to tell any of her family about this interaction. Why? The movie tries to imply that she feels guilty or traumatized about it. But I don't buy it, it is just so drama can happen between Hope and Janet, otherwise Hope has nothing to do in this movie.MODOK is terrifying for all the wrong reasons. Every time he is on screen, I am immediately wanting him to leave. His character arc also makes no sense.Speaking of things that make no sense, Jonathan Majors' powerset fluctuates wildly depending on what the plot demands. It seems like he should win easily, but then when the third act approaches, suddenly he makes a lot of stupid decisions and is capable of killing everyone except for the main characters.Cassie is super annoying. She is a self-righteous, entitled know it all that keeps getting vindicated.I liked Jonathan Majors in the movie. And unlike other Marvel movies, I actually was fine with the comedy in this movie. It was an appropriate level of humor for this character. I enjoyed that the movie does not waste much time in getting the story going. The story begins and ends with a good pace.Overall, the rules of their world don't add up. Characters seem to change with no believable motivation. Some characters are just annoying. The visuals are unappealing. So yes, a lot of these could have been forgiven but it is all the small things the movie does wrong. Of all people, Ant-Man should know the power of small things.","

Here I was after a long day from sitting infront of a computer working from 7 am to 3 pm (I'm a Data Technician with speciality in programming) and thought I would go home and enjoy myself with this movie without watching neither reviews or spoilers and turned out to be my biggest mistake. This was God-awful. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Didn't make me laugh like the first Antman movie did, hell even the 2nd one. The pitiful attempt at humour bordered on cringe almost. It was so uncomfortable. Also the acting from some of the actors (looking at you, Michael Douglas) were so terrible.I'm sorry for the rant, all in all, I do not recommend this movie to even my worst enemy. Skip this one fellas and girls.","

"rizwanyasin","18 February 2023","After reading some reviews, I thought it's going to be terrible and was expecting disappoint. However, it was actually decent movie. J Major did a awesome job playing Kang. Also if you've watched Loki season 1 on Disney then you'll understand the story line much better. I do feel like they could have taken a bigger risk with the story line. There are two end credit scene, I believe it was worth it staying for the first end credit scene but not the last end credit scene. All it did was setup a Disney plus series.My final advise would be to rewatch Loki season 1 before going to watch quantanmania.","

"ryanmo-35178","11 March 2023","Waited for long to watch ant man again, but how come I am so disappointed? Ant man was the most unnoticed hero in the avengers, and he is still one in this movie. The story is most about the hidden adventure of Michelle, and to evolve the next big boss (Kang), how come the plot become so unrealistic? I was so bored in the middle and wanna the movie to finish asap. The fighting scenes are not attractive and the big boss is so weak (even I know there are so many replicates of him at last). Cannot think too much good things Inside (except his pretty gal and the funny telepathy man). Really hope the plot can be better and the next universe can become better. Miss those original avengers movies...","

"jtkwtc","23 April 2023","Ok Marvel/Disney, after so many movies rehashing the same tired story tropes is getting tiresome. The movies remind me of 80s action movies where bad guys can't hit a single target and they never immobilize the good guys so they can escape 4 times before the finale. Oh wait...they pause to espouse gibberish to allow the ""heroes"" to alter their fate. This movie was predictable and dull.Without much humor and too many similar leads without much charisma it is a waste of the cast and the budget.I also saw many similarities to Star Wars with lots of locale animations. I won't even mention the ending....makes no sense.","

"fluffset","16 February 2023","I do not know , I feel it lacks some humanity, maybe because there is too much computer-generated-image (C. G. I) visual that makes this movie looks like more ""cartoon"" than a live-action movie. I love ""Ant-Man 1"" and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp 2"", I can watch both movie a lot of time, its so fun and exciting. But this one? I do not know why, too much computer-generated-image (C. G. I) visual make it lacks something. More modern our times, more weirder our movie looks like. We still need the touch of humanity and natural background, I respect the actor and actress who struggle with the green and blue stuff to appreciate their character (they get paid well too), but yeah, too much C. G. I.","

"lltgeorgej","1 October 2023","The thing about this movie, for me, and I am not sure if a lot of other reviewers feel this way consciously..or it's only something so subtle they are not really aware of it.It's the daughter, the actress, the character ..uhm. The whole smugness of her. Like, to me this ruins the film. No offence intended to anyone. I am sure they all did their best.Paul Rudd is cool and a nice guy as is generally the case somehow.Anyway. Without getting into the whole dynamics and storyline. To me this element of the daughter and her character in the film is what creates this sort of feeling, like.. do I really want to be watching this? It's just so noticeable. The film was enjoyable right up until exactly the point she enters the film. Which is very early on.Okay. Just wanted throw this out there. I hope she goes on to do great things. The actress, sorry I didn't even look up her name.It's all about the vibe.","

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","22 June 2023","This was another of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'll be honest, I've been checked out of the last ones as it feels like they are just introducing characters and not progressing to a major story. That is until this one. What I will say though is that I've enjoyed my time. It just hasn't inspired me to want to continue watching the MCU output. Something else is that Ant-Man and The Wasp make fun movies, especially since I like Paul Rudd.Now for this one, we are after the events of Endgame. Life has gone back to semi-normal. Scott Lang (Rudd) is happy with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). They have a makeshift family with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). Hank is working with Cassie who wants to know more about the Quantum Realm. Janet doesn't want to talk about it and is closed off there. Cassie is also getting into trouble as she is socially conscious.Cassie created a device that can search the Quantum Realm. This gets this group into trouble as they get sucked in. It is now that Janet reveals what she did when she was trapped there. She met someone else in a similar situation. She helped them, but she saw what was in their heart. Also, what their plan is if they ever get out. This character is from the future and named Kang (Jonathan Majors). He is behind the Langs, Van Dyne and Hank getting sucked into the Quantum Realm.That should recap and get you up to speed with what this movie is doing. What I'm glad about is that we finally get who our next major villain to replace Thanos, Kang the Conqueror. I don't know much about this guy. What I do know is that it makes people excited. This seems like it fits since Kang is a time traveler who is destroying other timelines in the multiverse. I'm excited to see where things will go now.Outside of introducing this villain, this was my least favorite of the Ant-Man movies. It isn't the acting. Rudd is solid along with Lilly, Douglas, Pfeiffer, Majors and Newton. If anything, Rudd doesn't bring as much humor as normal. We get back Corey Stoll in an odd role. I love that they used M. O. D. O. K. The execution on screen though wasn't great. We also got a cameo from Bill Murray which was wild. I also liked Katy M. O'Brian, William Jackson Harper and the voice of David Dastmalchian. The acting is solid, but it takes a backseat to the action and effects.I'll then finish this out with the filmmaking. What I'll give credit to here is creating this fictional and smaller world of the Quantum Realm. There is limitless things that can be done here. I'll also credit the effects. This is CGI heavy, but they do look good thanks to the Disney money. Not everything though. I do want to say that. Other than that, the action sequences are good and the soundtrack works.I'm recommending this to MCU fans who want to continue the story. I don't think this is a great film, but where it goes from here has my interest piqued finally.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","

"torgis","20 February 2023","I might be the last person on earth who doesn't compare every movie I watch to another, I feel like comparisons can ruin any movie for someone.I thought this one was a pretty good movie. I can't say there was a moment I remember where I was genuinely concerned for the main characters' well-being or safety, or any memorable ""emotion"" moment (but to be fair, that doesn't happen too often). I was a little annoyed with Janet for a good portion of it and I'm still not a huge fan. I liked Cassie, thought her character was a pretty good interpretation of the comic character, but much smarter. I agree it wasn't as light-hearted as previous Ant-Man appearances, but I think the situation warranted it. I loved Kang, thought that was done very well. Interested to see how it plays out in the long-run.","

"Silicone54","27 April 2023","I swore off all superhero movies but I like the a-list stars Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly etc. They do lend a bit of credibility to the film. But as with all these CGI films the story is given the least amount of effort.Half way into the movie I felt like I'm watching a glorified 70's kung fu film. Its just one fight scene after another. In the end, the underdogs champion over the more powerful enemy THE END.To me the Marvel characters really only have 1 or 2 movies in them. Unlike franchise heroes like Spiderman or Batman these 2nd tier heroes are not all that interesting or relatable.","

"dorMancyx","20 February 2023","""Phase Five"", ""Kang the conqueror"", ""multiverse"" --- it all sounds so monumental, but looks so tottering.Great visual effect (shout out to the VFX workers), as illustrated in a motley of scenic, architectural, and environmental designs; especially the long shot of the flight sequence, which captures the flamboyant otherworldliness of quantum realm. Action wise, the movie presents a short yet meticulous combat scene between Kang and the Ant-family, displaying tacit combos and fluent choreography. Moreover, giant Ant-Man demolishing the citadels is quite similar to AOT, and the way Kang suspends the hurtling cane gives me Kylo Ren vibes, not to mention the quantum species are really comparable to the aliens of Star Wars, which are all nice little allusions in my opinion but could be a sign of Marvel's creativity fatigue. And here goes the negatives.I'm sorry, but Cassie's actress is terrible at portraying her character, showing no emotions facially or within the eyes when her father falls off a cliff or gets beaten to death by the villain, which contrasts farcically to her anxious voice. Introducing terrible ""New Avengers"" is hereditary as we've seen in Phase Four (Iron Heart, Kate Bishop, America), which is why Stinger is even more frustrating and illogical of a character: unreasonably caring, doted by her family, and excuse me incited a local rebellion as a two-day visitor? Speaking of which, the rebels demonstrate so potent a motive with so little characterization, as they seem even less important to the plot development that actual ants. And speaking of ants, how in the flabbergasted-ness do ants overpower the timeline-shattering Thor-killing multiverse-conquering Kang? I understand how Jonathan Majors is grinding to perform this so-called ""ultimate antagonist"" of Phase Five and Six with contorted facial expressions and balefully imperious tone, yet Kang's failure in the film simply makes this villain far less menacing. Though titled ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", the movie leaves no room for Scott (I'm sorry Paul you tried) or Hope (basically Black Widow but only the stingers) to literally and figuratively ""grow"" as main characters. Michelle and Michael's chemistry is the only landing ground for comedy (oh yeah the jokes suck btw); though in terms of between-character scenes, I loved the backstory of Janet and Kang, as their brief interaction exhibits a mother's yearning and a warrior's sympathy with pure dialogues and micro-expressions, which in turn deepens the duo's contradiction.If this was a film of Phase Four, I'd let it slide with a 7/10. However, we're in a new Phase with new expectations, and the customers will not be satiated with Marvel serving the same meal as before.","

"macronnel","1 August 2023","This is a CGI, greenscreen heavy type of movie. I can only stand to watch for 30 minutes of this before tuning out (I was already struggling at 20 min). I understand that the setting is something of a different world, but its just nauseating, weird, tripping on acid type of strange world. I love all the actors as they are not given enough credit to use their imaginations as they interact with an empty space that is suppose to be an organism of some sort. The action scenes makes me even less invested in the movie as there is no real sense of danger. Like most super hero movies, they are very predictable. I'm sure I'm not within the target demographic of this movie and it's my fault for thinking it can be enjoyable for all ages. This is a kids movie that was intended to excite wonder and imagination so I will encourage anyone else over the age of 9 to skip this one.","

The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army.","

"noahbmayfield","17 February 2023","Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either.","

"Web_Of_Doom","18 June 2023","Only worth watching once, as far too many Directorial & script errors.It starts out OK-ish but gradually it becomes more & more disjointed.Peyton Reed the Director was another poor choice by Disney to have direct this film as he was unable to bring the poor script together, as so many times scenes needed a more believable reaction from all of the characters in the film. However instead it was a series of incidents where very rarely did the characters react to their environment in a way that any normal human would, as this really takes you out of the film.Jeff Loveness the script writer chosen by Disney executives ( yet another jump on the bandwagon Rick & Morty TV series writer who just joined a successful TV show after it had already become successful ) clearly has no clue how to write for a big budget super hero movie.Why does the Disney executives keep picking the wrong people to direct & write scripts? ( it is like they actually want Marvel to fail ).Stan Lee & Larry Lieber wrote these characters not for children, but as real life characters that had super hero abilities thrust upon them but for some reason Disney think of these characters as ""childish"" so they hire people they think will write for ""children"". When will they realise not only do adults not want to watch movies written specifically for a child but guess what children are not dumb either & they understand a lot more than adults ( such as Disney executives ) give them credit for.Everyone ( children + adults ) want scripts that start of with intrigue, then through a series of events where people act in a logical & more importantly believable way get you to the pay off at the end of the film.The journey should be its own reward, because of what you learn.In this film you learn absolutely nothing of value, as it is pointless.The most important part of any film generally are the story arcs & also the character arcs where the characters actually learn & grow from their experiences along with the audience watching ( whether that be moral lessons or just learning more about the Marvel universe IN A BELIEVABLE WAY for future film interest, however Disney executives choose the wrong directors & even worse the wrong writers so have absolutely destroyed phase 4 as character arcs make little sense ).THIS ANT MAN 3 FILM ( A. M. A. T. W. Q. ) simply needs to be forgotten about as I feel so bad for the actor Jonathan Majors whose character is Kang the Conqueror, as this should have been his huge blockbuster hit. I think he makes a really good Kang & has potential as phase 4 needs to be written off mostly however keep the actors who deserve it. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeiffer are all huge stars ( who have proved many times they are fantastic actors ) so please Disney give them Directors & script writers they deserve who actually understand how a story should develop.The most important thing about any film is the story makes sense, then the story has to be interesting & hopefully it will also give you insight. You let the audience decide what they take from the film themselves.Each character has to act & react to each scene in a believable way or there needs to be dialogue ( or action ) that makes sense to make each scene potentially believable to maintain the audience suspension of disbelief, as they the audience will ride with you & the story telling so long as the writer & director can keep the story in the realms of truth.There was far too many scenes in this poor film where characters did not act in a way which as an audience member you would expect them to do so. This completely takes the audience out of the film & ruins the experience for them, as you can't believe in what you are watching.Kathryn Newton is a young actress with potential who's character Cassie Lang obviously has flaws thinking for example it is OK to go beyond peaceful protesting against the police ( doing their job & following the law ) by moving homeless people on from their choice of living illegally. As it is good the young character wants to live in a better world however harassing the police is not fair as they were doing their job so where is the character arc showing this character progression in this film ( it sends out the wrong message about how to protest as it is not the police's fault & they do not deserve their property vandalised ). At the end of the film Cassie Lang should have realised the police was not in the wrong ( for following the law ) & she should have apologised to the police officers after realising her initial views where far too simplistic & very young child-like ( naive ) in blaming them, as actually homelessness is a much more complex issue & the law keepers actually need better laws to uphold that would help the homeless. Thus she used her power against the wrong people so should learn from that as then we would see her character progression & becoming maturer.Cassie Lang could have made amends & learnt from her immaturity.However unfortunately the script writer was obviously too immature & thinks it is cool to blame the police ( which is not really helping anyone & in fact is putting negative messages out to the audience of this film ).Disney need to hire more intelligent, more mature & better script writers who actually have a social conscience & understand character arcs.( that was just one example where a character could have matured ).Another phase 4 Marvel I will not buy & will pretend was never made.The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the magnificent CGI ( + 1 star from base 1 star = 2 stars ) + ( another 1 star = 3 stars total for the great actors who did their best to save the film. As an awful director & dreadful screen writer ruined a big budget movie with lack of talent.MARVEL FILMS NEED TO BE WRITTEN FOR AN INTELLIGENT AUDIENCE ( as children & adults are mostly intelligent so they will search out the best films with the most intelligent scripts & after they see this Ant Man 3 film they will be put off future Disney productions ).Disney used to stand for quality storytelling, now it stands for lacklustre storytelling so it's time Disney fire the people responsible for hiring these dreadful directors & abysmal screen writers to rebuild Disney.","

The rest, unfortunately the story phase is rather slow and boring. Fortunately, there are funny scenes typical of Ant-Man films and antagonist characterizations that make you laugh.This film cures our longing for the Avengers superhero character. There's a cameo wanting to portray Stan Lee's character; this part of the buying coffee scene is a light but punchy touch of comedy about people's perceptions of Ant-Man.","

"moatandbailey","17 February 2023","... corner of the MCU. Scientific jargon tends to flow easily enough through a fair share of MCU films, particularly the better and best ones. The purpose seems to be to ground the story into something concrete, tangible and accessible, some relatable terra firma to allow us the audience even further immersion into the viewing experience. It's a neat story-telling device, which Ant Man has employed through all his movies so far- culminating in no less than the term quantum mechanics being integrated into the title of his third outing. And so ""Quantumania"" perseveres in the long MCU tradition of playing fast and loose with austere scientific concepts to engage the audience in a wild fantastic evidently neverending adventure. ""Quantumania"" isn't MCU's best, but it upholds the MCU's most tried and true science fiction fantasy tradition. And just as in science, once all the phases come into play, the sum should amount to greater than its parts. Ant Man has now cast his part in the lot, to be tallied later down the line, and it is a good part, if a bit part, from the character most likely to be overlooked- except for one thing: quantum mechanics, applied and theoretical, is a huge deal..! So here's to Ant Man- the hero no one cares about, but can't do without...!","

Another villain made pointless in a useless movie, just like Namor in Wakanda Forever.There's no importance or deadliness to the Villains anymore. Now Marvel is starting to trash their best villains. Why? This is basically writers who have no idea how to write from Comic to Film or know anything about the characters.Instead of establishing Modok as a good character, he's another throw away joke villain. The character belongs with A. I. M, X-men and Captain American; what's he doing in an Ant Man movie?

Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU.","

"Smarmelade","17 April 2023","Man, I was a bit excited when they announced Quantumania. I like first Ant-Man, second movie was fine as well. I like Paul Rudd... but I kinda never liked they chose Scott Lang: as THE main Ant Man. I always thought Hank Pym, Ultimate version, was so interesting and they did nothing with it. Scott Lang is a blank slate, Paul Rudd playing Paul Rudd, Ryan Reynolds style. But it mostly worked, so fine, whatever.And then I watched this and it was boring, disappointing and main characters didn't grew a bit from the first movie. Script was subpar, boring, mostly not funny or interesting. Characters are completely whatever.It's so sad to see such an expensive movie, with so many visual artists crunching through sleepless nights so you can get a dumb, uninspired and visually incomprehensible movie at the end. Visually incomprehensible to the point of I didn't care one bit for it.Maybe the worst sin though - is to have a movie with this budget, about time travel, wacky physics, etc. And do absolutely nothing with it.Big man hits small man, small man hits big man, big or/and small man shoots lasers. Repeat, hit harder.That's about the extent this whole movie goes. This movie makes dr. Strange defeating Dormammu look like a genius level fight.Story and characters are THE KING of anything, if you don't have those, you have nothing of value. As is demonstrated here.","

"nogodnomasters","3 March 2023","Ant Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) enjoys his notoriety for saving the world. He has even wrote a book about it which is filled with puns about size. His daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) knows there is more work to do. Just because it doesn't effect you, doesn't mean that it isn't happening. Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner. Afterwards we discover Dr. Hank (Michael Douglas) has ants and Cassidy is sending signals into the quantum realm which literally sucks everyone in. This is how they managed not to pay the other high priced avengers. It appears Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) was not forthcoming about what went on there as we meet Bill Murray looking good for his age. The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!"" Kathryn Newton is the male teen heart throb and a female role model. They missed on the ending. Jonathan Majors should have been their waiter in the closing scene with ""Mr. King"" on his name tag.Guide: No sex or nudity. Use of the ""D"" word.","

Antman & the Wasp Quantumania suffers from a problem that is recurring throughout the MCU films, and that is tying up the 3rd act in a satisfying end. This is usually in large part due to servicing the ongoing plot that is the MCU. However, there is a very noticeable decline in quality of narrative in the 3rd acts of most Phase 4 & 5 projects, despite the huge money thrown on screen. It all feels too manufactured, than created.The acting is all good, with Jonathan Majors absolutely crushing the role of Kang. The problems really rested with, in some part, the direction and, in large part, to the writing.",NA
"SamC12","19 February 2023","I get it. The movie was weird and certain ideas were not executed well (MODOK...)I get why phase 4 was less appreciated by fans. They are taking risks and they are not going with safe ideas.Quantumania was a good movie, with a compelling villain, good visuals, great characters and well made humor.My main problem with the movie is the many shifts in tone that are not always smooth. Kang brings a seriousness that is really well made, but in the process, you loose some of the charm that first Ant-Man gave us. Other than that, I would rank it in the same place as the first Ant-Man and, better than the second.Give it a chance!",NA
"jboothmillard","25 February 2023","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has already gone through thirty-one movies and four Phases, this film marked the beginning of Phase Five, it was rated well by critics, so I was up for it, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, Yes Man). Basically, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has written his autobiography, Look Out for the Little Guy, which becomes successful, and he has settled with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Lost's Evangeline Lilly). Scott's teenage daughter Cassie (Freaky's Kathryn Newton) has become a political activist, and is constantly being bailed out of hail; she has become estranged from her father since he is focusing on his celebrity status rather than saving people as Ant-Man. While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. She turns it on, but Janet panics and forces it to be shut off. But the message has already been received, and suddenly the portal opens and pulls the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Hank explore a large city to find help. Hope, Janet, and Hank meet with Lord Krylar (Bill Murray), formerly an ally of Janet's, he reveals that things have changed since she left. Kang (Jonathan Majors), an exiled traveller Janet previously knew, now known as Kang the Conqueror, has become the ruler of the Quantum Realm, Krylar is working for him now. Hope, Janet, and Hank are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. Meanwhile, Scott and Cassie are told by rebel leader Jentorra (Katy M. O'Brian) that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. Soon, Kang's forces attack them, led by M. O. D. O. K. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing), who is revealed to be Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who survived his apparent death when he was previously Yellowjacket. Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Hank what really happened to her during her time in the Quantum Realm and why she never to return. She found Kang who she assumed was trapped alongside her, he claimed he could help them both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his power core capable of travelling through the multiverse. After they managed to repair it, Janet touched his chip and had a vision of Kang's true thoughts, planning to conquer and destroy entire timelines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his own variants (versions of himself) who feared him, and Janet turned on him. Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core and render it unusable. Kang eventually regained his powers and conquered the Quantum Realm some time after; Janet had been fighting him ever since until her rescue. Scott and Cassie are taken to Kang, who threatens to kill Cassie if Scott does not help get his power core back. Scott is taken to the core's location and shrinks down. Scott finds himself surrounded by variants of himself and is almost drowned, bur Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang goes back on the deal, capturing Janet and destroying her ship. Hank returns, having been rescued by his ants, they were also pulled into the Quantum Realm, they grew in size and rapidly evolved into hyper-intelligent beings; Hank helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to go against Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie appeals to Cross's human side that he can change his ways for the better good. Cross is convinced to turn sides and fight Kang, though he sacrifices himself in the process, and dies from his injuries. Janet repairs the power core allowing the group to return home. But while she, Hank, Hope, and Cassie jump through the portal, Kang attacks Scott, nearly beating him into submission. Hope returns to save Scott, together they destroy the power core with a combination of Pym Particles, Kang is knocked into, causing him to be pulled into oblivion. Cassie reopens the portal to return home with Scott. Having returned, Scott resumes his life, he momentarily questions something Kang said about something terrible that will happen, but he brushes it off. In a mid-credits scene, numerous variants of Kang are concerned by the increasing interest in the multiverse on Earth-616 and plan their uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Mobius M. Mobius (Owen Wilson) locate another Kang variant, named Victor Timely, on Earth in the 1900s. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Veb, William Jackson Harper as Quaz, and Randall Park as Jimmy Woo. Rudd returns as the insect-sized hero with some wisecracks, Lilly is fine as his love interest fellow costumed heroine, Pfeiffer and Douglas have their moments, and Majors is well cast as the villain intent of taking over. The story just about holds up as the characters enter the subatomic universe below our own, the special effects to create the alien creatures and landscapes are brilliant, the fight and chase sequences are suitably exciting, and there are some amusing moments. The multiverse concept means infinite possibilities for where it will go next, this sequel is certainly entertaining, admittedly there is a bit to get your head around sometimes, but overall this is a worthwhile superhero fantasy action. Good!",NA
