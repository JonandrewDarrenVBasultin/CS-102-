"04GreatFlick","2 July 2023","That was fantastic! It had a great opening. Great action sequences. The de-aging parts were not an issue to me. I barely noticed and really the action around it was too awesome and fun to even care about it. I had an ear to ear grin the entire time! Not sure what other critics were expecting or watching. For me this movie had a certain checklist:Fun ✅
Action ✅
Indy being Indy ✅
Mystery ✅
Memorable characters ✅
Humor ✅It's not perfect or the absolutely best film in the series but it's also not the train wreck that it's being made out to be. Best advice is always to just to watch it and judge yourself. Great flick!","10/10"
"13Funbags","29 August 2018","I will only say that this movie is twice as long as it should be and has way too many characters. I won't even try to guess why they did that. I love Marvel and have a huge tolerance for bad movies, but by 29 minutes in I was ready to give up. If all the bad stuff had been cut out this would have been a great 90 minute movie.","10/10"
"3DForMe","5 March 2023","Aside from Paul Rudd having a romantic relationship with someone who looks exactly like him in this movie, this has been such a bad installment to, not only the Antman franchise, but to the MCU, PERIOD.Then again, most movies from the MCU in the past few years have not been up to par with their predecessors.Into the Quantum Realm... we get Disney crossing their franchises and making another terrible Star Wars movie. There really wasn't much fun in this movie as the previous ones. I love Antman and was so excited when they first introduced him, and they totally dumped on it.Modok...REALLY!?! How did they put that out like that? Terminator 2 was released before CGI took over the movie industry and had WAY better looking CGI than this.Kang. He was cool, but there has been so much buzz around his the actor stole the show with his portrayal, but I think anyone in that role would've made the movie exactly the same.Michael Peña...is NOT in the movie which has been such a great addition to each of the other Antman movies and an absolute fan favorite...but it seems the fans aren't who they're trying to please, here.Cassie...whatever. Really nothing particularly special about her character or the actress, herself.Seriously...SERIOUSLY just so disappointed in what Marvel has been doing lately. Just ruining everything.","6/10"
"3xHCCH","9 January 2013","I have just finished reading the book the other day, and today I got to watch the film version. With the book still so fresh in my head, I went into the cinema with very high expectations. This is specially so after reading and hearing reviews which call Ang Lee's cinematic masterpiece visually comparable to ""Avatar"" or emotionally comparable to ""The Little Prince,"" as well as all of the awards buzz.The book for me was a pleasant though slow read because of the lengthy wordy, even flowery, descriptions Yann Martel uses for his languid reflection on zoo life, his comparative study of Hindu, Christian and Moslem philosophy, and of course, his survival tale at sea by a teenager and a Bengal tiger sharing one lifeboat. It waxes philosophical in the beginning, then waxes fantastical in the middle, before settling for dry reality at the end. While a movie could probably improve on the imagery for each scene, there are several key parts of the novel that would entail a lot of narration. On the big screen, too much narration cannot be too good.My first assumption turned out to be true. The cinematography and visual effects were expectedly first rate and excellent. Those camera angles were breathtaking. The colors were very vibrant. The special effects regarding animals were realistic for the most part, especially the land mammals, particularly Richard Parker. Though I have to say that the water creatures were too obviously computer-generated, not too good. A most triumphant sequence in the film for me were the scenes on the floating green island of algae and meerkats. I thought that was ideally visualized and executed, so much better than that chapter of the book.My second assumptions also turned out true. A lot of the story needed to be narrated by an adult Pi Patel as he was being interviewed by a novelist researching for his next book. These bookending present day scenes were pretty dry for me. The whole last chapter of the book when Pi was interviewed by the Japanese shipping officials was all one long narration only without supporting imagery. All of this talky narration may be boring for some people. In order to make the film appeal to more people, Ang Lee spares us from gory details which the book was not averse to describing in graphic detail. In the film, the screen time of the zebra, orangutan and hyena was very short. For all the brutality that was supposed to have happened on board, Ang's lifeboat remains almost pristine white. I thought that was quite merciful of Ang. I wish I could also say the same for some sappy melodramatic scenes, like Richard Parker laying his head on Pi's lap, which were not in the book.Overall, this film version of ""Life of Pi"" is very good, but it can be disappointing for people who have read the book. It was a loyal albeit sanitized version of the book, which is not really a bad thing. The book was not exactly inspirational to me, more educational actually. For this film, Ang Lee seemingly aspired to make this movie inspirational, and these obvious efforts may prove to backfire for some audiences.","10/10"
"593PMP","19 June 2018","I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.","5/10"
"661jda","1 July 2023","Thank you for bringing Indy back-after the last one, I thought you buried him. As long as Harrison Ford is around, you can always bring up an Indiana Jones saga. I'll never say anything bad about Ford's performance as Jones. Honestly believe he should have at least been nominated for RAIDERS. He never fails to please and does so again here. But the story is uneven. Sometimes speeding manically along and then when it slows down--it stops. Bringing in Waller Bridge was a good idea to keep the story lively although I'm not convinced so much of her conversion from thief at the end. Maybe the next will push her back to the dark side and the emergence of a new ""indy junior"" would be a good thing. Mads is a good villian-you will really want to hate him at one point. Unfortunately, Teddy is no Short-Round. He lacks the likeability and thats a hole in this story: he's not charismatic nor is he really likeable so you almost don't care what happens to him other than he is integral to saving Indy and Wombat towards the end. Indiana Jones is a character that really shouldn't die: he is the 1930s version of Luke Skywalker: to make him go away will almost be unAmerican, but we need to get to another hero and the next jones should be the bridge that this one wasn't. Still - I would rather pay money to see this flawed jones than pay money to see half the films that are also coming out this year.","1/10"
"851222","16 July 2017","Greetings from Lithuania.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017) is amazing movie. It perfectly ended this trilogy and left me wanting for more. I do hope they will create another trilogy this time focusing on humans, but seeing what incredible movies they made about apes, i want them to me great characters as well.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is easily one of the best movies i saw this year. The craftsmanship of this movie is nothing short of amazing. Special effects were simply flawless. Not great or amazing - they were perfect. Not for a second did i thought that i was watching CGI creations in front of me - they were there, apes, with all of emotions and etc. Andy Serkis is amazing in here. Steve Zahn stole every scene as a Bad Ape - couldn't take my eyes of him - what a movie magic. Screenplay was great, deep and dark - this is a dark movie and although it is rated PG-13 its theme is more in common with ""Apocalypse Now"" - starting from theme, mood and Woody Harrelson performance which more then once remanded me of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. Overall, once again - ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an amazing motion picture. There so many quite scenes between apes that i kinda wished they just kept going. Directing by Matt Reeves was more then great - he is truly a force in Hollywood that should be get more recognition - can't wait to see his take on solo ""Batman"" movie. Cant' recommend this movie any higher - great movie.","7/10"
"851222","17 March 2013","Greetings from Lithuania.To say ""Life of Pi"" is one the two best movie of 2012 is to say nothing. This is visually most stunning film i've seen in years, yes in years. There are some breathtaking scenes of skies and waters capes, animals an almost entirely CGI created tiger (Richard Parker) makes for an amazing character.I was like a kid while watching this movie and i can't recall when the last time that happened.I'm so stupid that didn't see this movie in a theater. I watched blue ray on my projector, and that was incredible stuff (the 2:35 aspect scene is also a thing of beauty).Overall, watch this masterpiece on the biggest screen you can find, this is a movie for ages.","9/10"
"851222","18 August 2018","Greetings from Lithuania.""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then ""Terminator 2"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.Overall, ""Infinity War"" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there. At the end i liked this picture and will check the 2nd part as well.","1/10"
"851222","25 December 2023","Greetings from Lithuania.""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" (2023) is a fun movie for a boring evening - or two. Two because at its running time 2 h 18 min this movie did drag. With a plot like this which was used and seen many times in different movies, the only thing that saved this movie for me was its technical stuff. This film is very impressive, special effects were solid and setting were great. There is a lot of action, and you have to leave a logic behind the door when watching it. The third act it basically Looney Tunes type of movie - the ridiculousness is on a next level here. But again, plenty of action, fun chase sequences, and sere scope of this film left me impressed.Overall, for me personally from all 5 movies this one is in number 4 - behind it is the one with aliens. ""Dial of Destiny"" is definitely not a bad movie and it looks spectacular - for example the de-aging effects in the opening sequence are simply perfect. What it lacks is better story and the ending was kinda meeehhhh. But for one evening this movie does its job - it entertains.","8/10"
"A_Different_Drummer","1 February 2024","... is that Jason Statham at 56 still has it and so does director David Ayer. The two combined forces to develop a story that can best be described as ""every film Charles Bronson ever made with software revisions by a programmer called John Wick."" The action starts almost immediately and then just goes. If you like memes and themes with your action, then there are some scenes where the importance of being nice to older people pop up, and also also some talk of the importance of being a good person. But all that is just talk. At the end of the day (and by the end of the film), the action takes center stage. It helps if you know the filmography of both Bronson and Statham (which would help you relate to the ""be nice to old people"" meme), but you can also enjoy a cold viewing if needs be. Very little wokeness here, an added bonus. The good old days... ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"aarathiajit-02903","1 July 2023","A good movie is something that entertains you at the moment. A great movie is one that stays with you way after the screen turns black. Never have I felt this passionately about a superhero movie before. Every frame was breathtaking. The use of colour to convey each emotion was phenomenal. It was a rollercoaster of emotions with a soundtrack that did not stop amazing me. The humour, the wit, the subtle messaging, I could watch this one a million times. My personal favourite scenes where the one with Gwen and her dad and the one with Gwen and Miles pictured to Monalisa. But the whole movie was remarkable. It truly won my heart.","10/10"
"aaravsengar","3 September 2023","So, I recently caught the newly released Indiana Jones movie, and if I'm being honest, it left me feeling quite underwhelmed. Personally, I found it rather dull and boring, and given its runtime of almost 2:30 hours, that's a lot of time to be uninterested. While there were a few fleeting moments of fun, the film mostly adhered to the same old Indiana Jones formula without bringing anything genuinely new to the table.One of the biggest disappointments for me was the CGI. In this age of advanced technology, I expected better. Unfortunately, the visual effects often felt subpar and failed to create the immersive experience I was hoping for in an Indiana Jones movie. It's a shame because the franchise has a history of breathtaking practical effects, and this installment seemed to rely too heavily on CGI.The addition of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, while talented in her own right, didn't quite fit the classic Indiana Jones concept. Her character felt out of place in the adventure and action-packed world of Indiana Jones. It's not a knock on her acting abilities but rather a question of how well her character integrated into the established narrative.On the bright side, the acting from the rest of the cast was decent. Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role did bring a sense of nostalgia, and he handled the physicality of the role remarkably well. However, the screenplay didn't do him any favors in terms of character development or depth.Overall, if you find yourself with absolutely nothing to do and are a die-hard Indiana Jones fan, you might want to give this movie a shot. It's got the name and some familiar elements, so it might scratch that nostalgia itch. But if you're looking for a fresh, exciting take on the Indiana Jones saga, this one might leave you feeling unsatisfied. Personally, I'd rate it around 5.5 stars - it's watchable but far from memorable.","8/10"
"aarongnr","24 April 2019","It wouldve been easily the most epic comic book movie ever. (It still is for many parts)Not gonna go into huge spoilers for this one, just gonna say that the story was brilliant. It was SO well executed.What really annoyed me about this movie were 3 things:
1) Thor being a complete laugh
2) Fortnite (seriously Marvel? thats just sad)
3) Cap being able to wield Thors hammer all of a sudden for no reason at all. (Time travel makes it reconsider whos worthy it seems?)oh and 4 - 14000000) Fortnitehave a good one","8/10"

"abcvision","5 January 2013","Pi Patel is a rambunctious boy, who is wise beyond his years. He seeks the truth in life and in the spiritual world.In the Life of Pi, Pi is caught in a wild adventure as in a twist of unforeseen events he ends up literally the turbulent waters of the ocean with his wits and accompanied with a tiger. Directed by Ang Lee and based on the novel by Yann Martel, this movie is beautiful and mystical that opens the door to a world of possibilities. This movie has what is expected from an Ann Lee movie, full of color and the scenes are larger than life. It is a touching tale and will definitely be a Lee classic.","9/10"
"abcxyz-94493","27 November 2023","#4 was so god awful that #5 seems great by comparison. Great seeing Ford again as Indy. None of the other characters work so well (except Mads' character - he's always a great villain). The female lead was not likable enough (nor attractive enough IMO). The plot was convoluted...and when it wasn't is was just a big non-stop chase. What the movie lacked most was comedic touches. If you look at a list of the director's movies they are all kind of depressing. Logan. Cop Land. Almost zero comedic touches. Instead of Marigold imagine if Gunn had directed this? More than comedic touches the movie needs to be fun and adventurous. That's the whole point of the series - an homage to those old timey serial adventures set in exotic lands.","7/10"
"abdelazeeme","31 January 2024","I won't say it's the movie of the year but as Jason statham movie , it's very entertaining and well done movie.I was willing to watch the movie in theater when I saw the trailer and for reasons beyond me I couldn't, so I just watched the movie at home and to be completely honest I wish I watched it on a the big screen. The movie has some plot stretches but for a movie that adapts the equalizer concept I wouldn't be surprised about a man that can take down the whole SWAT team on his own specially that's the whole point behind the story itself. The dedication of ""bees"" that mainly makes them a very essential part of our environment . The movie as a whole package is very good and was fun to watch and wouldn't hate to see a sequel to it , don't mind the haters that went into a Jason Statham movie expecting to watch Macbeth play's performance! If you like action movies that's definitely a movie worth watching.","9/10"

"abdulx","27 December 2012","This is the best movie in 2012 hands down, I HATE 3D, but this movie actually makes incredible use of 3D. No eye strain whatsoever and the effects feel right. This movie should be a benchmark for all 3D movies to come, and i hope future movie directors learn from it. The storyline is amazing, so magical and reflects the spirituality of India and its various religions. The CGI is beyond incredible.This movie destroy's the hobbit's 3D (which was terrible). I strongly recommend everyone to go see it , DO NOT MISS IT. and watch it 3D (even if you hate 3D), do not see it in 2D , i just can't imagine this movie to work in 2D and Ang Lee said it himself, that this movie just doesn't work in 2D and he's so right. Trust me, this is coming from a strong disbeliever in 3D movies (i hated Avatar 3D btw), but THIS IS IT, this is the movie that defines what movies will look like in the future.","9/10"
"Abdulxoxo","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","10/10"
"abidsuhail","23 November 2012","With all the hype of a bestseller novel turning into a 3D movie, Life of Pi would possibly be the highly overrated movie of the year. Of course, it greatly impresses with its verisimilitude of the digital imagery, which is painstakingly constructed with one step on the fantasy and another on reality. I think this is so far the best imagery shot/created for a oceanic film and Richard Parker, the tiger is a marvel. Though, I was initially disappointed with the narrower aspect ratio 1.85:1; would've been more spectacular in 2.35:1But, where the movie (and the Novel) falls in its entirety is the drama, which is said to be constructed in tangence to spiritual overtones which justifies the Indian milieu ; the so called philosophy it offers is so very juvenile and text-bookish, (at-least that's how it would be for an Indian); the characters so flat and sketchy and casting over the top, detailing really bad and the authenticity in the soup (Tamil Talkie parts especially). Wondering if they hired a (right) cultural consultant. And this makes the first 25 minutes terrible to watch. Yes, all this is supposed to be carried from the original content by Yann Martel (which I consider an Yawn inducer).Having read the book and unimpressed, my only reason to watch Life of Pi in cinemas was Ang Lee. The man, in one of his interviews has said, he did have an initial hesitation and did contemplate a lot before taking up this project. I think one has to follow their intuition in creative matters and wish Ang Lee did that.So, if you've read the book, you know what to expect plot wise, and you'd be anticipating Ang Lee's visual interpretation, which is sure to enthrall you. And if you have not read the book, even better, the anticipation of 'where is this leading' might keep you engaged; only that at the end when the destination arrives, you might be left unsatisfied. 5/10 for the visual magnificence.","10/10"
"Abir-Xtreme","15 December 2018","When Dragon Ball finally returned after its big hiatus with Battle of Gods, the expectations and the excitement were both at their zenith. Unfortunately, it failed to hold onto it with the poorly directed and somewhat unoriginal Resurrection of F. What followed was even worse with a poorly scheduled animated series that threw the animators between a rock and a hard place. The result was mass disappointment and criticism for the once beloved franchise and it wasn't until the Zamasu arc did people start seeing glimpses of what was once adored. By the time the tournament of power arc rolled around, the animation quality had gotten up considerably and while the storytelling still needed some work the direction overall was better. In a way, Dragon Ball Super Broly is a reward for those who stuck by the series despite the issues because it conquers everything that went wrong before.Let us begin, up first I would like to get the bad out of the way. The only real problem I have with the movie is the incredibly bland retelling of the Dragon Ball Minus Manga. It is by far the least creative thing Toriyama has ever produced and it hurts me a bit that they did not keep the original Anime's take on things. However, that being said it was a fun experience to see Goku's mother Gine finally drawn out in front of us. Couple that with Toei's attempt to pay some homage to the original Bardock story with a very similar demise and it does give the older fans something to feel good about early on. The other negative is the sudden super realistic CGI that is used between all this amazing 2d animation, which can kick you out of the immersion if you notice it for a bit.Now let us focus on the actual movie and see what it offers, the general idea of the story is to connect a line between our main characters Goku and Vegeta with the new and improved Broly. When I say 'IMPROVED' I mean that in every send of the word. The little things with Broly before any of the action even begins is what actually makes you like him. Director Tatsuya Nagamine essentially split Broly into two beings, one is this curious and unsociable outcast that really just wants to be loyal to his father and feels disconnected from the world due to his unfortunate circumstances. The other side is shown during the intense action scenes when he sheds all emotion and turns into a savage monster that embodies everything from the original noncanon movie. This way you somewhat satisfy both the casual fans who want him to be the hulk of the franchise and those who wanted more depth in the character.Now the general plot without any major spoilers comes down to Freeza attempting to steal the Dragon balls yet again though this time for a far more ridiculous goal and while doing so, some of his soldiers come across Broly and Paragus who were outcast by King Vegeta out of sheer jealousy. They are convinced by Freeza that the best way to exact due revenge would be to travel to Earth and take down Vegeta, the eldest son of the late King Vegeta. Which automatically sets Broly on a collision course against Goku as well. They arrive on an icy land and so begins the battle. Here is where I would like to start talking about the animation and voice acting, for the longest time I looked at other animated Japanse shows like My Hero Academia, Mob Psycho and One Punch man and said to myself, how amazing would it really be If Dragon Ball could match that level? Well, I am glad to tell you guys that they have matched and exceeded our expectations for animation here. The kind of madness at display here is nothing but pure excellence. Which is expected when you have the likes Yuya Takahashi, Yuki Hayashi, Naotoshi Shida, Yoshihiko Umakoshi, Chikashi Kobuta and Ryo Onishi pulling the strings behind the frames. All this is only possible due to Naohiro Shintani freeing us from the shackles of Tadiyoshi Yamamura who had plagued the animated series with his poor designs. As for the voice acting, while I haven't had the pleasure to hear the English cast yet I can assure fans of the Japanese version that they bring out some of their best performances yet. Especially the voice acting of Katsuhisa Hôki as Paragus, he completely knocks it out of the park with arguably the most complex character. Aya Hisakawa, who had the incredibly hard job of replacing Hiromi Tsuru was also more than adequate. Other highlights include Nana Mizuki as Cheelai and of course Masako Nozawa for multiple characters.Overall, I am happy that Toei Animation finally took the steps necessary to evolve their most valuable series through this movie and I hope this continues in the years to come.Dragon Ball Super Broly is one of the best animated films of the year and provides you with Akira Toriyama's trademark humor and out of this world battles, which is only taken to the next level by the fantastic direction of Tatsuya Nagamine.","10/10"
"abirchy-96827","17 February 2023","At first I read the reviews before watching the movie. If anyone is reading this, then will now that most of the reviews are kinda bad. So I almost had no expectation before watching the movie... But after watching it my view changed...
I personally enjoyed it a lot....Phase-5 started with a blast!!!Spoiler Part :::::::
I think they didn't justify Modok too much like ""Taskmaster"" in Black Widow..But that's not a big problem as Modok is not the main villain,, Kang is... Kang The Conqueror's (exiled one) story and action scenes were greatly organized. I personally liked it... Some people may have problem with Kang being defeated in the end by Scott and Wasp.. I also personally think that shouldn't have happened as in the future Kang Dynasty will happen... But it's not like the end of the world. There are lots of good things in the movie.. Dialogues were also good....Midcredit scene really showed a clip of Kang Dynasty. Just waiting how Avengers will fight with all those Kang variants...Post credit scene will blow everyones mind. Our beloved Loki is back.. I am interesting to find out who actually that Kang variant is in the post credit scene as Who He Remains is dead.. Can't wait for Loki Season 2..","6/10"
"Abranth-d","19 July 2019","Here's my review of war for the planet of the apes . So once again Andy Serkis is back as Ceasar and he nails the role . The story is set right where Dawn left off , and despite being a very slow plotline , it still manages to keep you hooked. There is a lot of emotional scenes in this movie and Caesar faces too much tragedy like never before , but a better music score would've given a drive to the emotional scenes. The action scenes had less screen time than the prequels , but had , better CGI and choreography. Woody Harrelson was great as the bad guy , and his arguement with Caesar raises a lot of philosophical questions. The best thing about this movie is that it makes you root for the apes even though you're Human. In the end , "" war "" is an ape-tastic movie with ape-tacular action , great characters , a very slow plotline and a perfect end to a perfect trilogy.","10/10"

"academic-drifter","16 January 2024","The origin of this revenge fantasy isn't hard to imagine. My guess is that the writer (whose track record in recent years consists largely of writing scripts for completely unnecessary remakes of great action films) was persuaded to give money to a Nigerian prince or invest in NFTs, and decided to get payback by making them the villains of an action piece. Only having Jason Statham beat up a bunch of crypto bros seemed like an unequal contest, so he needed to up the stakes - with extreme prejudice.Thus we get a film in which a bunch of suspiciously well-organized scammers clean a sweet old lady (played by Mrs. Huxtable herself, so you know she's pure goodness) out of her life's savings. Unbeknownst to them, she rents out her barn to a beekeeper who decides to take revenge. Only he's not just a beekeeper, but a retired ""Beekeeper"", a former member of an ultra-secret elite extralegal organization created to maintain ""balance in the system"" by any means necessary, provided those means are violent ones. What could possibly be wrong with that?And with one phone call to his former employer, ex-Beekeeper Statham (his character has some typically generic name that is utterly unmemorable) gets needed information that federal law enforcement has been unable to obtain for years. And with it he begins to work his way up the chain to the very top, brushing aside with casual indifference challenges that would stymie anyone else. Armed thugs, SWAT teams, and ex-Special Forces operative are shrugged off with just a few moves. Injuries that would immobilize or even kill lesser people are mere annoyances to him, handled with a grunt and an application of a piece of cloth to some random part of his body. T-800s would envy such durability.More concerning is the recurring condition from which Beekeeper Statham has suffered that has caused him to internalize both his title and his pastime, to the point where every conversation with him degenerates into a series of beekeeping metaphors. Evidently this is a viral illness, as others he comes into contact with or who even learn of his existence soon spout the same inane analogies. With it comes a sort of resigned acceptance that all this murder and property destruction is necessary to protect ""the hive."" At this point Mrs. Huxtable has been forgotten five crimes scenes ago save by her daughter, who happens to be an FBI agent and who manages to figure out everything with the help of a beekeeping manual. Yes, it's like that.To be fair, if you like this sort of thing it's not the worst movie in the world. The ""system"" is saved, bad guys get their just desserts, and Beekeeper Statham lives to beekeep in the sequel (if any of this constitutes a spoiler to you, welcome to action films). The greatest crime on display in it, though, isn't the scamming or the murder or the property destruction, but the utter waste of acting talent, as several award-winning thespians are asked to do little more than deliver their lines on the way to cashing their checks. The only one who really threatens to run away with the movie is Josh Hutcherson, who plays a classier version of Donald Trump Junior with a degree of panache that threatens to make the movie fun. But then David Ayer's questionable camera angles and his need to showcase Statham's evident case of facial paralysis intervene to ensure that he does not prove to be the true hero of the movie by saving it from the tedium of predictability. But hey, at least scammers will think twice about scamming lest a Beekeeper gets them, right?","3/10"
"acdc_mp3","2 July 2023","I initially decided I was not going to see this movie based on how utterly horrible the last one was. I refuse to say the name of it. I decided it would be nice to see the movie with my wife so I went. I figured worse case would be I have a nice nap in the cool theater on a 105 degree day.The movie did started off with some CGI magic that usually puts me right to sleep, but this was pretty different and for the most part, kept my interest.The movie was built around a bunch of chase scenes that once again, usually put me to sleep, but they were short and to the point for which I was grateful.The story line is what held me and I found it intriguing. Let me put it this way: It was a million times better than the unmentionable piece of dung that was the previous installment.The movie was long, but it was very watchable and I did not take a restroom run even though I had to for the last hour.Harrison Ford's performance was much better than what I expected and the cliches were held to a manageable level.The rest of the cast did a solid job and there was no one who was annoying or took away from the movie in any way.Truth be told, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will see it again.","6/10"
"aciarleglio-1","1 July 2023","First of all the people saying it didn't need to be made, I will never understand why people can't just enjoy more movies on characters and themes they love. I feel like people always have this ridiculous level of expectations. It's Indiana Jones!!! It's adventure... It's action... suspense.... FUN! Remember when movies could just be fun without every part if it being ripped apart by couch critics??? That most likely have 0 creativity themselves. I really get disgusted by the fact that people can't just enjoy films for what they are. Entertainment. I thought this edition of Indiana Jones was exactly what I hoped for. Fun. Adventure. Nostalgia. Treasure. Borderline mystical. Great job to everyone involved making it. Now I hope they find a way to bring back a version of Indiana for future adventures. I don't care about people that complain about leaving alone what has been already done. I want more adventures. Much like James Bond, we can have more adventures even if it's not the same exact actor. Or create a new character to take up where Indy left off. Just lets have more adventures to remember.Just one real fan's opinion.","6/10"
"ACollegeStudent","13 December 2021","Rating: 8.6Not as good as Infinity war pacing-wise, but is a satisfying ending to the saga. High production quality, and a great soundtrack like its predecessor. The final fight did feel a little cliché (two armies brainlessly charging at each other for a typical smackdown). Not much to write about, it made every marvel movie before it worth the ticket.","8/10"
"ACollegeStudent","17 December 2021","Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","10/10"

"adamcomito","3 September 2023","Firstly I feel they've done well to capture the old feel of the Indy movies, something they missed with crystal skull. Perhaps because Shia LaBeouf isn't trying to steal every scene. I'm glad he's not in this one.People are too harsh on this film, remember nearly 40 years have passed since the original trilogy. I love seeing the old European towns, also feels a little more grounded in reality than the last installment. Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger and I'm glad they played him as age appropriate. I just wish we'd get more Indy films but sadly this could be the last for Harrison.I get nostalgic watching this film, a great and worthy finish to a great action adventure series. Something we don't get much anymore in modern cinema.","1/10"
"adamdaly1985","18 July 2017","I entered the theatre with a relatively open mind. I had recently seen 'Get Out' after my reluctance in being entertained by more leftist social justice propaganda had somewhat subsided. And I was incredibly surprised. I loved the film! Yes, there were heavy nods to the oppression of people of colour but it was done intelligently and from a somewhat unique angle. Plus, the film was well written, well acted and paced perfectly. So despite the trailer for 'War for the Planet of the Apes' looking like a grotesquely obvious allegory for the upcoming race-war, I figured I might be wrong. I hated the prospect of Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' and the film quickly became a favourite of 2017 for me. It turns out I was right all along. The film stinks of social justice and white privilege. The overwhelmingly white human race are portrayed as a wholly irredeemable group of oppressive savages. Meanwhile the Apes are the oppressed. The unfairly vilified. The misunderstood. The empathetic and admirable. The unsubtle links to today's cultural environment wouldn't have been any more obvious if scene's were dressed in 'Ape Lives Matter' banners or Antifa masks.As far as the film itself, it's about the least layered piece I may ever have seen. There's no subtext, no intelligent subplots. Apes are good, (white) humans are bad. I really can't expand any further on this storytelling mechanic. It is what it is, albeit with lots of CGI. I've ran out of energy to finish reviewing this disappointment. Why the IMDb rating is so high can only reflect either a declining level of acceptable standards or the production company purchasing IMDb accounts. I have seen far more poor reviews than positive and cannot accept people interested in good film would be so complimentary of this huge pile of visual faeces. 2/10","10/10"

"adamhatfield","30 January 2024","I know what you're thinking, Jason Statham was awesome and wrath of man and I bet this is going to be a great movie from the premise that I saw from the preview. But you were wrong. This movie was written by all the rejects that weren't on strike apparently and I don't know how they wrote some of these lines and then said "" That's good, let's go to print. "". This could have been so cool. The best thing in this whole movie was the FBI partner of the garbage female lead. The cat from the Hunger Games did an okay job of making sure that you didn't like him so he probably wasn't bad either in hindsight. Everyone leaving the theater we were in was like WTF did we just watch. The ending conflict at the compound with all of the secret service agents not protesting the massive amount of comical contract killers in proximity to President was just lazy.","3/10"
"adamjohnfuller","17 August 2017","This film is actually very good. I don't get all the hate. I understand those who dislike the anti-white/anti-Christian themes that are apparently there. I myself am a center-right white Christian and didn't see them except in one scene. They aren't as heavy-handed as the other reviewers are trying to make them out to be. From a storytelling standpoint, this film is fantastic. Efficient, eloquent, and kinetic, the story's pace is it's only weakness, more than made up for by the brilliant content and scenework. The combat scenes are the most epic thing since The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and are made only more powerful because they are rare, only to be found at the very first scene and the last few scenes. However, every scene in this film is filled with conflict, the narrative drive of this film never misses a beat, even if not every scene is about a big battle. There is not a single expositional scene in the film save one, and that scene still moves the story forward, so technically it's not an expositional scene. From a technical standpoint, the film is brilliant, Every shot is nothing more than pure art, the CGI is the best I've ever seen, the set pieces are breathtaking, and the musical score, while subtle, does nothing but help the story feel tangible and authentic. The acting is phenomenal, particularly the performances of Harrelson and Serkis. The morally complex layout of the story is halfway to perfection, the haunting hallucinations of Koba represent Caesar's own mental dilemmas and his fear of becoming that which he swore he would never become. Although the film does fall short in being overly simple from a moral standpoint (ape = good, human = bad, almost without exception) it still does a fascinating job on showing the complex nature of Caesar's Moral Character. As this review clearly demonstrates, the film is very good.My real critique is not of the film, but the other reviewers here on IMDb, all of the 2-star and 1-star reviews are completely misleading and just plain disrespectful to the filmmakers involved on this project.These absurdly low reviews are meant for films like The Room or The Emoji Movie, if a film is just plain awful in every sense of the word, then it deserves a low rating. Not just whether you liked the movie or not. I humbly ask my fellow reviewers to put their personal feelings toward a film aside and just judge a movie based on its storytelling and technical qualities.Matt Reeves, Mark Bomback, Andy Serkis, and everyone else who was involved in some way in the film, I apologize for the total and absolute disrespect you are receiving for this film on IMDb, not that you care, being successful and all. But still, it troubles me that professional filmmakers and actors and animators can cook up something this good and have it be completely rejected by a snobby and overly emotional group of ""reviewers"".","9/10"
"adamjohns-42575","16 January 2024","Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny (5) (2023) -I had to wonder how many people left the cinema after seeing this film and said ""Bring back Shia LaBeouf"", because at least his character of Henry Jones Junior, Junior (Mutt) had been established in the previous film, 'Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull' (2008) and had some sort of appeal in his role.And actually, as someone who is not a fan of Phoebe Waller-Bridge and despite the fact that I had been warned about her role of Wombat/Helena I went in to watching this film with an open mind about it and I was coping with her being the one to dig Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) out of his funk,
but then she started to become too much during a tuk-tuk chase. She played things too cocky, more than a bit hammy and like an obstreperous child. I felt that Phoebe was just wholly inappropriate in so many ways and that 'Flavour of the month' syndrome had struck again. I could think of 100 actors that would have played the part better.What if it had been Mutt reprised? It wouldn't even have to be Shia, as long as it was his character, it was ten or more years later after all. But would I have thought it more correct? Probably.Or maybe Ke Huy Quan as Short Round could have reunited with Indy from his role in 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom' (1984)? Although it would have been gimmicky, at least his character fit the brief of a money obsessed rogue from Jones' past, that Phoebe tried and failed to be.Harrison did what he could in the title role, but that was far less than he used to, which was to be expected. However, I had to consider if he had just made this one to show that it really was the last time for him to play the character.His CGI'd version in the initial flashback scene wasn't wholly convincing either, especially when he moved in any way at all. I expected better from ILM (Industrial, Light @ Magic).During this scene I also felt that it was quite darkly filmed, which made it hard to see the action on the Nazi train.I have always liked it when Indiana has been fighting the Nazi's, but it was a stretch for them to still be the enemy in the late 60's, making it a bit like a 'Captain America' and 'Red Skull' storyline.In general it was a slow start to find out what was actually going on, what the treasure would be and what it might do, but I did like the slightly different tack it took due to Indiana being older so that the story had to be slowed a bit too. Although it was clear that they weren't killing and fighting as much and in such an obvious pausing way to avoid shooting the lead character straight away. There were numerous times where he/she/they should have all been defeated easily.I felt that if this film had been released as the second, third or even fourth instalment of the franchise, but in the 1980's when Harrison was still young enough to do his own stunts and BE the main character it might not have been such a disappointing episode and it did seem episodic too as if it could have been broken up in to a serial, which might have worked better for this particular story, likely with, a less high expectation for it as a result.If it had been filmed back then though, Wombat wouldn't have needed to be the action hero element and things might have flowed more like the typical Jones film. I'm not saying that she had to be a damsel in distress like Kate Capshaw's Willie character in 'Temple', because I loved Marion's (Karen Allen) involvement in more of the action in 'Crystal Skulls', but Wombat had clearly been created to take the slack from Harry, with Phoebe just wrongly cast to do that.The later time setting seemed to diminish the colour and excitement of the others that had gone before too. Things had moved on a bit too far for it to seem so nostalgic and historic. There wasn't the charm of the less advanced technology and so on.I did like the inclusion of an underwater element as something different to what we've seen before however and I didn't mind the time travel thing, although the way that it was done was a tad farcical. There were many other ways that a legend like Indiana Jones could have travelled in time without it being such a comic book delivery.I did think that it might have been better if they'd let the good Doctor stay in old Syracuse, as a way of wrapping up the series, especially as the epilogue with Marion was a bit naff.And I wasn't even sure that it needed the wonderful John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, although his presence didn't take anything away from the film, it didn't add much either.I will watch it again and it might grow on me and ultimately I didn't hate it, but they could definitely have done better, especially as it was surely the send off of the fantastic character we've all come to know and love.I don't think that it will ever rank that highly though and as I write more film reviews it will probably be one that I use as an example of what not to do, however if taken separately from the franchise and just considered on its own merit, it really had quite a good story and nobody performed sooo badly that it should be hated.648.07/1000.","7/10"
"adamjohns-42575","23 May 2021","A perfectly satisfactory way to end an enjoyable trilogy. It would have been easy to go all guns blazing and have a massive war between Humans and Apes worldwide with huge explosions and ridiculous death tolls on either side, but they cleverly kept it all very focused in San Francisco where the story originated and we are still unclear how the rest of the world faired against the ""Simian Flu"".The characters are all well formed having largely been in the series from the beginning and I loved to see Maurice's role grow. I also adored the addition of Bad Ape, a great performance by Steve Zahn and not what I was expecting from him at all.The CGI in this one has already vastly improved since the first of the trilogy and the apes are almost completely realistic.I'm sure there are people out there who have never seen or even heard of the original 'Planet Of The Apes' films or even the Mark Wahlberg version, so many will be surprised by the ending, but I think the majority of us all knew how it would go down for the most part. I would still like to know how Lady Liberty ends up covered in sand on a beach, but it's not something I will lose sleep over.Although I can't stand Charlton, I am tempted to try and watch the original films all the way through and I would certainly like to read the book, because these three films have sparked my interest in the larger ape world.","8/10"
"adamlennard","21 February 2023","I really did enjoy this film, mainly due to some very good acting and a fun story and a pretty good villain. In terms of the MCU this will probably rank somewhere in the middle which shows just how good the MCU can be. Paul Rudd is perfect as Antman as usual but I personally really enjoyed Michael Douglas performance. Will it win any awards? Probably not, did it keep me entertained? Absolutely and at the end of the day I'm a firm believer movies are about having fun and enjoying yourself and this quite simply is a lot of fun. As mentioned before one big strength is the films villain one area the MCU struggles is it's bad guys and I'm pleased to say Kang is one of the better ones with an interesting motive the fact Antman himself questions if defeating Kang was the right things is an unique wrinkle.","2/10"

"adamshl","24 November 2012","This film is so beautiful to see, and the director's production so enthralling, that it rather grieves me to criticize the work, but that I'm compelled to do.The problem with this is that the adult Pi's interpretation of his adventures both confuses and undermines the narrative. He (and writer) are so committed to making this interpretation as vague and general as possible that it leaves one in limbo.Likewise such things as the ""canivorous island"" sequence dips into the fantasy idiom, which conflicts with its realistic content, making for muddled genre.Finally, in an effort to be inclusive regarding Pi's religious background, the writer chose to specify particular religions, thereby muddling the narrative's purity. It would have been better to dramatize the spirituality rather than specify it by naming names. This later limits the story's universality and further complicates the narrative's purpose.By keeping things as vague as possible, I'm sure many viewers think there's something deep here . . . something mystical and of a high plane. Actually I see it as a smoke screen for appearance sake and special effect.Still, the director's production is at such a high technical level that the film must be correctly be called ""good.""","8/10"
"adamsmith-51004","26 March 2023","Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumanis is a good film and a good start to the MCU's Phase 5. Would rate it either a 7/10 possibly 6/10 due to some questionable choices in pacing, comedy and it's Villain. By no means was Kang Terrible, as Jonathan Majors performance as him was one of the highlights of the film, he is a great actor and will be interesting to see more of him. ""He who remains"" wasn't a good showing. But the film somewhat has inconsistent tonal shifts and pacing of the movie from being somewhat slow at the start, to fast in the middle and rushed high octane towards the end. Also the lack of supporting characters mostly Janet, hurts this movie.The comedy didn't hit for me asides from a few jokes directed at a specific character but some of the dialogue and interactions between characters felt forced. The new characters felt like I've seen them before due to the marvel formula, asides from Jentorra, but even she is debatable I liked her character/actress and Cassie as she has potential to grow but she was annoying at times in the movie but as a ""Young Avenger"" the potential is there.The CGI and VFX Effects weren't as Laughable or down right terrible as people had described as any Marvel movie they were good in some scenes yes they weren't the best with a certain character the element of realism had already gone out the window. Some scenery and environments whilst in the quantum realm looked highly detailed and immersive. The overall set pieces/ships did provide a Star Wars vibe, which isn't a bad thing.This film yet again proves that knowledge of the TV shows is starting to be required just like Dr Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness having watched WandaVision helped my understanding of the topics with Ant Man 3 watching Loki does better the overall viewer experience but enough explanation is provided in the film to make it watchable for newcomers even still there is a reliance on the viewer having watched or is caught up with Loki which knocks off a point.Overall, Its a good watch with a friend or someone who likes the MCU's Ant-Man and its movies as this lays the foundation of the Big Bad to be Kang and his plans to conqure. It has some emotional heartfelt moments, engaging performances, high stakes and seemingly lasting consequences it's still fresh so my opinion may change but its between a 6 or 7 out of 10.","3/10"
"adeckofcards","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","1/10"
"adityabagri-67458","2 June 2023","""Across the Spider-Verse"" introduces an extraordinary ensemble of characters that truly make the film shine. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is undeniably the best CBM of 2023, its not even close(taste of all mid af cbms like gotg3,antman3 and shazam 2 is washed away) thanks to its exceptional characters, a compelling storyline, emotional depth, and a cliffhanger that leaves us hungry for more. Spider-Punk, with his rebellious spirit and unique punk-inspired appearance, brings a fresh and exciting energy to the story. Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of India. His presence not only expands the Spider-Verse but also adds depth to the story as what canon is what is supposed to happen and what is not in the spiderverse. Ben Rileytake on the Spider-Man mythology. Spider-Gwen to impress with her dynamic and empowering portrayal. Her qrelatable vulnerabilities, and growth as a hero make her an incredibly likable and compelling character and her journey is quiet great in the movie. Of course, the heart of the story remains with Miles Morales, whose growth as a hero continues to impress. Miles' journey of self-discovery, responsibility, and finding his own voice within the Spider-Verse is masterfully portrayed. His relatability, vulnerability, and undeniable charm make him a character that audiences genuinely care about and root for. Peter B. Parker in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" not only shines as a hero but also as a great husband, mentor, and father figure. His portrayal as a loving and supportive husband to Mary Jane Watson, and as a caring mentor and father figure to Mayday Parker, is truly commendable. Together, these characters form a rich tapestry that sparks genuine emotional investment from viewers. Their individual arcs and interactions create a dynamic ensemble that balances moments of humor, heart, and intense action. The chemistry among the characters is palpable, enhancing the storytelling and making the Spider-Verse feel alive and vibrant.Furthermore, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" excels in delivering a gripping and well-crafted storyline. The narrative takes viewers on an exhilarating journey through multiple dimensions, filled with unexpected challenges and confrontations with an array of villains. The story seamlessly weaves together themes of self-discovery, responsibility, and the importance of family, creating a tapestry of depth and emotion. The film strikes a perfect balance between thrilling action sequences and poignant character-driven moments, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish.Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cliffhanger that leaves us eagerly anticipating the next installment. It leaves us with burning questions, heightened anticipation, and an insatiable desire to witness what comes next in this intricate web of storytelling.","10/10"

You know the ones I'm talking about. They involve time travel.
Yup, when you have no idea how to fix the writing mess you've made, reach into your bag of hacks and pull out time travel.
So too have the writers of the latest Marvel film.
Worse yet, it's a mirror image of the previous Marvel Avengers film. Only this time, we have the heroes digging around in the past tracking down all the stones (as opposed to Thanos doing it) and a giant pointless CGI fight at the end (just like the last time around.)I couldn't figure out how the film was 3 hours long, until they started getting the stones, each section is played out seemingly just to pad the runtime. When the Hulk puts on the Iron-Man created infinity glove and snaps his fingers to bring everyone back, all the returned folks take it quite well, just a quip and a node of ""oh, we were dead, and now we're back? That's fine.""This film glosses over so many more interesting aspects of the plot in a rush to get to the CGI fest that is the end.Sure, the film will make billions from all the fans (and let's face it, this is for the fans only) but it doesn't deserve to.

"AdrenalinDragon","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10","5/10"

"adrri0n","27 February 2023","It was good. It's not trying too hard to be any more than it needs to be. It's an introductory film to Phase 5. Honestly, this movie got bombed with bad reviews of people who forget this movie is a Marvel movie. It's not gonna be a cinematic masterpiece. I was entertained, so I liked it. It wasn't special and there are certainly better Marvel movies. But it's a good introduction to what is coming up next. This movie did what it needed to do, get us excited for Phase 5. Remember, people who didn't like this film are still gonna come back and watch every upcoming Marvel film from Phase 5 and beyond. While it does have a predictable and tame story, 90% of movies are predictable anyway. We don't watch movies for the ending, we watch them for what leads up to it. It's an enjoyable superhero film that people will come back to appreciate if Phase 5 gets it right.","1/10"
"adykotidou","21 August 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has absolutely stunning visuals (as expected), incredible and natural voice acting, lovable characters with great character development, amazing music and much more.Since the first movie was so breathtaking, this sequel had a lot to live up to. However, it definitely met or even surpassed my expectations. In my opinion, Spider-Verse 2 is undoubtedly a worthy successor to the first film. In fact, I believe that it's one of the best animated movies of 2023 - if not of all time.Oh and also, it's full of little hidden details and Easter eggs! I can't wait to watch it again and try to Spot more of them (pun intended).Everyone who worked on this film did an outstanding job and deserves more praise. Just incredible. No need to say more.","10/10"
"afeey","29 June 2023","After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales (Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.","10/10"
"afenixmusic","28 December 2020","I just watched it and this was the most regressive that Dragon Ball has ever been.
They dumbed down all of the characters so much it's just heartbreaking.
Goku just wants to get stronger. Vegeta just wants to get it over with. Piccolo is just there to teach them one basic move. Frieza is there just because. And the saddest part is Broly and Paragus - they've completely been stripped of any motivation behind their actions and just been deduced to ""we're just here for the revenge hurr durr"" plot.
In the 1993 movie Paragus has come up with this elaborate revenge plan, to trick Vegeta into rebuilding the Saiyan race. He has clear motivations, a unique twist to his actions and interesting dialogue which brings a lot of weight to his character. Now the motivations are sort-of the same, but the way he achieves his plans is just pathetic and disrespectful to the legacy of the character to say the least. His arch ends so abruptly that you just stop caring for him and that is very sad.
Broly as well, has been deduced from an all-out menacing galaxy destroying killing machine to a vegetable who blindly follows wherever you point your finger at. You can argue that his arch of him growing up helps to flesh out his character, but I'm sorry - playing with fluffy dogs is not how you build a villain. The original Broly had true-felt hatred sown deep inside of him and his every hit blown towards the main characters carried that hatred. Now, it's as I mentioned - ""Imma hit this guy because I'm told to"".
The animations are basically the same quality as in the 1993 film, and I'd like to stress this - it came out 25 years before this 'remake'. Albeit in this film they're in slightly higher frame rate. But the overall quality of animations is as expected from a modern animated film and are still what I'd consider as average.
The character design also suffered a downgrade. Paragus, from a military leader was deduced to a simple servant. And Broly - his unique world-bending color-shifting attacks which actually felt like they might blow up the entire world with a touch of a finger - are no longer there. The green aura remains, but it just feels so darn basic.
No feeling of hopelessness, no menacing aura, no feeling of unity - there are simply no stakes to make this story feel impactful.
Do yourself a favor, skip this movie and watch the original ""Dragon Ball Z Movie: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.","10/10"
"AfricanBro","20 January 2024","The opening title sequence sets an intense and epic vibe, almost like a dark psychological thriller. This is an instant classic, instant! It's like if John Wick was the equalizer, but it's Jason Statham, who happens to have a fascination with bees and bee analogies. While I recently haven't watched Statham's best movies, this one compelled me to label it as some of his best work yet. But that's probably the adrenaline speaking. The fight scenes were both cool and intimidating, often laced with moments of humor as Statham toyed with his adversaries.The story was just okay, nothing spectacular even though the big bad was essentially the biggest big-bad; but to be honest the story's just a bonus, it's like a favor from the writers because the whole movie is really just Jason Statham engaging in relentless action, whooping butt. I think this is the first action movie of this sort I've enjoyed this much since the first two equalizer films with Denzel Washington.Now, my primary gripe lies in the lack of truly formidable antagonists-except for the Afrikaans dude, most of the villains felt rather lackluster in posing a challenge to Mr. Cray. A touch of additional villainous depth could have heightened the movie's tension. Bad guys could've been more bad ass. I always knew Mr cray was gonna win the next fight, it never felt like the stakes were high.Jason Statham undoubtedly shines as one of the finest action stars, showcasing his prowess in this film. Fifth movie in a year. I love how even though there's a few funny bits, they're not inherently comical; the main character has serious, no-nonsense demeanor, maintaining a dark and brutal persona throughout. The film wisely refrains from diluting this intensity with unnecessary jokes or lightheartedness. While not flawless-some minor issues with dialogue and acting in non-action segments-I highly recommend if you're an action fan. But even if you're not, because my sister had a blast with this too.Also there are no credit scenes, I googled but a couple websites seem to have it mixed up with Aquaman credit scene.","8/10"
"AGood","4 May 2018","This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment.The film was literally;Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen. But parents will be bored. A movie needs to be more than just this.","2/10"
"aharmas","2 December 2012","We live in an era of cinema where it's very difficult to feel fulfilled with contemporary movies. There is some dissatisfaction about how the emphasis is on special effects and more than often the script is weak in comparison. Also, some people associate only serious themes with quality, and we can't help but wonder why we seem to place so much weight on period/costume movies while evaluating films. Thankfully we have people like Ang Lee who will not put a film together if the elements don't fit. With the exception of the ""Hulk"" which looks right and has a good story, yet it didn't quite match his other accomplishments, and he has tried just about every genre in cinema.Here he gives us what could be his absolute masterpiece, ""The Life of Pi"" a film that works in so many levels: it's entertaining, wondrous, a metaphor for faith and the power of life, for just about every feeling we can think of or feel. It is so powerful that every single frame and line in it has a purpose and grabs our attention in a gentle and yet, sure way. Once the film begins, you can't look away or engage in any other thoughts, and all sorts of annoying technology (other than the one in the screen) is forgotten. As a member of the audience, you want this superb piece of imagery and storytelling to continue charming you, teaching you, getting inside your head, heart and soul.Pi tells his amazing survival story to another man, a writer I believe, and the beginning of the film provides the background of a young man who believes in spirituality and searches for answers from early. Later on, as the story takes him across the world, his beliefs and faith will be tested in several incredible ways. Pi is from India, and he has a connection to living beings and other spiritual entities. His family doesn't quite understand his hunger, but his mothers tells the others to allow to pursue what he feels is right.As they decide to move to Canada, tragedy strikes their ship, and Pi finds himself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with a few animals that managed to escape from the cargo holds. His odyssey, with Mr. Lee's amazing control of every possible film element, from one of the most sensational pieces of editing, some magical cinematography, sound effects, and a lovely music score, we learn, as he does that there are a few miracles out there, and most of the times, encountering them is a test of the soul.Most of the interaction is between him and Richard Parker, a Bengali tiger that has as much will to live as Pi does. Lee has filmed some unbelievable scenes, and I am still in awe about the way he did accomplish this. It's either the wonders of great editing, some quite sensational computer graphic imagery, or just plain terrific direction by Lee.Pi and Parker's main goal is to survive, and they start by outsmarting each other and proving their worth, claiming territoriality, and giving us some thrilling and at times, very funny and scary exchanges. Eventually, as the story reaches its last sections, we see another type of link develop, and a film that is certainly qualifying as a wonderful movie from its beginning has now soared into greatness. The audience must be ready to gasp, and choke as powerful expressions, sometimes wordless acting force us into looking into our own emotions. Tears will inevitable roll out as you witness beauty rarely shown in movies. ""Pi"" is surely one of the best films ever made, an instant classic, and a reflection into humanity, those entities we choose to guide us through our human trek in this world. Whether or not you believe its message, can relate to its ideas or just enjoy its execution is entirely up to you. It does offer an interesting choice at it concludes. You decide. Either way, it will move you.","9/10"
"aharmas","21 July 2017","The conclusion to the latest version of one of the ""Planet of the Apes"" proves to be a superb production, full of both action and heart. With a solid screenplay that dedicates equal time to pensive quiet moments and action that moves the story to its emotional conclusion, we are given what is arguably the masterpiece of the year.Caesar is now in the middle of a conflict that will decide the fate of his followers. He still considers murder an abominable act and preaches for peaceful solutions. Let us live in peace and everything should be fine. Well, not everything is going the way he wants. His family is murdered by an unstable and vengeful colonel who wants to exterminate the apes and carryout his plans for revenge.Caesar's tragedy propels him to find the colonel and seek justice. There is much happening during his trip, and we are witnesses to the effects of the apes' evolution on their human counterparts. Whoever hasn't been killed by the virus is now regressing into different types of humanoids. It's affecting their speech and mental capacities. This becomes an essential plot development that explains what is going on with the colonel.Humans are for the most part portrayed as cruel assassins, with a collective desire to destroy life. The scenes in the base recall concentration camp mentality, and the final battles are portrayed in such a way that we know nothing good will come out of it. Nature is beginning to settle the conflict, and it might end up playing an important part in the film's climax.Much of the success is Andy Serkis' amazing turn as Caesar. He keeps getting better and better, giving us access to the turmoil and the variety of feelings he experiences throughout the film. Intelligence, grief, anger, surprise are clearly shown, and we soon forget that we CGI is even a part of the equation.The film has an epic film, with gorgeous vistas shown in the different parts of the journey. Emotions are highlighted by the use of light and how the camera focuses on everything, the faces, and the background. It's a beautiful way to tell a story, and as you will have experienced by the film's conclusion, and to reach an audience by touching their hearts.","5/10"
"ahmadmobeenqazi","31 May 2023","I was fortune enough to attend the premiere here in Singapore. A non-spoiler review follows:Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does more than just swing into action; it weaves a narrative tapestry with passion, dedication, and love. The creators of this epic journey have clearly poured their heart and soul into every frame, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.The animation is a tour de force, seamlessly blending diverse art styles that bring the Spider-Verse to life in a way that feels vibrant and fresh. Each scene is a feast for the eyes, painting the screen with a burst of colors and imaginative designs that will leave you breathless.Equally commendable is the strength of the narrative that effortlessly connects with the audience. The story doesn't just unfold; it entangles you in its web, ensuring that you are invested in every dramatic interaction, every thrilling fight sequence, and every emotional climax.Character development is another highlight of the film. The growth our beloved characters undergo adds layers of depth to the story, making their journeys all the more engaging. Their interactions, whether action-packed or heartwarming, are captivating and contribute greatly to the film's overall quality.The score and soundtrack are also nothing short of fire, underscoring every moment with tunes that not only set the mood but also elevate the story to new heights.However, if I absolutely have to nitpick, there are a few moments when it seems to pull on the heartstrings a tad excessively. This slight overindulgence in sentimentality is a small nitpick in an otherwise excellent film.The way the Spider-Verse is portrayed, introduced, and expanded feels effortless and organic. You get a sense of a larger universe out there, waiting to be explored, which adds to the anticipation for the next part in this thrilling saga.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning and an emotionally gripping adventure. I, for one, can't wait to see where this journey takes us next.","10/10"

And what about that one ape they found who can speak very well just by listening to humans?

"ahmetkozan","25 April 2019","After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10","10/10"
"ahoffyman","18 January 2019","To start I'd like to clarify I have been a dbz fan since I was 7 years old when I discovered DBZ on toonami in 2000. Since then I have seen DB, DBZ,GT, Super, every movie and special, and read the manga. I was an avid collector of dozens of action figures and toys as a kid and have bought tons of DB merchandise over the years. I became a black belt in Taekwondo, and made dozens of friends through DB, many of whom I'm friends with to this day. I played through all the game boy games many times and decorated my entire room in Orange and blue, with a DBZ mural above my DB clock on the wall. I had the promotional cardboard stand ups for both legend of Goku games in my room and........You get the picture. I am thoroughly familiar with and enjoy DB comedy and style.
Now I say all that to clarify that I am indeed a lifelong DB fan as it has helped shaped who I am today.
With all that said I need to mention some gripes with this movie that many of the fans have overlooked and are overhyping(looking at these other reviews).
This will contain plot spoilers on the movie, but nothing too specific. This is an honest review coming from a fan who is also a film buff, and is not content with just blindly screaming ""This is the greatest movie ever made"", as some have stated(please).I will start with what this movie did well.This movie is Based on DragonballZ, obviously. A series that earned its popularity largely on the quality of its action sequences. It is therefore quite ironic that this movie shines brightest during its first half. During this time we are told the story of the origin of the Saiyans draft into the Frieza force; a new(far more realistic and superior) origin story for Paragus and his powerful son, Broly; Our first on-screen introduction to Gine and her family relationship with Bardock and sons; and a nice nod to the older fans regarding The Father of Goku special. Everything done before the flash-forward to present day is emaculate. Story, animation, cinematography, characters, motivation; everything was phenomenal.
Once the timeskip happens, however; things begin to sour. We are once again greeted with the super comedic, one-dimensional parodies of Goku and Vegeta, as well as all the other characters that have become jokes thanks to their writing in DBS. (Think of egghead style krillin vs. DBZ krillin artstyle)Apparently Bulma has been collecting the dragon balls to wish herself 5 years younger. Why not even younger than that? Well she doesn't want people thinking she got plastic surgery. And why does Frieza want the Dragonballs? I can tell you it's not for immorality. Any guesses?.................. Wrong. He wants to increase his height by 5 cms. Why not taller? Well he wants people to think he's still growing. Yeah, it's dumb. And the dialogie for everything beyond this point is just rather cringey.Ever wanted to be treated to Vegeta yelling at Goku for the obsurdity of the fusion dance. Watch him pull an awkward ""dance move"" while yelling at him in this masterpiece. In fact expect Vegeta to do few things out of character in this.You get the point on the cringe. Let's move on.CGI is utilized yet again in this movie, sometimes for the best, othertimes its so off that it takes you out of the immersive experience. It's best when used on landscapes and power beams but it's simply distracting and awkward on characters. Instead of an actual score for the music, the Japanese have decided for a narrator to just be chanting the name of the last person to power up. More cringe. People were actually laughing out loud at this.POV shots during fight scenes were utilized rather well, giving you a sense of the flight and battle while not taking up too much time during what turned out to be the longest fight in DB movie history.The choreography was pretty decent for what you could see when the cinematographers didn't insist on using the ""shake effect"", making it harder to follow what was already a hard to follow fight. I was quite perturbed by this in fact, as well as many shots of fists flying followed by shots a closeup impact on someone's face(i.e. indicating lazy animation). For all intents and purposes I think they have run out of ideas on making a fight more epic than Goku vs Jiren and have opted to just throw any and all animation styles at you. It comes across as doing too much and the obsurdity of it all took me out of it yet again. In fact during the GogetavBroly fight, they seem too break into some pseudo alter dimension, as if this now gives them an excuse to use even crazier animation.In fact, the introduction and transformation into Gogeta is completely out of the blue, rushed, and lazily foreshadowed(if you can call it that). And it's at this point of the movie you start to realize that it's the fourth or fifth time the creators have added in something as almost a wink to the audience(not referring to gogeta).The writers actually gave us a significant amount of time learning about Broly as a person. It was a very good inclusion and I greatly enjoyed what they did with this incarnation, but when your two main characters are arguably the worst parts of the movie it's tough to call it the Greatest of all time. Anyway, go see it for yourself, whether you agree with me or think it should be #1 on Imdb I'm sure you will have a decent time regardless.","10/10"
"aikenkatie","22 May 2018","Not that great- WAY too long, too unengaging and too many plot holes-just too much period. I'm notorious for crying in movies;didn't even sniffle, and there were many ""deaths"" of my fav characters. ""Poignant"" scenes were all flat, I didn't buy into any of them at all. Always a bad sign when I'm checking my watch and realizing I still have to sit there for 45 more minutes- didn't even stay for the bonus at the end. Yawn! Knew I waited for a reason, and I'm sorry I saw this- the individual movies are light years better- would still pay to see Black Panther/ Captain America/ Wonder Woman again, and I've seen them multiple times already.

In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","10/10"

And here it elevates the emotions of every MCU fans that too right from the stone.I always wanted to brag/say about Endgame but that will end up with too many spoilers. So the plot remains unrevealed.The movie has an ensemble cast feat. all the ones you've known and with the outnumbered super heroes teams up to defeat Thanos, one of the most powerful villain of MCU. He stands out tall in this one too. All superheroes has their own spaces, imprinting themselves in everyone's mind. Endgame portrays the emotions and personal stories of the superheroes and was really touching.Even though Endgame is Visual Masterpiece but rides through the emotions whole throughout but also will make you laugh. Thor, Antman, Hulk and Rocket leads the laughter squad. Captain America was not my fav. hero, but after this he has a special spot in my heart. Iron Man, he was brilliant. All the superheroes will grab a special place in your heart for sure.Russo brothers did a wonderful job in terms of writing and in directing. Endgame is visual treat to the eyes and the finale battle was also well convincing. Technical aspects were outstanding in terms of Camera, Score, CGI, Editing, Art, etc.It's a long 181 minutes movie but you will not take your eyes even for one second.A must watch in Theaters especially in IMAX. a MASTERPIECEI will go out with 10 on 10","10/10"
"Akaanksh","27 April 2019","Avengers Endgame Review
Score - 10/10
Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story.
The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise.
Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise.
The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of.
PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll.","7/10"
"akcenat","31 January 2024","This 2024 action thriller aims high but fails to deliver. While Jason Statham is reliably gritty as ex-operative Adam Clay turned beekeeper, seeking vengeance for his neighbour's suicide, the silly script undermines any gravitas. Overwrought bee metaphors like ""time to smoke out the hornets"" make the premise absurd. Most supporting actors flounder, particularly the miscast female FBI agent (Emmy Raver-Lampman), who is, by the way, a terrible actress. The first half builds narrative momentum around Clay's crusade against predatory scammers, but the stakes needed raising, not contradicting. Once Clay infiltrates the corporation behind the phone schemes, the film descends into generic action movie tropes we've seen done better. Statham's action sequences still pack a punch but can't save the nonsensical plot. Even at a brisk 105 minutes, The Beekeeper starts strongly before losing its narrative sting. This would-be franchise-launcher leaves a bad taste. Not recommended.Rating: 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.","5/10"
"akcenat","6 December 2023","Indiana Jones returns in ""Dial of Destiny,"" and while it's a nostalgic thrill to see Harrison Ford back in the fedora, the film feels stuck in the past. It's long, repetitive, and lacks the spark of its predecessors. The action sequences, though plentiful, are uninspired, the CGI occasionally jarring. While new faces like Phoebe Waller-Bridge inject fresh energy, the story itself feels derivative. Ultimately, ""Dial of Destiny"" is a decent throwback for die-hard fans, but it's more of a slow walk down memory lane than a thrilling new adventure.I'm a bit disappointed...Rating: 6.75 out of 10.","6/10"
"akkred","17 July 2017","Visuals are absolutely stunning. Period. I can't write too much about it because the movie looks great!Too bad that the story is stunningly stupid, though. I am a big fan of the first two parts of this sequel and I had high expectations against the final episode as well.Without going into all the details you will face: - Ceasar who's unable to understand the concept of war - a little girl who became instant friends of the apes, no matter that she was probably raised to hate/fear the apes and the monkeys just killed his father 5 minutes ago - a supposedly high security military camp where this girl could just walk in without anybody seeing her - a supposedly high security military camp which has unguarded, not exploded pipelines underneath where anybody can simply walk in - a supposedly high security military camp with ground thick as 10in so anybody can just dig up from underneath - evil Colonel building a completely useless wall - Jar Jar Binks of the apes. Thats on its own deserves a face punch! - a train wagon full of gasoline capable to destroy the entire military base. - Ridiculous distances traveled in minutes (from sunny, probably warm beach to snowstorm) - Ceasar got an arrow shot in the final battle. Then he travels with his tribe thru deserts and lands which should take at least a year. Once they arrived to a lake they will call ""home"", Ceasar dies from the bleeding arrow shot... stupid! That would have killed him in days if not hours.and so on, and so on.These ""little"" things completely ruined the movie for me and I only stayed because my girlfriend refused to walk out. At the end she admitted that it was a mistake.","3/10"

No real story.Nothing compelling or even that interesting.Hollywood please can we just take a little more time and effort to actually write something worth watching?10 stars for the overworked and underpaid CGI teams.4 stars for the acting (they really tried with what they were given)1 star for the story if you can call it that.Overall 3 stars.If you want some bland entertainment and a forgettable night out feel free to watch it. Hopefully you'll enjoy some good company and some popcorn while you yawn and look at your watch.Otherwise just wait a few weeks till it comes out on Disney plus.Or just read the synopsis.

"akseliiikonen","1 June 2023","I had decently big expectations for this one, especially for a spider man movie, but rarely any of them were filled.I don't know how people find this movie that great, i just find it an ok movie with an ok plot. I definitely saw a lot of potential, but the plot was too overwhelming with so many things in the background. Main thing that i didn't like was the lack of action. I went to watch this movie to see a great plot, and a ton of action, but that certainly didn't happen.The first 40 minutes of the movie covers just the main characters which i found pretty boring. Rest of the movie was just 20 things happening at the same time. I felt like falling asleep halfway through, but luckilt at least there was some action.Definitely an ""Avengers: infinity war"" try, but lacks action. 7/10 at most.","10/10"
"akshatmahajan","16 October 2020","War for the Planet of the Apes is a great movie. There are a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Everything serves the characters and story. This movie has death, suffering, plight, heroism and empathy. The effects are astonishing..Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to, ""give me action"" needs. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films.The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action. Beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters. This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.Overall, you should watch it for yourself and shouldn't believe in negative reviews. Those who gave negative reviews to this movie are those who wanted only fight/ action scenes and those who don't have knowledge of pure cinema.","1/10"

"aleksovski92","17 January 2024","Okay, let's get this out the hive right away: The Beekeeper didn't sting me the way I hoped. Jason Statham as a vengeance-fueled ex-spy? That's usually my honey pot. But this particular batch left me feeling a bit... sticky.First off, the visuals. The cinematography felt uninspired, lacking the crispness and dynamism that could have elevated the action sequences. And while the explosions delivered a certain boom, they lacked the visceral punch that truly immerses you in the scene.Speaking of Statham, he's the undeniable highlight. Dude throws punches with raw intensity, and his signature grit shines through every scene. But even Statham can't fully salvage the plot. The twists were predictable, and the supporting cast's motivations felt underdeveloped, leaving them mostly as one-dimensional action fodder.The saving grace, however, is the action itself. Statham commits to every fight, delivering brutal choreography that's undeniably entertaining, even if the CGI occasionally falters. It's like they poured all their budget into Statham's stunt doubles and said, ""Meh, the rest can be pixelated bees, who cares?""So, should you check out The Beekeeper? Well, if you're a die-hard Statham fan and crave mindless action, then maybe. Just set your expectations for a B-movie experience with predictable twists and underwhelming visuals. Otherwise, you might be better off buzzing over to something else. This hive ain't worth the sting.","5/10"
"alekspredator87","11 May 2023","Although ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" promised to be a bright sequel to the franchise, I was disappointed after watching the film. The ragged narrative and lack of drama that were promised in the trailer made the film a disappointment for me personally. That's the problem of inflated expectations, which appeared to me thanks to a really cool trailer.I'll scold the script first. It seems that the screenwriters could not fully develop the potential of the film and forgot about the relevance of the whole action in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Again and again we see an emphasis on penny intrigues and a purely situational turn of events, which, of course, could work if it were combined with something grandiose. Viewers were promised a large-scale conflict between the new antagonist Kang and Ant-Man and his team. In fact, several new and little-remembered characters with jokes aka ""how many holes does anyone have"" appeared before us, and one of the comic villains turned into a laughing stock at all.One of the main drawbacks of the film is the ragged presentation of the material. The film unsuccessfully veers between drama and trash comedy, which creates an ambiguous impression. Sometimes it seems that the film cannot decide which genre it wants to represent and this reduces the quality of the project, literally dropping it somewhere below the baseboard.But the biggest disappointment for me was the expressionless antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The way it was announced by the creators, the way it was shown in the trailer, absolutely cannot be compared with what happened to be seen in the picture itself. The motivation of the character is poorly worked out, although it is worth paying tribute to the actor Jonathan Majers, who tried, there are no questions to his game, but there are a lot to his hero. The character turned out to be just boring and is forgotten literally five minutes after viewing.The already familiar heroes in the person of Ant, Wasp, Pym family and Scott Lang's daughter were not impressed either. Banal dialogues, movement for the sake of movement, scenario moves do not leave a chance for real drama in this project, although it begins a new chapter of the Cinematic Universe and was announced as a large-scale epic. However, it is worth paying tribute to the visual effects team. The picture is at a height. The quantum world into which the main characters fall is able to surprise the viewer with its scale and all possible colors. The imagination of the creators pleases, showing unusual pictures of a tiny world.In general, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania"" is definitely not the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A weak drama, an ill-conceived script and a passing plot do not allow this film to stand out from other projects. If you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, then this movie is certainly worth watching, but you should be prepared for the fact that after watching it, an unpleasant feeling of disappointment may remain.6 out of 10.","6/10"
"Alenbalz","29 May 2014","Fantastic photography, and a really entertaining storyline that has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The director has added another feather to his cap of great cinematic achievements. Beautiful scenery and vivid colors, makes you marvel at the wonders of nature, some fantastic ocean storm waves, showing just how big and powerful the ocean really is. But let's not forget this is a fictional movie, and like the Superman or The Hulk etc etc, movies, it's very believable and engaging. In a broad sense, it's also a treatise about mans faith and belief in religion and a God, a personal vs an Abstract God, told allegorically; a boy on a life boat with some other survivors, depicted as wild animals, and towards the end of the movie alluded to be humans (and more specifically inhumane humans), all vieing for survival. It's left up to the viewer to choose which story-line they prefer to believe in: and the analogy to which religion/God they prefer to believe in. So if you can come way from a Superman or Batman movie without it challenging your faith and belief in the real world around you, this movie should be approached in the same way, with the added bonus, that you might view your relationship with reality and religion afresh.","9/10"

"alessandro_sp","17 August 2023","As with the first film but upping the ante a notch, this sequel reinstates the choices made before. Sony has made such a genious move. They developed a style on their own, which cannot be plagiarized without backfiring on whoever does it. Bold, successful move. Haven't seen something like this since What dreams may come (1998).And it's not a case of all looks and no substance either. The story backs the visuals, and it wasn't until 15 minutes from the end that I noticed the movie wouldn't wrap in this installment. The pace, story and cinematic choices really draw you into it, so much so that you don't notice time passing by.If I have only one criticism is that in fact pace is so fast that one might miss several references or jokes. Other than that, congratulations on Sony and Marvel for setting new and higher standards.","9/10"

"Alex_Lo","5 February 2021","A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","10/10"
"alexaquarius","11 June 2023","Miles Morales did gave a great show this time in this movie. The way the story line goes is just breathtaking. Multiverse have already given Marvel infinite options to go with , In this movie they have utilized it wisely. As an Indian I am hyped to see Pavitr Prabhakar in this movie. He also spiced things up in the movie. Miguel O'Hara also known as the Spiderman 2099 made lots of impact in the movie. As the movie progressed more and more suspense was revealed which were all goosebumps moments, especially the climax. Earth 42 is going to offer lot more in the next movie and I am so excited to watch it. Love the whole movie , eagerly waiting for spiderman beyond the spider verse. Hope the next movie will be a Blast.","10/10"
"alexcuetodo","4 February 2024","It's so basic trying to link the news with a plot so silly, that it's even funny; but nevertheless, this is a horrid film production. In align with that, it's worth mentioning limited acting, a terrible script and zero cinematographic intentions to make a good movie. Please keep Jason Statham away from the cameras for the upcoming years until he's retired unless he decides to compromise with his job. On the other hand, Jeremy Irons: shame on you for accepting being part of such a stupid story. I guess the writers were trying to create a mediocre copy of Jonh Wick, but without giving it too much thought. Finally, let's not allow that Emmy Raver-Lampman work in a film again, or, is the script to blame for her total unrealistic performance? This film has too many flaws to be depicted in a single review, but it was awful and a complete waste of time.","4/10"

'Finding himself in a new era, approaching retirement, Indy wrestles with fitting into a world that seems to have outgrown him. But as the tentacles of an all-too-familiar evil return in the form of an old rival, Indy must don his hat and pick up his whip once more to make sure an ancient and powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.'
I actually really enjoyed this one. It has its flaws, particularly that third act, but I felt it was a solid send off to Indie. I think it had its moments to shine, and I enjoyed it.The opening to the film is a de-aged Indie fighting the nazis. It actually looks pretty good, and the de-ageing was very solid. I also felt like it felt like the original trilogy, and I was hooked by that opening. I also noticed James Mangold's unique style here. I actually really enjoyed his style, and I feel a new director was needed because we had 4 Spielberg films in a row, and I felt him falling off. While I don't think that Mangold was as good as he was in Logan, that was one of the best Comic book films of all time. He brings a unique style, with his colour grading, and I was happy with him in the director's chair.The first act saw Indie's look at life, and his lack of feeling welcome. I love his performance from Harrison Ford. I didn't love Ford in Kingdom of Crystal Skull, but he was great here. He did a Blade Runner 2049 level performance here, and I felt the emotion. My main issue with his character is why he feels not welcome. There is a reveal, about half way through the film, that is so important I think it should have been shown, not told. The first act I feel could have been a bit longer. Within 10 minutes of seeing Indie older, there is another scene of raiding, which I feel makes us not fully be able to resonate with Indie. Indie meets the main side character, Helena, played by Phoebe Waller Bridge. She began being not that likeable, and I wasn't really into her character. But as we went on, she became more likeable. Also, Phoebe Waller Bridge played the character very well. We are introduced to are villains, the main one being Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen. I felt he was slightly generic, and the way they try to make you hate him wasn't the best. However, Mads Mikkelsen was great and really committed. The other two villains are henchmen, played by Boyd Holbrook and Olivier Richters. I actually really enjoyed them, but they were quite generic. I also have to mention how wasted Shaunette Renée Wilson's character of Mason feels, who I feel had a lot of potential. The first act has a lot of fun to be had, as we see chases, horse riding and action scenes. Obviously Harrison Ford can't do all of the stunts, but I feel he did his best.The second act has a couple of issues. For one, we see a lot of Indie's friends, however, they are only in one or two scenes. It kind of feels like they were trying to do fan service, but they didn't do it very well. Also, it felt like at one point, they realised that they needed to have an action scene, so just have a random action scene, with a random other party. It just felt like they needed a certain number of action scenes, so just put random people in here. I also had some issues with John Williams score, almost feeling like it was the wrong time. There is a chase scene, and then it just plays epic hero music. It was just frustrating. We also met the character of Teddy, who was one of the weaker elements. I don't like to hate on child actors, but I just don't like the performance. It kind of feels like a rip off of Short Round from the Temple of Doom, just not done too well. There are three action scenes in the second act, which I think is a bit too many. This hurts the pacing a bit, as I would have liked to see more character moments, but the good thing is you are never bored. We see Mads Mikkelsen fully commit here, which does make them quite fun. There is an underwater scene which I feel does lot look to good, so I was kind of taken out of the film. Also, there is some quite interesting editing from Andrew Buckland, Michael McCusker and Dirk Westervelt. I'm not sure it's my favourite editing in the world, but it is interesting.The third act is where the main issue comes in. The main device is one that can turn back time, and I knew what was going to happen but didn't like when it happened. I feel like the character arcs for our main characters all mostly worked, apart from Indie, more on that later. The villain doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion, so that was also frustrating. I just feel like the third act was so crazy, and out there, that I didn't really enjoy it too well. It felt too cgi filled and felt not like the rest of the film. However, I do actually think that the visuals were good, and the cinematography from Phedon Papamichael was super enjoyable. The fight choreography was also a treat. However, the most frustrating thing was how Indiana Jones' character arc ended. I don't want to go into spoilers, but it tries to do something that just doesn't work, and then tries something else, which again, doesn't work. It was frustrating because Indiana Jones himself is the most important part of the film, and they don't get him right.Overall, this film is a fun time. Harrison Ford deliver my favourite performance of the series, James Mangold has some interesting direction, and the visuals are stunning. However, the third act gets too crazy, and fails to give a good send off to Indiana Jones.My score is:
Plot - 6/10
First Act - 8/10

Third Act - 5/10

"alindsayal","19 February 2023","We have made it to the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the start of Phase 5 Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania, I have watched it now and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Ant-Man, The Wasp & their family sent into The Quantum Realm, where they come face to face with Kang The Conqueror.Main Character
Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang and I think once again he does a great job. He has plenty to do this time and his character has truly progressed since his first film. He is more confident as an Avenger and this shows in how he acts. His character has a clear progression and it is great to see Rudd deliver this really fun performance. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Wasp played by Evangeline Lily. The only reason I am putting her as a main character is because her name is in the title but she is given nothing to do in the film. Lily has shown that she can give development to Hope Van Dyne but she is really pushed to the side for other characters as that is a shame.Supporting Characters
The real star of the film for me though was Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror, Majors knocks it out of the park and provides a chilling and charismatic performance as this new antagonist. He has huge shoes to fill from Thanos and I was worried he would be saved for his future appearances but he is in this film a lot and he is given a chance to thrive and give a glimpse of what could be to come. Michael Pfeiffer plays Janet Van Dyne and she is given so much screen time here, we learn more about her time in the Quantum Realm and Pfeiffer does a great job in fleshing out this character that we have barely seen on screen. Kathryn Newton is the recast for Cassie Lang and she is a fun character here, the dynamic between her and Rudd is well realised and she is given plenty to do here which I mostly like. Michael Douglas is back as Hank Pym and despite having less to do, he is still enjoyable and still seems to have his passion for the character and the role.Story
The story was okay, my favourite parts were learning more about the backstory of Kang and what exactly Janet was up to during her time in The Quantum Realm. It was nice seeing some progression and development in Ant-Man from his actions in Endgame. But as I mentioned before, the film completely underuses Wasp and as a major character that is a big shame. Also, the final act makes some decisions that I am not sure works for what the audience are told in the film with way too much taking place.Script
The script was good. With it being an Ant-Man film there was plenty of humour here and the majority worked for me. It also had good drama and for the most part the two tones are separate and work well together.Style
The film is mostly set in The Quantum Realm and that means there is plenty of CGI here and for the most part it looks great. The visuals are very striking and colourful which makes it interesting and dynamic. The film is also paced pretty well, with the runtime feeling appropriate. But I felt like the action scenes could have been filmed better, there was a lot of shaky cam going on especially early on that made it hard to focus.Overall
Overall, Ant-Man and The Wasp is a good film that does an effective job of delivering an interesting film that sets up the future of The MCU. It probably fits in the middle in terms of quality of Ant-Man films but if you enjoy these films then it is worth a watch.Rating - 7/10.","7/10"
"alindsayal","21 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse was one of my favourite comic book films ever, and after all these years the sequel, Across The Spider-Verse has been released and I have finally had a chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Miles Morales travel across the multiverse where he meets other Spider-Men that at are charged with protecting it, Miles must understand what it takes to be a true hero.Main Character
Shameik Moore is back as Miles Morales and he is fantastic. He plays the teenage spider-man very well and he is easily likeable which is great to see. There is more to him though, Moore adds real emotion to the story of Morales and the things he goes through is well done. Gwen Stacy voiced by Hailee Steinfeld gets way more to do in this film and I would argue her character is as important as Miles. She gives such an emotional performance and Gwen is a character that we learn a lot about and see how she really fits into this story. The dynamic between both characters is really well delivered and I am glad it worked so well.Supporting Characters
This film has probably the most amount of characters a film ever has, so I certainly won't be going through all of them but I will acknowledge that they are all great.Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez return as Miles parents and they are a large part of this story. Seeing how the dynamic between Miles and his parents goes down is a really crucial element of this film and the two performers did a great job.Oscar Isaac plays Miguel O'Hara and is fantastic. It seems like he is becoming the king of comic book films and shows and he is no different here, O'Hara is the leader of the team of Spider-Men and he is the most serious character in this film. As you learn more about him, you understand why he does what he does and it makes him a really interesting character.Jake Johnson is back as Peter B Parker, though he has a much smaller role. Even though he isn't in the film a huge amount he is used effectively and I felt like he was somebody that added to the overall story of the film and how it affects Miles life.There are some other great characters specifically Jason Schwartzman as The Spot, Issa Rae as Jessica Drew and Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk. They all were fun additions to the cast here.Story
The story is fantastic. As I mentioned above, it focuses equally on Miles Morales & Gwen Stacy and it deals with both stories incredibly well. This film exceeds what the majority of people would expect for an animated film with the amount of depth and emotion that goes ahead with these characters and the situations that they are put in. This is also a great ending, which feels appropriate for the film and effects every character that has been a spotlight of the film.Script
The script is really great. The comedy is well written, this film is funny and not in a childish way. It is clever with its comedy and it picks appropriate times to use it. But the drama is where the film succeeds, you really do care about these characters and how the events in the film change the characters.Style
The first film was amazing to look at and so creative in its design. This film is even better, you can't take your eyes off the screen because of the colours and use of technical devices that no ever film does like it. This films pacing is great too, it clearly has different acts to the film and I was never bored,Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is an Epic film that just like its predecessor is one of the best comic book films ever made. Ignore the fact that it is an animated film, this is an amazing film and especially for Spider-Man films needs to be see.Rating - 10/10.","6/10"
"alindsayal","26 January 2024","Over the years, Jason Statham has been a part of plenty of action films which have differentiated in quality. We have another one with The Beekeeper and I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after someone close to him is robbed and killed, a Beekeeper goes on a revenge mission showcasing his former skills.Main Character
As mentioned above, Statham has played the lead role in an action film many times and he does a great job here, it feels like he can play this role in his sleep. It isn't the toughest role he has ever taken on but it just works and he adds some legitimacy for this role and it is fun to see him play a Beekeeper.Supporting Characters
Josh Hutcherson plays an annoying bad guy here and it took a while but I liked his performance here. He is just so arrogant and annoying that you really want to see him get taken down and this made me root for Statham even more in this film.Jeremy Irons plays the head of the company that Statham is after. He again is good in the role and is charisma is on full display here. It is probably one of the easiest pay checks that he has ever got but he is clearly enjoying the role.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays a cop and I didn't really care for her performance. She is a bit over the top and her character just makes some strange decisions and it is kind of convoluting as to why she does certain things in the film.Bobby Naderi plays her partner and he is also cheesy and really over the top. The two of them have decent chemistry but for me it doesn't really work in this film.Story
The story is pretty basic here and focuses on this guys revenge mission and in that it is pretty cool and exciting seeing Statham's character go after the people that have wronged him and the people he knows. There is also a pretty cool twist towards the end of the film that made things way more interesting. But some of the others character motivations are pretty strange and the overall explanation for Statham's training doesn't work with other things that happen in the film. Worse of all is the really abrupt ending of the film that doesn't really answer any questions and feels really out of place.Script
This is where the film really falls flat and that is the writing. This film has some real cringe worthy dialogue here, especially when it comes to the bee metaphors. But it is like the film doesn't have an ending and like the writers weren't sure what to do.Style
The film has some really great action sequences. The majority of people are just here to see Jason Statham beat up and kill people and you get that here in spades and it is easily the highlight of the film. The film also has pretty good pacing, it doesn't overstay its welcome and I thought moved pretty well.Overall
Overall, The Beekeeper is an above average action film. Statham is great and the action is fun to watch but it is exactly what you would expect. This is probably one to watch when it comes to streaming at home instead of rushing to the cinema to watch it.Rating - 6/10.","6/10"

I thought that this movie was going to be along the same lines as that movie. After all, all of the trailers pitch it as a war between the apes and man. I was really looking forward to it. I liked the last two movies. They were not as good as the original series but were still interesting SF movies in their own right. Also, everything has been better than the Tim Burton Planet of the apes.So I put on my 3d glasses and sat down in Wood Green London to watch the war that would change the face of the planet. So there is a brief skirmish. Then the head ape Corny (as the plot is) sets out to find those responsible for doing wrong to him (yawn). Bring on the WAR I thought. Then they ride around for a bit. Next, we get Escape from Colditz, the great escape or Prison Break. I am still waiting for the promised war. At that end, there is a battle. Not against the apes as they are all escaping. Though unfortunately none of them get on a motorcycle and try to jump over barriers.I walked out of the cinema and thought what a pile of dung.The 3d is pathetic. Really this is a movie that could have been good in 3d but wasn't. It is at least 40 minutes too long. Also, it is not the movie they promised. There are no wars in it. It is littered with mistakes. My favourite is the 350-pound gorilla on a horse. No, that horse would have been dead.Lastly and this is my normal grump. Why did it not say it was based on Planet of the apes by Pierre Boulle? No mention of him in this shamefully bad movie.I really wanted to like this movie. What I got was a movie that surpassed Burton's POTA's for the worst one in the series.","9/10"
"allmoviesfan","1 July 2023","So happy to have Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones - the iconic Indiana Jones - back on the big screen. Some impressive CGI work to make Indy a young man again as he battles the Nazis at the end of World War Two before events fast forward about twenty years, though the Nazis are still the bad guys. I've always said that Indiana Jones is at his best when battling the Nazis, and it is true again in the fifth and final instalment of the series. Indiana Jones is a world-weary, basically-retired archaeologist when he is roped into one last adventure, basically against his will. The fedora is there, the whip, the impish grin and the occasional one-liner. So are the big action set pieces that have made the series so popular, and I liked the nods to Father Time (which I guess no one can escape) that permeate the movie, as Indiana Jones looks to his future, whilst fighting a foe from his younger days, with a couple of well-designed cameos from familiar faces. A delight to sit in the cinema and watch a fitting conclusion to one of my favourite film series. Thoroughly enjoyed this.","5/10"
"AlsExGal","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","10/10"
"alwinsup","2 February 2024","A good none brain thinking action movie. Plenty of things happen during the movie. Good amount of action, story line, acting, build-up time, etc, etc.Jason Statham, as always, delivers his A-performance. At first I was doubtfull; will it not be a movie that is put togheter in less then 4 weeks? However it has a decent quality. People clearly thought about the story line before shooting it. The extra deepness of the story arround the ''bee-keepers'' instead of just acting the average middle class guy gave it a nice extra touch.Just buy your snacks and drink and relax a bit! You will have a good easy time!","7/10"
"amanda_lockworth","3 March 2013","This movie starts slow. The shipwreck scene at sea is only somewhat believable, if you allow yourself to be distracted by the CGI, but it drags, and the references to religion are just a mish-mash of ancient superstition that don't mesh well with the supposed story being told. In the end we learn there is possibly another story that is the ""truth"", and which is preferred? Well I liked neither. And neither story was ""true"" since all was fiction to begin with.""Life of Pi"" felt like a story that wanted to go somewhere but didn't know how to, like the author was Pi and trying to figure out how to write a story for the first time, hoping that the proposed alternate story at the end would give the time spent on the rest of the tale some sort of validity, which it didn't. It reminds me of a joke I heard a few years back, one of those jokes where I wondered why I wasted my time listening to it, and I will repeat it here, giving it a Life-of-Pi ending:One day, Juan is out trimming his hedges. His neighbor looks over and says, ""Juan, you're a great guy. You don't beat your wife, abuse your kids, or kick your dog. You should run for Mayor!""So Juan runs for Mayor. People see what a great guy he is, and they elect him.After his term is over, Juan is back out to his hedges. His neighbor looks over again. ""Juan, you're a great guy. You don't beat your wife, abuse your kids, or kick your dog. You should run for Senator!""So Juan runs for Senator. People see what a great guy he is, and they elect him.After his term is over, Juan is back out to his hedges. His neighbor looks over again. ""Juan, you're a great guy. You don't beat your wife, abuse your kids, or kick your dog. You should run for President!""So Juan runs for President. People see he's a great guy- doesn't beat his wife, abuse his kids, or kick his dog. So they elect him. However, as Juan is sitting in the Oval Office one day, a shady man in a black coat walks in and says, ""Juan, you're a great guy. But you need to start screwing up- beat your wife, abuse your kids, and start kicking your dog. Or I'll kill you."" So Juan begins to beat his wife, abuse his kids, and kick his dog. After a while of this, Juan's old neighbor comes in.""Juan, what are your doing? You used to be a great guy- now your family is gone and your dog has run away! You need to fix things up, or I'll kill you!""So Juan is freaking out, but he decides to go out with honor. He patches things up with his wife and kids, and he gets a new dog. The next day, the shady man comes into his office and shoots Juan with a golf gun.What's a golf gun? -I don't know, but it sure made a hole in Juan.That was a stupid joke -Which do you like better, the stupid joke or ""Life of Pi?""The stupid joke -So it is with God.","10/10"
"amatullahdaya","5 July 2023","Watched this today and went in with some high hopes because Indiana jones were some of the best movies growing up. The theater wasnt very crowded but then again I guess not many of the younger generation know the movies or have even watched them.The opening was good but I could see where the anti-aging or de-aging process was used which made it difficult to unsee. It was a bit nostalgic in a way to see a ""young"" harrison playing Indi and chasing bad guy, impersonating bad guys and using his bag of tricks.The middle part of the plot is Indiana now older, a bit depressed and sad and the character of Helena, his god daughter is introduced. I do not like her character much and I do not think she was the best for the role.The climax was an okay ending. I expected some kind of twist and was hoping to see more of a younger Indiana Jones going back in time to live through some more adventures but since this is a farewell movie (I guess) it was an okay way to end.It was an average watch. Not the best from Indiana Jones but its watchable.","5/10"
"amca1960","9 July 2023","I didn't hate this film, but I enjoyed it far less than I expected to. (I enjoyed it more than my partner though, who fell asleep during it.) But it was still far less than it could have been.On the plus side: Harrison Ford is still amazing, and can easily carry off an action adventure. There are the usual splendid scenes of Indy fighting on all sorts of moving vehicles. The baddies - Nazis - are easy to dislike. Ethann Isidore as Teddy was simply wonderful - I wish more could have been made of him.That being said, there didn't seem to be anything really new and exciting about this film. Almost all the action scenes we seem to have seen before: cars and motorbikes with sidecars; trains; it's all been done before. A nice touch though was a wild ride through Tangiers on auto-rickshaws - who knew that these little cheap vehicles were in fact turbo-charged and built (to judge from the battering they received) like tanks?The supporting characters were weak. Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw was a poor foil; you couldn't work out if she had any depth at all; she kept saying (even if it wasn't true) that it was ""all about the money"". She simply wasn't a sympathetic character. Mads Mikkelsen as the Nazi Jürgen Voller again played his cards very close to his chest (as it were), delivering most of his lines in a sort of guarded mutter that was at times hard to understand. At no time did he exude any sort of air of malice. It was as though he simply had a job to do; he made for a boring villain.And the humour - always a nice touch in the best Indiana Jones films, was here in very short supply.One of the delights of Indiana Jones films is the inventive ways in which the villains meet their end: recall the melting scene towards the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark; the way that Donovan ages to dust in The Last Crusade. In this film, though, Voller simply dies in a plane crash (albeit in Ancient Greece) - a very prosaic end.And of course - like so many current films - it was too long for its content. Half an hour shaved off and a tighter direction may have made for a better and more disciplined film.My partner, who's Tamil, said that it was a masala (mixture) of a film, and totally lacking in Bollywood singing and dancing. Come to think of it, he's quite right.I'm sorry to see the Indiana Jones films end with this one. It could have been so much better.","1/10"
"amerikasend","3 May 2018","This movie was kind of like an episode of TWD. Just a bunch of people chit-chatting with each other with boring action sequences. The premise of the movie was laughable and I'm a bit surprised that it's the best Disney/Marvel could come up with. It was like something DC/WB would come up with.","10/10"
"amesmonde","30 June 2023","Indiana Jones and his estranged goddaughter, Helena Shaw, try to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can alter the outcome of World War II.James Mangold steps into some big shoes and delivers a poignant Indiana Jones journey set primarily in 1969. The set-ups never quite match the film's 1944 opening with its exhilarating set-pieces, but the stunts and staging remain engaging throughout notably the parade chase and under water search. The banter between characters, written by a handful of writers, is executed well. As well as chases, shootouts, fights and whip-action there's henchmen, drinking and supernatural high jinks, synonymous with the film adventures. The narrative welcomingly weaves in MacGuffins and supernatural elements like its predecessors, even if dropping a very lengthy mystical, fantasy based closing act.Dial of Destiny offers an emotional journey for Indiana Jones, and its poignant moments add depth and meaning to Harrison Ford's beloved character Henry Jones Jr. These character-driven elements contribute to the film's dramatic impact. The supporting cast, while many of the characters feel like extended cameos, are on form. Antonio Banderas leaves his trademark charm and intensity, and both John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen lend weight to the overall narrative. Toby Jones is likable, and Boyd Holbrook leaves an impression, along with Mads Mikkelsen, who adds screen presence with a sense of intrigue and depth.While Dial of Destiny successfully delivers an entertaining adventure, it falls short in fully capitalizing on the nostalgia factor. There are missed opportunities to acknowledge or mention beloved characters like Short Round, Willie Scott, and Wu Han. Or draw dialogue comparisons of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Shaw to Marion Ravenwood, or Ethann Isidore's Teddy Kumar character to Short Round. It lacks the same immersive quality found in the earlier Indiana Jones movies, and hazy background and lighting/CGI effects, like in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's ending, are distractingly littered throughout. It maybe too late, unless Indiana is recast like James Bond or the technology is perfected, you can't help feel we need more live action adventures set in the late 1920s or 1930s.Despite these minor setbacks, Dial of Destiny remains a captivating adventure that showcases Harrison Ford's enduring portrayal of Indiana Jones, even if the tone is in the first two acts is quite grounded. That said, both Steven Spielberg, Philip Kaufman and George Lucas Indy DNA is present, cemented by John Williams fantastic score.Overall, Mangold's Dial of Destiny may not entirely capture the nostalgic magic of the first three, but it stands on its own as a commendable emotional addition to the beloved franchise.","7/10"
"amit_imt2002","8 January 2013","Pi Patel is the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry,India and when the business fails they decide to move to Canada and sell the animals off.The family sets off on a Japanese ship with all the animals on board, much like Noah's ark,only this time the biblical floods have been replaced by Indira Gandhi's emergency.But that does not make it a political film! There is a perfect storm at sea and Pi somehow finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.The smaller animals fall victim to the food chain and Pi is left alone with the tiger.We are now faced with a simple question, are there two animals on the boat or one human and one animal? This is one of the pillars of our belief system.If we believe the we humans are in a league of our own and above all other animals we fall roughly into the camp of those who also believe in intelligent design and therefore puts us immediately at loggerheads with environmental issues.To accept Darwinian evolution and mix it with spirituality is one of the key challenges and part of the bigger question of reconciling science and religion in a post industrialized world.Children are born atheists and amoral.They acquire morality and faith or a combination of both as the result of a variety of factors driven primarily by parents.My 5 year old daughter is drawn to the creamy layer of Hindu Gods( out of the teeming masses of no less than 33 million) when she listens to stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. At school they pray to a secular God everyday.Yet she lives happily in an atheist household.What her beliefs will be I do not know, I merely intent to give her the gift of choice, while gently reinforcing my rationalist standpoint which I regard as my moral duty, just as my parents felt it was theirs to imbibe in me the fear of God.The key question of why Pi was drawn to religion remains open. He ends up a professor of theology.The 200+ day ordeal can change anybody profoundly.The trapped Chilean miners contemplated resorting to cannibalism to survive.Danny Boyles 27 Hours is another true example of the triumph of the human spirit when the protagonist amputates his own arm to survive. So the fictional story of a boy who survived impossible odds should not make us religious. The film is shot magnificently, its a superlative act of visualization to bring this story to the screen and Ang Lee certainly has that gift. Intriguingly, the way he handles the Indian angle of the film and the prelude to the fateful voyage reminds me of Mira Nair's work in The Namesake which was a lesser film but filled with some of the same elements, a boy who grows up with an improbable and embarrassing name, the presence of Irrfan Khan and Tabu and the challenges of an immigrant family in the alien landscape of America as a nuanced adventure, thematically similar to Pi stranded with a tiger in the vast oceans.There is a scene at the end of the film where Pi parts ways with his feline companion.Richard Parker does not look back at Pi to bid him farewell and walks away unemotionally while Pi sobs with heartbreak.The tiger and its fear kept Pi alive, which is an interesting counterintuitive logic where fear keeps us alive.Perhaps an emotional void is mans biggest enemy. As he recounts the story many years later his eyes well up with tears again.We are supposed to feel that humans have a monopoly over emotions and this sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, which is factually incorrect. Richard Parker deserves to be cut some slack as he has just survived an equal or probably even greater ordeal at sea!Mention must be made of Suraj Sharma who went to the audition to accompany his brother but landed the role out of 3000 aspirants.He does an outstanding job as a gangly youth who fights his circumstances with remarkable ingenuity and pluck.But the star of this visual feast must surely be the CGI tiger who looks us in the eye and brings to mind William Blakes classic poem The Tyger( a wonderful way to spell,sadly rectified in our school anthology) from his collection Songs of Experience, which was a sister poem of The Lamb.Pi is the Lamb here.When the Royal Bengal Tiger walks into the pages of history he will not look back with emotion at us humans who proved to be his worst enemies.We will be left wiping away our tears at having lost the most beautiful creature ever to our greed, indifference and arrogance. William Blake's poem brought to life by Ang Lee in the Life of Pi will hopefully survive for our children to fire their imagination.","2/10"
"amiticiae","17 February 2023","I have had the privilege and fortune to be able to watch it on opening day in 3D. I personally mostly enjoyed it, but I found some flaws with it.Let's get to the positives first. Majors was genuinely threatening and scary as Kang, his gravitas being genuinely scary and chilling for the entire multiverse. He has managed to be a legitimate contender to Thanos' throne as MCU's biggest villain yet. Another positive I can note is the humor. Now, I did not laugh out loud at every single joke that the film had to offer, but its heart was mostly genuine, and some of it did land. (MODOK's appearance was ironically pretty funny to me, the CGI monstrosity was... something.)Now let me get to the negatives. If it weren't for the fact I watched it in 3D, I think it would be obvious most of the time that they are on a green screen in a CGI world. The creatures in the Quantum Realm were mostly uninspired. It was clear they had taken references from other sources and... eh. It kinda looked busy.The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he lives his life in San Francisco. It all starts off normally until his daughter, Cassie, gets freed from prison after she was in some sort of protest or whatever? Then they go to Hank's lab or something and they discover that they can communicate with the Quantum Realm. That machine goes wrong and they get transported into the Quantum Realm. They find their way in, learn a bunch of customs and, after drinking some slime, can communicate with whatever creatures there are in this realm.Then at some point, Ant-Man, Hope, Hank, Cassie and all the others get separated, things go on, Bill Murray appears and is freaking cool, at some point there comes Kang, some more things happen, then it really begins to end when Ant-Man, Hope and Cassie stand alongside Kang, and Kang says ""I conquer worlds, you talk with ants"" and Hank just comes with a CGI army of ants to save the day, and then they're in some tower and the little guy has to sacrifice, then it's kinda bittersweet.Fine plot, it works, it was entertaining, but honestly I liked what 3D could bring to me and my favorite part was when the screen went dark and he got into the nucleum and there was the Storm of Possibilities, pretty cool CGI. Entertaining, good as an introduction to Kang, but not much else. Could have been a lot better.","3/10"

Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays.

"amwilburn-60131","22 March 2023","We went in not knowing what to expect, and we probably enjoyed it more as a result. It's a fun film; fitting with the tone of the first two.I have 2 gripes with this film, both cast related. First off, without Michael Pena, this isn't quite as funny. He stole the a lot of the scenes in the first 2 films. Also, I get why they recast the excellent Abby Ryder Fortson for Endgame (the actress would have been too young to play Cassie Lang for the 2023 time frame of Endgame (Emma Fuhrmann, 17 at the time of filming, fit Cassie's MCU age of 16 better, and actually resembled an older Fortson), so *that recasting* made sense. But in the time-frame of Quantumania (which takes places in 2025) Cassie's supposed to be 18, Furman was 21, but definitely could've played 18. Instead they recast someone even older... Katherine Newton was 25 during shooting, doesn't resemble the other 2 Cassies, nor quite as good an actress.Still, tons of action, comedy (that's funny within the context of the situation), and a mysterious backstory (but really only
mysterious if you haven't been watching the Disney+ MCU shows). It's a joyride, never a dull moment, although sometimes the plot meandered. It was nice that Janet and Hank got a lot more to do this time around.Modok (scene during the trailers) makes sense within the context of the MCU, Majors is appropriately mancing as Kang. I don't know what's with the low Rotton Tomatoes, I can't wait to see this again.A-, 9.1/103D: 3D usually doesn't work in dark movies (which was the downfall of both Wakanda Forever & Malificent's 3D), but surprisingly works here... when it matters. Scenes where the 3D wouldn't do much to enhance the experience, the 3D was practically non-existent. For scenes where it would make a difference, the stereoscopic imagining was pretty good (I noticed only 1 brief scene where the depth frustrums didn't line up creating a double image in the mid background, otherwise it was always clean)6.5/10 for the 3D. By comparison Shang Chi's was a 10/10, Wakanda Forever's 3D was a 3/10.","1/10"

Pi grows up in India where his parents own a zoo. He is teased at school due to his name but he is smart and aims for the attractive girl in the music class for which he plays an instrument. When his father receives possible job opportunities in Canada they load up some of the animals for sale and set sail via ship but a nasty storm hits. Pi is the only survivor as he shivers in a lifeboat in terror as the ship rapidly sinks. His only company is an injured zebra, an orangutan, a spotted hyena, and a Bengal tiger. When hunger takes effect the hyena kills the zebra and later on the orangutan but is demolished in return by the first appearance of the tiger. Central plot regards Pi struggling to adapt to living with this tiger and the fascinating adventure they endure, which he narrates now in his fifties to a writer who takes in every spoken word with great interest. Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi narrating his experience, while Suraj Sharma plays the younger Pi who uses every possible resource to survive and co-exist with a tiger. Adil Hussain plays his strict yet resourceful father who questions Pi's introduction to Christianity. Rafe Spall plays the writer who is asked ""which"" story he prefers.

Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:

THE LIFE OF PI captures the sadness of losing the ones you love too fast. This story was never going to be put into film, but the director has done the best of what he was given. He and the producers did an outstanding job with the effects as well! As for the originality, never have you seen this before.","1/10"
"andrewchristianjr","30 April 2019","Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs.","6/10"
"andrewmgardner-84441","20 January 2019","It really was an amazing movie. It leaves you wanting more makes you want to know what comes next makes you want to know more about characters you wouldn't even normally care about for how much they put in this one movie and the fact that flowed all together it was a rather Flawless movie and I couldn't wait to see it and I watched it before I even finished Dragon Ball super the series I'm on episode 125 and I'm not disappointed do yourself a favor get the kid out in yourself and go and watch this","10/10"
"angelamiatt","21 June 2023","...But this film was awful.The story was ridiculous in all ways.Firstly, Hopes mother was in the quantum realm and never told her husband about the entire universe there, with all the species and lives and complex environments.Secondly the ants happened to follow them into the quantum universe but ""on a different stream"" and therefore had eternities to develop and become super intelligent.Thirdly - what the hell was MODOX about? Some second rate character who suddenly appeared in the quantum realm as a head?!Finally, while CGI is great, it loses any excitement when it is the ENTIRE FILM! All I can think of while watching this is that the entire film was filmed in one room on a green screen ... NOTHING is real.I watched this film over 3 weeks in batches of 10 minutes as I was bored. I am never bored of a film. I watch everything! But this film is boring!Honestly - if you need an MCU hit, rewatch one of the Avengers films!","8/10"
"AngelHonesty","29 June 2023","There is not enough good things I can say about this movie, except, go and watch it, its amazing. I have never seen a sequel so good, I honestly think it was better then the first film. The movie is beautifully constructed. The art work is phenomenal and story is extremely interesting. It has everything in a movie that you could ask for and its great for all audiences. There is no agenda being pushed, or political message trying to be told, instead its just a good old fashion movie with a ton of fun, action and adventure, great family values and innocent love. It has the perfect balance of everything. The art work is stunning. And the story is captivating. I could honestly sit and watch this movie over and over again.","6/10"
"AngelHonesty","4 June 2023","Its a Kang Movie, not an ant-man movie. The film introduces Kang to us, who I assume is going to be the next big bad, just like Thanos. It's setting up our villain. Not a bad thing at all, but it took away from Ant-man. It felt like this wasn't really his movie, he was just there and so was everyone else. The story felt very rushed. It was all action and very little story telling. They tried to make into this ""big thing"" from Janet's past that she never wanted to talk about. But it was poorly executed and came off almost boring, it had too much foretelling.I loved the Quantum realm itself. The film did a great job showing it and the creatures. But I think it could have dived more into showing the realm and the stories of the creatures. Instead it focused on other things it really didn't need to. But the characters were fun especially the blob with no holes. But all in all, the film is definitely lacking.","7/10"

It is not even ""it is so bad it is good"" it just plain bad with a cler intention to emulate John Wick but without the talent in the writing.This movie takes itself way too seriously and is a total missed opportunity to touch on serious things like scammers and computer fraud.Avoid, theres a 1000 way better actioon flick to watch or look forward to.","2/10"
"anibal-portillo","9 February 2019","It's a great movie, the history is quite different than the original, but certainly the flow with the DBS saga is great and compatible, is credible.

"anibalcnso","5 June 2023","My expectations were high with this film due to several reasons, especially taking into account how good the first one was. And still, it exceeded all of them. I cannot explain anything that hasn't been already told by everyone, critics and fans alike: the animation, the story-line, the soundtrack, the action scenes... everything is perfect and calculated even to the last detail. So polished, so carefully prepared. When the end of the film hit, I was ready to watch one more hour of the story, so it leaves you wanting, asking for more. In a 2 hour movie that is a tremendous achievement.I enjoyed it like a child and I could watch it several times more until the final part releases, which has a very difficult bar to reach, by the way.","10/10"

"anirudhjaura","25 November 2012","I often try to use the movie name or something about it as part of my blog title. However, nothing short of 'spell-binding' does justice to this one. Ang Lee brings to life practically the impossible – a supposedly unfilmable book is presented in a manner that is a treat for the senses making Life of Pi a must-watch all the way!! Life of Pi starts off slow and after a time you begin wondering where's all the water, animals and action you saw in the trailer - but patience bears fruit. Once the adventure begins you are completely swept away and by the time the film reaches its abrupt intermission (since there's really no intermission in a Hollywood movie) you are well entrenched in the adventure and in no mood for a break. There's a lot of talk about the 3D of Life of Pi being better than Avatar. I'd just say that Life of Pi is presented in 3D in an Avatar of its own, the kind that perfectly suits the story that is told. The 3D isn't as extravagant, but peaks up at exactly the right moments and some scenes are sure to give you the thrills you would seek from a 3D movie. Clearly some lessons for all and sundry on how to use 3D in a movie However, while its a visual spectacle, Life of Pi is a real winner more because of the kind of depth its storyline offers. On the face of it, its an adventure, a tale of courage, hope and survival all very well but peel the layers and you find profound depth and meaning to everything you've witnessed in an entirely different light. I myself believe that I have only scratched the surface of what Life of Pi has to offer apart from its visual treat and best of all the director doesn't push you to think in any given direction. Its for you to think, explore and ponder or not The performances are top notch too, Suraj Sharma the protagonist does a decent job and pulls off a difficult role. The treatment to his character and his visual appearance is thoughtful and consistent, making his unbelievable story come to life. Irrfan Khan delivers yet again and though his initial accent is a little unbecoming, his emotional delivery later in the movie takes the cake. So does Adil Hussain impress with his impeccable accent and delivery in the earlier part of the movie. The only one wasted, is Tabu who given her range of performance is given a rather simple and short role The real star of the show is however, Ang Lee – first for believing that such a movie was possible and secondly for presenting it so wondrously - with scenes shot under and over water, at close quarters with a royal Bengal tiger and a host of other superb sequences. After one has almost given up here comes a real winner. One should never lose hope..so is the case with God, and Hollywood too I guess ;)To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com","9/10"
"AnishMisra","11 October 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a film directed by Matt Reeves. I loved the first 2 films of this series. And was looking forward to this film for quite some time. Finally when I saw the film, I can definitely say I'm Spechless. This film is definitely one of the best 2017 has to offer.Plot: Caesar and his ape family face the wrath of a ruthless Colonel.Story and direction: The film is basically an arc. It started with Caeser as a small child, then the Caesar who grew up for the torture his community suffered and finally to fight back. This film is a masterpiece in itself. And not only in terms of production quality, but the story is so pure. It touches upon things that I was quite shocked to see. The very first scene of this film, sets the tone of the film to be very dark. But then we see that Caesar doesn't just want out to go on killing humans, he just want them to back off his ape community. Then we see his visions of Koba as to what he did to him. Blue Eyes' mate Lake was also a very significant character. I did resonate with her in the scene where she sees Blue Eyes after a long time. But certain events then happen, that force Caesar to do things that are quite dark. And then a dialogue, ""You are no less than Koba"" by Maurice was so thought provoking. Then we have Nova, the girl who initially was scared of the apes but finally decides to be with them in their cause, because she saw the apes for how good they were. And finally Bad Ape. I guess that was a great addition to this franchise. His fear and his humor (which was subtle) were all very justified. The way he says he gets his name was good. Michael Giacchino's music is to look out for. The VFX is top notch. It never felt like the VFX was fake. It felt so natural. The sets too very magnificent and natural to the setting of the story.Performances: Andy Serkis should take a bow from me. What a performance and what a genius he is. I couldn't imagine Caesar without this person. Woody Harrelson was also great as Colonel. He has his moments too. Amiah Miller was also great as Nova. Steve Zahn was just right for Bad Ape. Toby Kebbell was also good as the cold ape Koba (for the little screen time he received). A special mention to Terry Notary for Maurice. The way he supports Caesar is commendable.Favorite Scene: The scene where Caesar regrets not recognizing the hate Koba had for humans. Then Maurice says a very nice dialogue that one cannot know what feels inside. This dialogue has just made a seat in my minds. And it basically says about our society in general.Verdict: This is one of those films where I can say that the third part is the best. I couldn't take out a flaw in this film. I was spellbound as the credits were rolling. This film series will have a special place in my life.I am going to give this film a wholeheartedly deserving 10/10.","10/10"

"anon-00001","10 June 2023","So far the greatest movie of 2023, and one of the best I have seen on the big screen in the latest years.Being excited about a movie usually means it won't exceed expectations however this one somehow manages to do just that. With amazing animation, great dialogue and character building it becomes a worthy successor to the first movie and even surpasses it in some ways, while the the first movie had a better score then this one it still succeeds to do better then the predecessor in almost every other way.This movie touches more on building other characters then Miles and let's those other characters shine far more then the first movie let them
All in all I believe the movie deserves many awards and a success in the box office like no other movie released this year.","9/10"

Colorful cinematography.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is much Better than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Second movie of James Allen Mangold, that I enjoyed watching after Ford vs Ferrari.It's interesting that Harrison Ford was more nimble in this role than the role in Blade runner 2049 witch was 6 years ago.Mads Mikkelsen was just Mads Mikkelsen.Something I disliked was how flat bad guys were just like in comics or Bond movies.Go and watch it on cinemas - the sound was 20/20.","6/10"
"antialias11","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","9/10"
"antoniatejedabarros","13 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is one of the best Indiana Jones movies (my favorites are this one and Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom). I don't get the ""critics"" (how easy is to criticise when you create nothing). This sequel is super fun, entertaining, human, and cool. Absolutely gorgeous art direction, flawless special effects, and -the most important thing- a great story line. My three children and I had a terrific time. This is a movie for teenagers and for Indiana Jones lovers. I only feel that the cast could have been better (there are some anachronisms and, yes, I still find there there were too little women). Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has archeology, mathematics, and history involved, so, thanks a lot to the writers for finally moving away from the ""TaNaK/Bible"" narrative. Harrison Ford's performance is stunning. Today (July 13) he turns 81 years old and his Indiana Jones character was flawless, human and deep. A movie for having fun, learn a bit of history, and enjoying. 9/10 (1 point for the script, 1 point for Archimedes, 1 point for Harrison Ford, 1 point for Mads Mikkelsen, 1 point for the music (John Williams), 1 point for the stunning special effects, 1 point for the fun, 1 point for the art direction and 1 point for the year 69).","6/10"
"AntonioBollo","20 August 2023","This was a perfect movie to complement ""Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse"". I mean everything from the acting, animation, plot, twist/turns and much more was just astonishing. Complements to everyone but specifically Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld. They both do such an amazing job portraying there characters not inly in the first film but somehow manage to do even better on the second. I love the way both Shameik and Hailee along with the animators fill us in on the gap from the first movie to this one, between the transitions and colors.If you are a Spider-Man fan this is a very great film. The great thing about this movie is if you are a fan of Spider-Man you don't necessarily need to watch the first movie to have this one make sense.","10/10"
"antoniotierno","13 January 2024","When Statham's tranquil life-in-retirement is shattered by the death-by-suicide, we start expectedly seeing the usual Jason's character. So he switches into vengeance mode. With beatings, explosions, gunplay and more. It's what happens in a Jason Statham movie. We're talking about genuine crowd-pleaser, action like in a live-action cartoon. No shades of gray here. There is obviously the risk of the whole thing getting and turning into a big cliché, leaving the sensation of a deja-vue. Bit going to much such a movie results in the risk of having to watch such a story, which is properly packed, on the whole.","8/10"

"anupviswanath","25 February 2013","First of all great team work. Made me awe and jealous in a good way. The movie is so true to all elements about India and narrative way was too great, nobody can claim to have made this movie better or best because this is the best of the best. I haven't read the book but the movie has provided me a visual as well as audio treat. Visual treat I don't have to mention(it's known to all who watched this fabulous visual movie) now by audio I meant the score the start itself had traditional Indian music inch by inch but with a new pleasant and at the same time modern in instruments without just using it here and there. The team(visual,sound,actors,directors etc) have provided a new and more spectacular fantasy and dream like movie where in all elements of Hinduism are treated without any mocking sequences. The movie made me think and what I think this movie has conveyed are 1. Life has a meaning and to completely understand it is really hard (Anandi first love but marries another woman) 2. Circle of life comes in where dominant species kills lesser dominant species for survival(hyena kills orangutan and zebra in turn hyena gets killed by Tiger) and man being most dominant is able to train all other animals with his will(Pi training Richard Parker). 3.God works in the most mysterious ways 4.Never give up hope even when the shadows of lose is high. And the final sequence where the tiger just goes into jungle without turning back even though I didn't expect or didn't want it to happen but added meaning to what his father claimed. This movie is worth being called Indian movie because it brings in all our tradition,beliefs,ideas and myths into screen without losing its charm. I congratulate Ang Lee for Visualizing India in the most positive and effective way,each frame showing India was superbly taken and I wish more movies comes out which brings in the values of our nation rather than over hyped and very typical movie like Slum dog millionaire which I hate. And finally I found the ending as somewhat like Inception's ending where the viewer has to determine whether there truly was a Tiger(at the end Tiger goes into jungle and the screen becomes black and white) or just fragments of his imagination to do away with the loneliness or Is he paranoid?Some scenes made me think him as insane(1.When storm comes he pulls away the shelter type clothing and reveal Parker to the extreme weather condtions when he is tied to the boat). Anyway it's upto you viewers to believe in 'GOD' version or 2nd version. I believe in the more colorful story that is 'GOD' version rather than dull boring 2nd story without any color.","10/10"
"Anurag-Shetty","13 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues with the adventures of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore), after the events of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). Miles swings across the Multiverse, where he meets a huge team of Spider-People charged with safeguarding it. When all these various heroes disagree on how to handle a new sinister villain, Miles must dig deep & reinvent what it means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson have given us a movie that not only matches up to the masterpiece that is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), but somehow manages to surpass it. The multiple Easter eggs referencing Spidey's appearances in various forms of media over the years, is absolutely delightful to witness. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. There are many scenes that will make you guffaw uncontrollably. There are many emotional scenes that will tug at your heartstrings & will make you tear up, too. All in all, the perfect ingredients that gives the viewers the best Spider-Man film of all time, even surpassing the superlative Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). The animation is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Kudos to the animators for continually pushing the envelope in the Spider-Verse franchise. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Hailee Steinfeld is outstanding as Gwen Stacy. Brian Tyree Henry is phenomenal as Jeff Morales. Luna Lauren Velez is amazing as Rio Morales. Jake Johnson is awesome as Peter B. Parker. Oscar Isaac is fantastic as Miguel O'Hara. Jason Schwartzman is brilliant as Spot. Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Karan Soni & Shea Whigham are excellent as Jessica Drew, Hobie Brown, Pavitr Prabhakar & George Stacy, respectively. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must watch for Spidey fans & pretty much everyone else. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Eagerly waiting with bated breath for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse(2024)!","9/10"
"Anurag-Shetty","3 December 2012","Life of Pi is about the incredible journey of Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) after he's stranded on a boat with a couple of zoo animals, such as a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena & the most important animal is an adult Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. The story of Pi's life is narrated by an adult Pi(Irrfan Khan). Pi's story begins in Pondicherry where he lived with his mother(Tabu), his father(Adil Hussain) who is a zoo owner & his brother, Ravi(Mohd. Abbas Khaleeli). From here on the story just flows at an incredible pace where you neither get confused nor do you get bored even for a single minute. LOP is a treat to watch even before Pi gets stranded on a boat with all the animals.First off, this is the most visually appealing film of all time! The 3D in this movie is more or less the best 3D I've ever seen. It's even better than Avatar because most of the environment in this movie, is real! Ang Lee has portrayed India beautifully. This movie deserves all the Oscars that it's most probably going to get. A note on the performances. Newcomer Suraj Sharma is brilliant as Pi. The viewer doesn't even realize that he's a newcomer. Irrfan Khan is, as usual, mind blowing as the adult Pi. Tabu is great as Pi's mother. Abbas Khaleeli is impressive as Ravi. The other kid actors who played Pi & Ravi at different stages in their life are spectacular as well. Therefore, Life of Pi is a must watch. I promise you that, it's an experience of a lifetime!","7/10"
"apereztenessa-1","2 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny achieves its goal: to make a true Indiana Jones movie. It is fun, full of action that doesn't feel pulled out of a PowerPoint, and with a story and characters that bring back the spirit of the original films without feeling formatted or repetitive. Not a small feat, and if you love Indiana Jones, I think you will like this installment.A number of critics have mentioned that the film highlights how Indiana Jones is out of his element in the sixties, and they center the film on that feeling. I disagree. While that context is surfaced in the beginning, it's there only to show more strongly how Indiana Jones as a character and hero is almost timeless and how as soon as he puts the hat on, the adventure is back as if time hadn't passed.This is truly the boldest bet of the film: it chooses to believe that an 80-year old Harrison Ford can play the physical action hero again. In that sense, Dial of Destiny is diametrically opposed to Logan (James Mangold's iconic take on a superhero movie) which explored how a superhero aged, and if anything, the film is closer to some Stallone movies such as Rocky V or Rambo, which put forward heroes that rejected their aging.So why this thematic change when Logan worked so well? Because Logan aged its actors, and Dial of Destiny started from an 80-year old Harrison Ford. Depicting the actors' old age, decrepitude, as he took on the role for the last time was not the goal, and would not have been respectful. Right after the initial de-aged scene, a shot shows the body of Harrison Ford coming out of bed, scarcely dressed. It's a shot that was not required, mind you, but that is there intentionally to show the reality of this man, a shot that is there to say to the audience: ""This is what this body is now. Do you want to revel in this sad reality for two hours, or are you willing to dream one last time, and believe this man can be the hero you love?""The choices in the rest of the film all flow from this initial decision. Everything is aimed at creating the illusion that this man can still be a hero in a somewhat credible way. Action scenes primarily in vehicles vs overly physical, dimly lit scenes so that aging is less visible. I believe the bet works, and it was not an easy one to pull off. In a different time, one could have imagined a younger actor reprising the role. I do believe that is possible and it will come, and I will confess I am eager to see a vigorous Indiana Jones on screen again. Until then, Dial of Destiny is a love letter to Harrison Ford and the Indiana Jones that he was, and who filled our dreams as children. And it is a highly enjoyable ride.","7/10"
"appusnikhil","4 February 2024","As usual, it was a weekend and I needed something satisfying to boost my day. There comes Beekeeper. As usual, It's a complete Jason Statham show and David Ayer has gone a bit far in the story by creating a list of exuberant antagonists who will never match the 'Beekeeper's' charisma.The movie was 100 percent satisfying. Well, you shouldn't question the story. Someone new to Jason's movie will be surprised by the massive stuff one man does against an entire army.This is a complete Jason show and he has nailed the role he got. The production design was also great. I do enjoy movies like this where we are completely submerged in the action bit and give no notice to the story or screenplay.","6/10"

I don't know how they do it, but visually Across the Spider-Verse is on another level. There are so many shots that blew my mind. I can't wait to break down this movie frame by frame.

"arabnikita","15 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a deserving conclusion to an epic trilogy. This film in particular solidifies Caesar's place as one of the most interesting characters in film history. From the first film he is constantly going though an internal struggle between his Ape and Human sides and in this movie the weight that is on his shoulders really shows an effect on his spirit. Just to think about the journey he went through from the beginning is awe-inspiring.Andy Serkis might not get an Oscar that he deserves but he has established his place in history as one of the most talented and dedicated actors. Bravo Sir!!!My second nod, actually a bow, goes to Michael Giacchino, the composer of this movie who has done a monumental job with creating the music that takes you on an emotional journey that is the icing of this movie.P.S. One aspect this film does is that it neatly introduces humor in small portions which is used to add some brightness to the struggle that the characters go through. They did not overdo it and I would like to thank you for that.","10/10"

"arauzado","29 June 2023","The essential thing about this film is whether it would answer the questions that fans of this mythical saga wanted to know:
Is it better than the previous installment? Yes it isIs it worth going to see it in the cinema? Yes, its worth itBut if we analyze the film in more depth, it has numerous flaws, which cause the story to stumble: An excessively long prologue, where we are more concerned with believing the rejuvenated CGI face of the character than because of the script, and with a train that seems taken out of cartoons and that we never came to believe.Very well filmed persecutions, but that add unnecessary and forced elements: Why a jilted mafia lover in Morocco?New and old characters that do not contribute anything to the film: Sallah, or the character of Antonio Banderas. And worst of all: Not very well written characters, because they never arouse sympathy in the viewer: And I mean the character of Helena or Teddy, a poorly made copy of Marion and Short round.On the other hand, this film is far from the first trilogy because the total lack of that classic sense of humor that the master Spielberg did have: Each scene ending finished off with a good joke, each response full of wit from Indiana. Here is not in any scene like that.The only good joke in the whole movie is Youre German, dont try to be funny.In short: it's not a bad movie, but it could have been better.","6/10"

Clearly it was directed by someone who was confused if this was Star Wars or Marvel, and the writers were all AI and had no character concept. Typical Disney dribble.That being said, I didn't expect much so the CGI heavy visuals were enjoyable. The plot was predictable and the fact that supervillains were so...breakable.. is just a joke.Overall it's a way to amuse yourself for 2 hours. But when you're watching Disney, don't expect more. Everything they touch is fluffy, soul-less, mind wasting, time passing amusement. It's sad they have control over Marvel.","6/10"
"areatw","6 December 2017","'Life of Pi' is without doubt one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the decade. It is visually mesmerizing, so rich in detail and jawdroppingly realistic. I regret not seeing it at the cinema when it was first released because I think films as visually arresting as this one really need to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.There's more to this film than just CGI and special effects though. The story is just as beautiful as the visuals are and, unlike some of the other CGI heavy films of recent years, it has a plot with substance and characters with depth. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will no doubt watch it again at some point in the future.'Life of Pi' is a beautiful film both inside and out. Cinema doesn't get much better than this.","8/10"
"arfdawg-1","21 January 2018","This is litereally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
The apes talk in a weird stacatto way that is thoroughly annoying.
The plot is miniscule
The direction is horrible and the acting is idiotic.
And after all that -- it's like two and a half hours long!!!!
OMG! Don't waste your time
See the original 1969 POTA and be satisfied. No need to watch any other","2/10"

"arimatic","3 May 2018","Definitely not 9.0 there are so many plot holes ... starlord not waiting for the team to take off thanos gloves before he acted, thanos making light weight of the hulk with one stone but couldn't do that to iron man or even captain America with 5 stones ... after the beginning of the movie we don't see the hulk anymore .dont even mention Thor it seems like everything he learnt in Thor ranarok was forgotten and finally all the ones we disappeared at the end we all know they'll be back because they have movies scheduled for next year.....
 I'm not sure if Disney paid people to rate this movie this high or people turn off their brains before watching this or most people prefer destruction and people punching each other over a good storyline. 6/10 because the visuals were stunning.","9/10"

"aristotelesathanas","25 February 2023","It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!","6/10"
"armagh-97917","16 June 2023","The first movie was great; original, funny, interesting, diverse. This movie is like you when say you like a song, so they play the same song twice as loud hoping you love it twice as much. It more disjointed, the emotions get lost, and really, the ending? In 2 hours and 16 minutes you can bring this movie to at least a temporary conclusion? The villain does not have a good enough back story to carry one, much less two movies. That said some of the spiderverses we see were very creative (especially India-Manhattan mix), and the lead character is as always very likeable. It's like they really didn't much else to say, and then they take too long to say what they did.","4/10"
"Armin_W","31 January 2024","I like a good action movie and I like Jason Statham.However, this story is so ridiculous that at some point it just stops being fun to watch.Anyone who spends money on this film can feel a little like the old lady who was ripped off by the scammers at the beginning.I find that pretty funny after all.Unfortunately, weak scripts are in the majority in the action film genre and really good action films are very rare.I'm a big film fan. However, I haven't gone to the cinema for many years because, for me, most films are simply not worth the price of admission.Action films from the USA are by far the worst because they are usually devoid of any humor. The heroes must always be superheroes, indestructible and invulnerable. That's boring in the long run.","3/10"
"arsalanweb","1 February 2024","""The Beekeeper"" makes a valiant effort to step into the realm of the John Wick universe, but unfortunately, it falls short of capturing the same magic. While the film attempts to emulate the intense action sequences and mysterious underworld, it lacks the finesse and storytelling prowess that made John Wick a cult classic.The plot feels a bit contrived, and the characters don't have the same depth that we've come to expect from this genre. It's clear that the filmmakers were inspired by the success of John Wick, but they struggled to replicate the unique blend of style, choreography, and storytelling that made the original franchise so beloved.However, the saving grace of ""The Beekeeper"" is undeniably Jason and his action figure. Despite the movie's shortcomings, Jason's performance is commendable, and his dedication to the role shines through. The action figure, a nod to his character, is a collector's dream, capturing the essence of the film's attempt at creating a memorable hero.While ""The Beekeeper"" may not reach the heights of the John Wick series, it manages to entertain with its thrilling action sequences and Jason's charismatic portrayal. It's a film worth watching if you're a fan of the genre, and the action figure alone earns it a solid 5 stars in our book.","9/10"

"arsalwise","17 December 2018","This is A Non Spoiler Review
Story 8/10
The story is pretty amazing by dragon ball standards. It is simple yet interesting and well written. The only problem I had was that the story could have been fleshed out more and It also felt like the movie wanted to do more but couldn't because of the limited time and because Toriyama-sensei's script was shrunk from 3 hours to approximately 1hr and 45 Minutes
Art 10/10
Pure sakuga !!!! but CGI seems out of place sometimes(doesnt match the 2d animation). I have seen reviews saying that this style is way too old and seems like an old Ghibli movie but they are stupid, The art is amazing, The camera movement, Its Amazing!!! This is the best piece of work Toei has ever animated and I am not even exaggerating because most Toei's work is pretty....You get my point. (cough cough One Piece,DB Super cough cough)
Sound 9/10
Very Well Composed, Absolutely Amazing! Though the wrestling announcer chants were weird but now they are growing on me after watching the movie 3 times!!! The sound effects for punches and energy blasts were so impactful!
Characters 10/10
The Characters Were amazingly well written and This new broly is amazing! You know that the characters are well written when you like them!
Action 10/10
The fights felt amazing and every punch sent a chill down my spine because of the amazing sound effects!!!Great Camera Work and Wonderful Fight Choreography! The final fight was so quick paced and amazingly animated that my eyes were getting orgasms and couldn't keep up.
Overall 10/10
Great movie with both comedy and excellent action scenes. This animation and story was what the franchise needed!!! Cant wait to see whats next !!!!","10/10"
"art96321","2 June 2023","Wow, what an incredible film. Coming in with high expectations after how great the first film was. The different animations styles of the different types of spider mans as they interact with one another. At times it can seem trippy but it keeps you engage to always keep looking at the spider-man.While the first act is your normal coming of age tale of having to balance being Spider-man and a teenager. Things start becoming fast paced and intense with the story when it gets to the 2nd act of the film.The intensity of the film kept me engage with the action and comedy. Also the storyline is just perfectly written for a multi-verse film for spider-man.With all the references to other media of spider-man, this is the ultimate film for spider-man lovers in all type of media. This film is more than a superhero film but a legitimate movie of the year contender. Top 5 superhero movies for sure.So fun and engaging that you will want more as the film ends.","10/10"
"arthur_tafero","10 January 2023","The very stylish film, The Life of Pi, is one of the finest modern Indian films ever made. It does not rely on silly Bollywood song and dance numbers, nor does it try to portray neorealism in the lives of common Indians (as did the master director, Satrijat Ray). It is a stand-alone film about the fantasies of a young man and his tiger; that's right, every boy should have a pet tiger. This is as different a story as you will ever see on film. The plot is a bit too convoluted to explain, so you really need to see it to understand what is going on. Visually, this film has few competitors; it really is a stunning cinematic experience. Be sure to catch it.","8/10"
"arthuradam","5 May 2018","If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","9/10"

"arungeorge13","30 January 2024","The Beekeeper really is one of those Statham action vehicles where you can laugh at the atrocity of the plot (and its developments) and just tag along for the undemanding ride. Yes, it does feel like a John Wick ripoff staged a bit differently, though director David Ayer knows how to play to Statham's strengths. He's once again a one-man-wrecking-machine, and Ayer exploits that by effectively stylizing the action blocks. Whenever Statham's off-screen, the screenplay (by Kurt Wimmer) carries a made-for-TV feel to it, with random and uninteresting banter between FBI officers. There are bee metaphors galore, and for what it's worth, the entirety of the last act is driven by one of them.Ayer reunites with his Street Kings colleague in DP Gabriel Beristain, who brings in a sense of slickness to the wider, more elaborate shots while also neatly balancing it out in the closer hand-to-hand combat sequences. I think Ayer realised early on that the script didn't offer anything new to engage the audiences, so he decided to keep things as delightfully campy as possible. As a result, we also gets a few moments of dark humour amidst the strictly R-rated action. Josh Hutcherson seems to have had a great time playing the antagonist (a swindling, fintech nepokid), and while he's never a physical match for Statham, the chase remains wholly watchable. For a January release, I guess this did alright.","5/10"
"arunjyotiu","23 December 2012","As I hail from India and the cast and storyline of this film revolves around an Indian family, our traditions and specifically our national animal it appealed to me in the first place than our own Bollywood flicks as well as other English movies.Its my bad that I haven't heard of the name of the novel but as I saw this film I enjoyed it very much due to its AMAZING 3D in the first place. But when I viewed it 2 more times I tried to understand the deep meaning beneath the uncommon name.We all know Pi is an irrational number but without which rationality cannot be achieved as explained in the euclidean geometry. Similarly faith although inexplicable by science but it can be the greatest tool to make impossible possible; quoting the Psalms: ""Trust unto god and He shall direct your path"". A child's innocence has always have been an object of humor to the adults but its the meaning we try to avoid by laughing away. And so Pi Patel's father tries to reason with his young son saying that he sees his own emotions reflected back from the eyes of the tiger. But this is how GOD watches upon all of us, no? Actually the power to do good, to do a miracle lies in all of us. What we lack is the courage and that's why we pray, expect Him to do our work. But fortune always favors the brave and victory loves preparation. Being shipwrecked Pi haven't forgot his trust, faith, belief, courage and above all hope. and these made him survive 227 days in pacific ocean growing a symbiotic relationship with the majestic Bengal tiger for survival or we may say GOD in form of the tiger. But during that time GOD made him see what we yearn to see our whole life: the heavenly beauty of His creation both known and unknown, explored and unexplored and also made him realize not to stop until the goal is achieved for which he escaped the sleeping lady shaped island. So after being landed in the shores of Mexico Pi sought, goodbye from the tiger but its justified why it didn't turn back. GOD is all the time watching us, treading beside us so why would he say goodbye? It finally comes to us what we believe and what we choose to believe. And I will say Yann Martel and Ang Lee has both succeeded in delivering this ultimate message.","8/10"

"asassandroo","26 April 2019","You can not imagine how this movie is going to be good unless you watch it first. It had everything that a movie should have. The visuals and the sounds. However, the Drama factor has played it well this time as in Avengers infinity war.
First it gets you back when Thanos erased 50% of the creatures in the universe. It starts with Barton and his family's being erased ( Clint Barton was not in Infinity war). And then it goes to the story where is Tony stark is stuck in the space with Nebula. And he doesn't know anything about what happened to the earth and if his friends and lovers are still alive. Here when Captain Marvel appears to be the savior and gets him and Nebula safe to the earth.The members of the team that still alive wants to have the infinity stones again to make everything as normal as it was by killing Thanos and get the stones out of his hand. Nebula and Captain Marvel help to find Thanos' spot as it's been not found after he erased the half of the creatures in the universe. They go to where he settles. But before that you can see thanos is really affected with burns over all his body. He goes to his hut and there is a light coming at him with any warning and hits him and Captain Marvel tries to grap him and stable him. The other team are making to get his glove and they do when Thor cuts his hand. Sadly the glove is empty and there was no stones on it. Thanos said that he use the stones to destroy the stones and that is why he gets affected by it which made him inevitable. Thor cuts thanos' head. And the end of the scene where rocket said why did you do that and thor says i went for the head.After 5 years when everyone leaves and having no hope to get everything back. Scott lang (Ant-Man) gets out of the quantum world and get back to the earth after 5 years. He thinks that it is just 5 hours no more. He has no idea what is going on and hardly trying to figure it out. He still has hope for the Avengers to comeback even stronger with his idea of time traveling through the quantum leap that Doc Hank has made.
He successfully made it where everyone accept his theory. They just got the chance to travel the past and get the stones again and use it for the good to the world where eventually they have, but with Thanos' knowning of what is happening. And he tries to make that not to happen by sending The first Nebula to the future and take the stones. Here is a spoiler when Clint and Nat went to get the saul stone they have to sacrifice one of them to get it, it's a dramatic scene when Natasha sacrifices herself for her only family and that's her last wishes.Eventually, they try to use the stones but still there is no one are capable of using it. thor said he is going to do it but he wasn't in a good shape as Tony Stark said. Bruce Banner takes it and puts it in his hand and try to make a flick but he falls down because of the power of the stones. On the other side, Nebula opens the Quantum gap to thanos and his army. Where here the endgame war starts. Acknowledging that everything gets back and everyone is alive again because of The Hulk's flick. The war starts and everyone is back. Thanos vs the avengers. Captain America can lift thor's hammer which is a great scene btw. I don't want to spoil what has happened in this battle. But at last Tony stark take the glove that he made and wears it and flick his finger to erase thanos and his army. And says i... i'm ... iron man and fell down. Where everyone is surrounded him with tears. He peacefully closed his eyes and pepper says you finally can rest now after 10 years of glory and honor.It is a great movie and great ending for Iron Man and the last movie of MUC.","10/10"
"asayed-63121","3 June 2023","This is how a movie featuring multiverse should be.The first thing that one notices in the movie is how they have amped up their animation game. If you think the the animation in the previous installment was great, wait till you set your eyes on this one. With gorgeous colour palettes, each frame can be a wallpaper on your personal dekstop.No Spoilers here, but if you are a spidey-buff you will have fun picking up on the easter eggs. It is plain to see that the makers have a ton of love for the source material. From references to cameos, you will find everything over here.The soundtrack was also amazing. The collection of songs perfectly captured the tone of the film.The plot of the movie is also something that needs to be appreciated. It makes you root for the character and the third half of the film has a twist that you wouldn't see coming. There was a collectible gasp from the audience in the cinema while I watching, as no one expected. Even though there are jokes, it doesn't distract us from the core narrative, which has been the problem with MCU moviesEven though the movie is 2 hours 20 minutes long, the movie passes away like a breeze, you won't find yourself bored or checking your phone. Which is perfect for a commercial superhero flick.","10/10"
"asb_deutsch","16 July 2017","Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the one of the big movie surprises for me of that year. With staggeringly good motion capture for the apes and a touching story of Caesar and Co. it was a classic. What made me not notice that the apes were CGI!Next in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", we are caught in the feelings of man and mammals- though good but took a backward step, making it a little ""dawn"" and more ""war"".Finally, in ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", we get a thought provoking ""emotional"" script than action. The movie goes deep in the characters, especially Caesar.How many trilogies end with a successful second sequel/ third installment? To my perception, only Toy Story 3 and Bourne Ultimatum fits the puzzle. The conclusion is much better than LoTR, The Hobbit (old- fashioned ending) and even The Dark Knight Rises (Incoherent ending; I hope Nolan finds better luck in Dunkirk!). War of the Planet of the Apes with Spider-man: Homecoming can be labeled as June's best popcorn flick- duo. Verdict- A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. If you have a nice narration, you don't need 3D at all, which many people are complaining! My significant digit score: 7.9/10","10/10"

"Ash_Heydrich","19 December 2012","I am an Indian. I watched this in India. With my girlfriend next to me. And we laughed hard throughout the movie because of the horrible Indian accent of all ages of Pi. Thanks to Russell Peters who has actually ruined the Indian accent forever, because lets face it, it is really like that. You can never take a guy who speaks in such accent seriously. ""Richard Parker, I have got water for you, Richard Parker"" I mean mother of god!! Speaking of God, and religion, it's not down everybody else's lane, like I am an Atheist and proudly so, so I found this movie a propaganda for religious fanatics. This Pi guy really should have used pronouns for Richard Parker. Honestly. 227 days out on the sea and still a better love story than twilight, though. Cinematography was awesome of course, watching it in 3D was superb, but its just that. Everything else was a joke. Ang Lee, I'll have what you're smoking.","9/10"
"ashfordofficial","19 April 2023","The film felt underwhelming on a second watch but I still enjoyed the overall experience. As a 100% VFX heavy movie, there's some pretty impressive visual effects and also some questionable effects as well. Unfortunately the script was mediocre with poorly written dialogues that devoid of emotion. The film was unnecessarily too long and slow pacing. Probably another victim of MCU's mandatory 2 hour runtime stipulation. I'm not against the idea, but without a solid script and a creative direction there's nothing else to do that can make a movie entertaining that long. I understand the negative reaction to this movie, even though I liked it. All I can say is that this one is miles better than the trainwreck called, Thor: Love and Thunder.I like Kathryn Newton but I agree her performance was sort of lackadaisical in this movie. In my opinion she delivered a satisfying performance. But I can't say the same about Paul Rudd, his performance was kinda sloppy most of the time. I think the age is catching up to him. Jonathan Majors gave a satisfying performance than his other cast mates. Also it turns out this is probably his first and final portrayal of Kang in an MCU film.","6/10"
"ashfordofficial","20 December 2021","Avengers: Endgame is a depressing and emotional conclusion of the long awaiting Infinity Saga. The final product is not what I had hoped for, but the Russo Brothers created something special that reflex the wholesome of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This film marks the end of an era for some of our beloved characters that we cherished and loved. Going down memory lane is not an easy task, but we sit through 181 minutes to say goodbye to our favorite Avenger. A proper farewell is necessary for Tony Stark and Robert Downey Jr. Because he helped to build this franchise juggernaut that reaping billions at the box office.As the first Avenger and leader of the world's mightiest heroes, Steve Rogers will always be the patron saint of the MCU. Chris Evans helped to shape Captain America as the poster boy for American patriotism and his departure will leave a huge gap and we can hope that his new successor will continue his path of righteousness and compassion.Avengers: Endgame failed Black Widow and she deserves better.","8/10"
"ashleylorraine09","10 August 2023","Okay, so let me start with the fact that Indiana Jones is nostalgic for me. I grew up watching it (at home on vhs, as I wasn't alive for the theater releases). So after crystal skull I was so disappointed. That movie had some fun points but the storyline was awful. I mean aliens? Really?But this movie kept more with history/archaeology which I feel helped a lot.The acting was good, script seemed good, and the action scenes weren't too over the top, yet still fun. The storyline gave you a small bit of heartbreak (if you easily get engrossed into movies) and I also loved the ending. It wrapped up the series and the story of Indiana Jones in a way that I felt did the series justice (Harrison Ford has openly said that this was the final time he would be playing Indiana Jones, prior to the movies release).I felt it was the comeback we needed from Crystal Skull, and I don't think I could have asked for much more considering what we had to work with. The Last Crusade will always be my favorite, but this one gave me ""the feels"".","7/10"
"ashmithnandy","20 January 2024","The movie was good, and I give it 8 out of 10. The movie had really great action in it, brilliant fight scenes. Great work by David Ayer and the rest of the cast and crew. The music was good too. The story was entertaining from the beginning till the end. I was hoping to see more from the movie as I felt the movie short, so I think that the movie could've been longer. It would be great to have a continuation of this story. Jason Statham's character Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper was really like the best, dangerous and most feared characters throughout the whole movie. So at the end, I'm really hoping that the movie gets multiple sequels, and it was a great time watching The Beekeeper. I would surely recommend others to give this movie a watch and love it, as it's the best film of January that has released. If anyone asks me what is the best film to watch in January, then I'd recommend The Beekeeper.","8/10"

Boring story, boring characters and overall just boring... Granted I laughed a few times but for the wrong reasons..

"athanasiosze","2 December 2023","I watched "" Into the Spider-Verse"" last night, it was so much better than i expected. I thought i was too old for this but as it seems, age does not matter when it comes to a good movie. A good movie is a good movie, irregardless of its genre or its targeted audience. So, i decided to watch ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE too.It was orgasmic, non stop action, it was like every second was a different chapter, sort to speak. I am sure that several things went unnoticed and a second view will help. Either way, this was impressive and amazing. Now i will say something that will sound inconsistent and contradictory. I rated 7.5/10 the first movie and 8/10 this movie. I believe that first movie (ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE) is better though. It's more coherent and well structured, even more ""substantial"" i believe. However, i gave ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE a better rating even if it's a bit more flawed. That's because this movie is an achievement. I have a soft spot for overambitious movies, especially when i see that the creators are determined to create a masterpiece. In general, when they go for something different than usual.So, i don't care this is too stuffed, chaotic and messy. There were moments that gave me goosebumbs, there were scenes i felt like a child again watching my favorite scifi/fantasy movies. I've felt nostalgic so i don't care about the flaws. This was an insane experience and the last 30 minutes with all those twists and suspense and the shocking moments were mindblowing.Man, i could never imagine that i would empathize so much with an animation character, being a 45 years old European. Yet, i did. Go get them Miles. I hope the third part of this franchise comes soon.","5/10"

"athirn","11 November 2023","I can't explain why Marvel keeps doing this. The first Ant-Man was a pretty nice sci-fi adventure, but this is a gumpf with no logic, no common sense and a lot of Mary Sue tricks. It's even worse than the fourth Thor, for God's sake! It's like I went to see ""The Lord of the Rings"", but ended up with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" with the entire LoTR cast.You can't do that, Marvel, you just can't. If you want to entertain audiences ages 2 to 8, make something outside the main cinematic universe. Why do well-known heroes have to turn into clowns at a kindergarten matinee?!And stop with the know-it-all teenager nonsense! Stop teaching kids that all you need to get ahead is irresponsibility, and that experience and knowledge are irrelevant.","9/10"
"atleverton","6 August 2023","I think this is a good example of the fact that people do not have a superhero fatigue, they just have a limited tolerance for bad movies. This, along with its predecessor, are probably the greatest Spider-Man films of all time. My favorite actor playing Spider-Man, Toby Maguire, but this film shows a believable teenage boy going through the problems of having great responsibility thrust on him. And the animation is stunning. Not only is it breathtaking, but it's expressive. It's some of the best animation in a feature film since the beginning days of Disney. And by that I don't mean cute princesses, but I mean the Psychedelic horror of some parts of Fantasia, the dancing Pink Elephant sequence in dumbo, and the evil queen sequence in snow White. There's a great scene where Gwen is having an emotional moment with her father and the whole color and tone of the animation changes. There are two major flaws with this film though. The first is the ludicrous idea that somehow what happens to spider-Man in is what keeps the universe together. And the other is the ending. The story feels like it can be concluded with a couple of more scenes, they ended it on a cliffhanger they're going to have a lot of filling and padding to extend the length of the next film. But those are minor things to quibble about, this is a masterpiece, the best superhero movies of all time.","10/10"
"attila-698-252301","21 May 2018","I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? 
Answer: It's not. This film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.","9/10"
"AudioFileZ","4 December 2017","So many thought this should be an epic battle and didn't get it? Obviously that has fueled so much of the negative reviews. What did they expect? Two hours of the first battle which is good, by the way? How would that make a far better film?What we get is the most elaborate CGI in the franchise with a kind of mutated evolution story. It's not like war doesn't bring out some of the worst of humanity. That's nothing to just dismiss. So, we get a fair story of the apes led by Ceasar attempting to balance their own hate and distrust of the remaining humans who still just won't leave them be. Or at least a sizable rogue group of humans are out for blood. True, it's rather simplistic, but think how often interfering using war backfires. It's kind of like ignoring history and blindly attempting to create something that will never be. So, instead of being insulted by the story I say just roll with it. I mean the apes are at the dawning here of mutant bit of humanity where they're just saying leave us be and we'll do the same. When neither side can outright win maybe that's the solution even if the humans take longer to get on board. I guess turning a mirror on some of this old thinking hits people the wrong way when it's grafted onto a sacred movie franchise? This movie isn't trying to make a social statement though because it's just entertainment. Just a story which to some because it's Planet of the Apes is a let down. Get over it.If you're looking for constant violent action scenes I know where you stand. If you're looking for fantastic CGI with some action and an OK story you'll be able to say it's a pretty good flick.","10/10"
"austin0731","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","10/10"
"austincoleman-66971","26 April 2019","The only word I could muster after the screen cut to black was ""Unbelievable.""The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an achievement in film like we've never seen before, and Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of this journey we have been on over the last decade. I genuinely cannot comprehend a more perfect way to end this story along with several character arcs.Endgame takes all of the best things from the previous 21 films and packs them seamlessly into the 3-hour runtime that still somehow leaves you wanting more.
All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).Hours later, I am still mostly speechless. Nothing else I can put into words will be able to do this film justice. You simply have to experience it for yourself.If you're a lifelong Marvel fan, you will swoon over this film. It will touch your heart. It will go down in history. Now stop what you're doing and go experience Avengers: Endgame.","7/10"
"auuwws","15 December 2020","The first aspect was a movie that was very bad until the ship sank. After that, the film greatly improved the tiger in the film. It was scary. The story of the film was interesting. The director of the film was excellent. Acting of young Pi Patel was very bad.","8/10"
"auuwws","26 May 2020","Perhaps Infinity War was the film of Thanos in which he imposed what he was seeking, but Endgame is the movie of Avengers who impose what they seek, and perhaps his title, which translates to ""the end of the game"" means the end of what Thanos sought. But do you think that would be that easy? Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie, nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the long time period for the movie that reached three hours was very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal was neither easy nor many options in front of them.","10/10"

"averagedeveloper","1 February 2024","Disney has now completely lost its way and is destroying and devaluing all the value that Lucasart has. There cannot be such bad management, I now believe that management is done with nepotism instead of merit.I gave the score entirely for the high visuals that money buys. The characters are cliche and mostly hollow. Finding logic in this scenario is harder than looking for a needle in a haystack. If you add a little more plot convenience to the scenario, there will be nothing else left in the movie. Instead of calling it a movie, we could even call it a two and a half hour meaningless action cg-fest. The bad guys of the movie are, of course, Nazis. Please come up with new, more creative historical villains now.Enough is enough, stop destroying all the intellectual value of the brands we love by spending millions of dollars.","7/10"

You'll be captivated.The 3D, considering the subject, is incredibly well done. No mistake at all there. It is mostly invisible, yet it will take you breath away on a number of occasion, and it helps you dive in to this marvelous adventure.Nothing to criticize on this movie, everything is done extremely well. The ""tell me your story"" part is sort of weak and an over used plot strategy, but it works here. The subject matter might not be interesting to all, but it can be enjoyed by all.

"AvionPrince16","16 February 2023","So yeah the movie is pretty classic: a vilain and a hero who will fight. But the quantum space part was pretty interesting: we see also some familiar face from the previous movie. And the vilain Kang was pretty badass and thats great that we know that he will return in the next movies. The reference of Thor was pretty surprising and maybe a cross over for the next time? Maybe. Sound good. So what else to say about the movie? Its still have that comedy side and was pretty funny sometimes. It have some revelations about Janet and when she was in the quantum space and how she met Kang and what she did in the past. It was interesting anyway and it still have some nice special effects. It was pretty good but classic in all the way and will not give anything surprising except that we learnt a little bit more about the mother and Kang the new vilain. But was pretty entertaining anyway. Im still surprised that they put more and more sexual jokes even if its pretty subtle but its there. Nice anyway.","7/10"
"AvionPrince16","28 June 2023","Ok so i saw that Indiana Jones and i need to say that i enjoyed it and found it pretty interesting and entertaining. I found sometimes that the actions scenes was a little bit too long sometimes and even make me forget why there was fighting at the first place. But to be honest if you are looking for a good adventure action movie; go for it. It dont really bring new things or make a revolution but you will see some new faces and some familiar ones and thats pretty great. The story is pretty simple and dont really make things complicate but i had some surprises (like Helena's character, Indiana Jones and his last wish to die with Archimede; yes the treasure hunt will mainly get focused by the research of this man and Helena's father and the comedy at the last scene worked pretty well; i thought they will do like others movies make the hero die in a dramatic way but it just played with us; if it was the death of Indiana Jones like this it will be very pathetic in my opinion and can be feel like a lazy writing; but they didnt do that and they used comedy instead and it was pretty effective im not gonna lie. The part who really annoyed me a little was the moment whe they go back in the past and meet Archimede; it was kind of a sci fi part and didnt really make me thrill at any moment. But it was ok i guess. The actions scenes was very well excecuted: the lights, the fights and the comedy during some parts but pretty classic overall. I enjoyed the treasure hunt, the investigations, the characters, the comedy and the fights. And for that kind of movie and genre its more than enough. I spend a great time anyway. The mention also of the ""nazis"" and ""Hitler"" make us see a historical part and let us know the context to understand it better. Entertaining for sure.","7/10"

"Avwillfan89","18 April 2023","This film is unspeakably bad.It's actually worse than Eternals. Because I didn't care for any of those characters, it didn't bother me as much. Also Chloe Zhao, while being a great director, was simply badly chosen for that kind of film as sci-fi superhero entries are not her strong point.In the case of this, there is absolutely NO excuse for how bad this is. I liked Scott Lang in other films, especially the ensemble ones like Endgame and Civil War. But seeing him in this travesty, where there is no strong development to any of its characters and has one of the weakest plots ever, is truly depressing.Its entire purpose is only to introduce the next big bad guy of the multiverse saga: Kang the Conquerer.Johnathan Majors is probably the best thing about the film, as he really exudes a brooding menace and aggressive physicality. But that's about it.I ACTIVELY despised Cassie Lang in this film. Her character is so annoying, shallow and ridiculously badly written and acted. This is the third time in almost a year that there has been a young character with special abilities or technology whose sole purpose is to move the plot forward and be an inspiration to younger viewers. In the Multiverse of Madness, you had America Chavez, which was actually OK, but you could only kind of get away with it once. The second time with Riri Williams in Wakanda Forever, I was like: Really, again? And then with this, I went: Oh wait, this deliberate goal to create a Mary Sue teenager that promotes activism and surface level inspiration. And is just brilliant at everything she does and never has to learn anything because she is just awesome as she is. Ugh.Also Darren, the villain from the first film, shows up as MODOK as second villain. But then after Cassie simply tells him to ""Stop being a dick."" he... is no longer a villain and now wants to be a hero? That was THE dumbest part of the movie for me. What the hell were they thinking?It's not even worth watching the end-credits, as one has already wasted two hours watching this. I'm glad I didn't waste money in the cinema.Do not bother.","8/10"
"Avwillfan89","24 April 2019","The trailers to this film are completely misleading. It painted a bleak, inevitable outcome for the surviving heroes after Thanos's devastating snap that left the whole universe in ruins.It goes into a completely different direction than I originally expected. For one thing, it's much funnier than I thought.
It's also nothing like Infinity War. It's basically a mix of many other marvel movies all wrapped into one epic heist film.Its lengthy time run does get a bit problematic at times, but by the time the climactic battle sequence comes by the end, you forget all about it. Those who had been disappointed or despondent by Infinity War will rejoice when seeing this one.The film is a true testament to sacrifice, love and loss. Obviously I laughed, I cried and I clapped. This is truly cinematic history.","6/10"
"awesomeguy_92","29 April 2019","I don't know why people are calling it the best Marvel movie till date. Come on guys did you not watched infinity war. To be honest, that was the greatest movie and this was no way near that. It has so many loopholes and extra scenes, I don't know what Russo brothers were thinking. It got lucky just because of all the buildup that the previous movies made, otherwise it would have end up just like justice league.","8/10"
"awsafzidane","2 June 2023","One of the most overwhelming movie experiences of my life. A feast for the visual and auditory senses.I had HUGE expectations from this as the first one is one of my favourite animated movies of all time, and this one even surpassed those!It's one of the longest animated movies of Hollywood, but it doesn't drag for a single moment. There's so much happening in this film, it feels like a miracle that it still works so well! So many different animation styles, such great use of colours that portray the emotions of each scene perfectly, dope soundtrack, countless Easter Eggs; and it still doesn't feel exhausting. So many characters and almost all of them have distinct characteristics. You can sense that the creators have an amazing understanding of the characters, and they do them full justice.But it's not just a compilation of awesome psychedelic animation with some great score, it has a fascinating plot too. It handles the multiverse well, delivers a couple of neat plot twists, while being an emotional coming-of-age story of a couple of teenagers trying to balance their dual lives, and maintaining their relationship with their parents.It's the best Spider-Man film ever made. It's one of the best movies ever made.Now I can't wait for the final film which will establish the Spider-Verse trilogy as one of the greatest trilogies of all time.","10/10"
"awsafzidane","4 May 2023","The writing is painstakingly awful. The story doesn't make much sense. Really bad world building. The humour is very forced and unfunny. The action set pieces are not good enough. Kathryn Newton gives a poor acting performance as Cassie. MODOK might be the most laughably bad villain ever seen on screen. Even the typical big CGI fight at the end was disappointing.The only positive about this film is Jonathan Majors as Kang. He gives a really good performance. The movie picked up after his arrival at around the hour mark, until it fell again during the end fight. Paul Rudd is fine, but not as charming as we expect him to be. Had some good visual ideas, but they were poorly executed due to the abysmal VFX.It's a hodgepodge of Star Wars and Rick and Morty in an MCU film where nothing actually works. Another disappointment from MCU.","6/10"
"axelsson11","8 June 2023","It's incredible and almost crazy how they could top the last movie. Into the spider-verse is a very good movie and is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, and it's crazy for me how they could top that movie and make it even better. The hype made me more interested and i looked even more forward to watch this movie, and my expectations for this movie were really high and i expected that this movie was going to be better than the last one, AND IT DID!The voice actors, animators, plot writers, characters and many more did an incredible work! And let's not forget Metro Boomin did an amazing work with the soundtrack. I listened to the soundtrack before i watched the movie to build up some hype, and i still listen to the soundtrack after the movie and can't stop. The animation is so smooth and satisfying to watch, i love the action packed fighting scenes and the romantic and emotional scenes. The relationship between the characters is insane. I also loved how Gwen got a bigger roll and even got her origin revealed in the beginning (i have not read the comics...). It makes her more important in the movie. And what i experienced, this movie was lightly centered around Gwen and not only Miles, which i LOVED. Gwen is certainly an interesting character. And let's not forget Hobie. An amazing guy and probably the funniest character in the movie. The Spot is a great villain. At first i thought he was not serious and felt like he was just a joke. But later in the movie it completely changed and he got way more powerful, which i loved.I really like Sam Reimi's Spider-Man because of nostalgia and that was a big part of my childhood. And the Tom Holland movies are also good, but not as good as Tobey Maguire's performance. However, the Miles Morales movies is right now, by far, my favorite movie of all time and if not the best Spider Man and superhero movies right now. And if the Beyond the Spider-verse is EVEN better than ITSV and ATSV, it'll be the best trilogy ever. No debate.For me, this movie is a 10/10, but if there is something i should ""complain"" about it's that the audio in the beginning was quite low, or maybe it were something in my cinema that was wrong. Nd the CLIFFHANGER. The ending was great and it wasn't bad to include an cliffhanger, i already knew beforehand that the movie were a part 1. But, the cliffhanger left me speechless and made me obsessed with this movie and for the last 4 days, the movie and the theories haven't left my head since.So do i recommend this movie? OH YES, go watch it! It's worth to watch in cinema, the experience will really make this movie even better. Can't wait to see the next movie!(I Apologize if my english is bad)","10/10"
"axeman_z","19 January 2024","There are lots of action movies that gets released but few that are worth watching. This is one of the ones worth watching. It's not an incredibly deep story/premise, but it is a good story that you wish were real, and yet another film that elevates Jason Statham (again) as the most reliably good action movie star of the last 20+ years. Statham's performance, though never in a scene for extended amounts of time with any one actor save the agent, elevates all their performances for the story. Speaking of the story/mythology, it's as good or better than a certain franchise (looking at you Wick) and yet it probably won't see the endless number of sequels, if it even gets one. I highly suggest you go see the movie in theaters and enjoy it. This is a day one purchase for me when it's home release happens.","6/10"
"ayoreinf","4 June 2023","I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.","6/10"

"Aziz24","10 July 2023","Synopsis: He is now grown up, more mature, and lived with the Spider Man curse for a year. He seems like he is enjoying it, until it gets really dark. Miles Morals returns once again but this time, it's a more powerful enemy that forces Miles to revisit the past and discover the dark and unhidden secrets of the future. He is now in a different ""spot"".Spider Man Across the Spider-Verse created a whole new Spider man experience for every fan. That's with the help of the visuals, using a more unique animation vibe that sets you up with the mood of the film, more characters, and most importantly, the story that has a very deep meaning behind it.Comparing to the animation style used in the first part that sent animation films into another different level, this time the film discovers new and more advanced techniques to set up the perfect mode and tone for the story.The first film dived in Miles Morales' deep character development with the different changes that he went throughout the whole film. As he becomes Spider Man, we see how he goes through all of those changes and how he will adapt to them. As he discovered more about the harshness of being a superhero and the sacrifices he has to make. However, in this film, Miles' character development gets even more tough especially that it sets it up for the third part as well. Miles is not a kid anymore, and the sacrifices he had to make in the first part, are nothing in compare to the ones in the second part. Voice actor Shameik Moore has a huge part in making all of this possible. By just voicing the character, you can feel the anger, fright, or even the sadness and happiness of the character.Speaking of voice actors, Hailee Steinfeld proves herself again as a solid voice actor for Gwen Stacy. Especially that this film focuses more on that character on a deeper level and her relationship with her dad or with her past traumatic experiences. All of that can be seen in the great opening sequence of the film that is in my opinion, the best Spider Man opening sequences and can be considered to be one of the best opening sequences of a super hero film, of course after The Dark Knight's (2008) opening sequence. Daniel Pemberton's music and the animation colors with it's connection to Gwen Stacy and the many easter eggs that have a deeper meaning behind them.Composer Daniel Pemberton has a music piece titled ""Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)"" in the film that can be heard in the opening sequence specifically in which you can clearly tell that it is expressing Gwen's feelings. Especially that it came up in a scene that included a conversation with her dad in a room and the animation & colors on the walls of the room are inspired by water colors and they were dripping down like whenever the conversation between the daughter and the father gets tense or heated. Small details like this are the reason of making this film the greatest animation film SO FAR and the greatest film to tell a Spider Man story.My rating is 9.5/10Watched on June 2nd, 2023
Format: Digital IMAX.","10/10"

"BA_Harrison","12 January 2024","After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel.","7/10"
"BA_Harrison","24 February 2020","War for the Planet of the Apes. Sounds epic, doesn't it? Humans and chimps locked in mortal combat for the supremacy of the planet. Which makes it all the more of a let-down that the majority of this third movie in the rebooted franchise doesn't feature any such action. Most of the film follows chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis) as he makes his way to a human military base where he hopes to take revenge on The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), the man who killed his wife and child.Along the way, Caesar encounters both human and apes, some of whom join him on his travels (including a comedy relief chimp called Bad Ape, and a young mute girl called Nova, a nod towards Linda Harrison's character in the original The Planet of the Apes movie). When Caesar is captured and taken to be tortured in the Colonel's ape work-camp, these new friends help him to escape. Of the 140 minute run-time, only the final 20 minutes or so contain any scenes that could be described as 'war', as a human battalion attacks The Colonel's stronghold; the apes are caught in the crossfire as they try to flee.Judging by the film's current IMDb rating of 7.4, Caesar's emotional journey seems to have satisfied many viewers. Me? I longed for hordes of angry apes on horseback firing machine guns (the best thing about the previous movie), but I was left wanting, my disappointment compounded by the fact that the digital effects for this third film have finally come close to convincing me that the apes are real (the CGI has really improved since 2011) and an all-out inter-species battle could have been something truly spectacular. Oh well, maybe next time.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb (although I very nearly rounded my rating down because -- and you can call me picky, if you like -- I refuse to believe that a horse could support the weight of a fully grown gorilla).","9/10"

It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The finalé, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","10/10"
"BA_Harrison","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens as archaeologist Indiana attempts to wrest the fabled Spear of Longinus from the Nazis. When Indy gets his hands on the artefact, it turns out to be a fake, a worthless reproduction -- ironic, because in the prologue, Jones himself is a reproduction, an unconvincing CGI version of the young Harrison Ford, and the film as a whole is a worthless imitation of the far better films that preceded it (yes even Crystal Skull is better).Incredibly, the digitally de-aged Ford isn't the worst thing about this latest instalment in a franchise that should have hung up its fedora for good after the last debacle.Firstly, the cast is awful. This is a Raiders film, so we have to have Ford on board, but he really is way too old now for this kind of movie -- an octogenarian doing the things he does in this film is laughable. We get Toby Jones as Indy's sidekick in the overlong prologue (there's something about him that really grinds my gears) and Mads Mikkelsen as the villain (what inspired casting -- NOT!), but worst of all are Phoebe Waller-Bridge as horsey heroine Helena, and HER sidekick, a mono-browed teenage pickpocket named Teddy (Ethann Isidore). Thought that Willy and Short Round were kinda irritating? This pair take insufferable to a whole new level.Then there's the not inconsiderable absence of Spielberg behind the camera: he might have messed up with the last Indy film, but with the original trilogy under his belt, it's easy to be a little forgiving of one dud. James Mangold, on the other hand, deserves no such goodwill: he's taken a much loved character and put him in some of the most uninspired action scenes imaginable: say what you want about the 'nuking the fridge' scene, or Mutt swinging with the apes, but at least those were memorable. Dial of Destiny is one forgettable set-piece after another, directed with zero flair (the sloppy editing not helping matters).Now let's consider the script. Indiana Jones does time travel. It's every bit as stupid as Indiana Jones meeting aliens, but somehow it also manages to be incredibly dull and tedious, with none of the sense of wonder and magic that one expects from the franchise. I only watched the film an hour ago and already I'm struggling to recall certain scenes, it's all so unremarkable. There's plenty of predictable fan service, but that only serves to remind the viewer of how much better the original films were. To make matters worse, the whole mess is dragged out to an excruciating two hours and thirty-four minutes.In short, we can add Indiana Jones to the ever growing list of once great franchises that Disney has purchased and then stomped all over. 3/10 -- I wasn't expecting it to be great, but this was worse than I imagined.","7/10"
"bachito1996","14 January 2019","What amazed me most was the story behind what it seems to be the most important point of the plot: the battle between Broly and Goku & Vegeta. The battle is nothing different as we have seen so far, but the story under the mess is pretty interesting. I have to say the first 50 minutes of the movie worthed the cost of the ticket (those minutes, by the way, were without goku and vegeta´s intervention)","9/10"

Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what's To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.","2/10"
"badreligionfan","2 July 2023","What I hated most about this movie is the chase scenes. They are so boring and unrealistic. The story is pretty interesting and the acting of Ford is good as always. I don't like that writers always repeat stuff in sequels that they THINK the fans want to see: Nazis, snakes, gross insect, a smart boy, same old friend, the complete Indiana Jones suit with hat and whip. I'd rather see something new! This may sound weird but after the Trilogy the only two movies for me that had Indiana Jones vibes were the mummy (1999) and the first national treasure movie (2004) because they were new and exiting.","6/10"
"balajtitibor","15 January 2022","An excellent sequel to DB Super. The visuals are the best we've seen so far (just like in the One Piece: Stampede movie), though it has to be said that the fights it was invented in the first place. It expanded the world nicely (for exemple :planet Vampa), and we also learned more about the Saiyan-Frieza relationship and history. It was a good move to get to know Goku's mother Gene, a rethink like Broly Tarzan. We can't have a bad word for music amd The tempo. The dubbing sounds seem to have really enjoyed their role, and the new supporting actors have also been brought in very well. I couldn't imagine Broly without Cheelai and Lemo in the sequel. And the last 40 minutes of the film put the crown on the movie. The fanservice was also stylish, not overdone. It was just time to see the divine figure of Vegita as well. The fights are beautiful, liquid-drawn (i.e., swirling) and the coeography is incredible. There may be so many mouth pulls because the Galic Gun was yellow, and Broly's Super Saiyan Full Power form (Legendary Super Saiyan) was insignificant. It doesn't hurt to let go of the levels of power for this film because it's interesting enough to think that with a simple mortal negligible practice, it can humiliate two people who have surpassed all the gods already. Another mistake is to note that the story is really quite slim, but I think in addition to the many good things the film serves is forgivable. In summary, it comes with a lot of surprises and everything there is to love about Dragon Ball. I can only recommend a mandatory piece.","10/10"
"BallerinaWick","3 September 2023","As an avid Indiana Jones fan, I can say that ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is the right send-off for our beloved archaeologist-adventurer, Indiana Jones. This film masterfully combines the best elements of action, acting, music, screenplay, and direction, paying homage to the iconic character's legacy while delivering a thrilling and emotional conclusion. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Indiana Jones, gives a performance that reminds us why he is the only one who can truly embody this character. His charisma, wit, and undeniable charm shine through, making it abundantly clear that Ford was born to play this role. The chemistry between Ford and his co-stars, including a brilliant Phoebe Waller-Bridge, is amazing, adding depth to the story.The action sequences in ""Dial of Destiny"" are nothing short of spectacular. James Mangold the Director has tried to match the first 3 movies in crafting heart-pounding and inventive action scenes that pay tribute to the classic Indy style while infusing new energy into the franchise. John Williams, the maestro behind the iconic Indiana Jones theme, delivers yet another unforgettable score. His music is not just a soundtrack but a character in itself, heightening the emotional resonance of key moments and elevating the overall cinematic experience.The screenplay, penned with utmost care and respect for the character's history, cleverly weaves together elements from the previous films. It's a love letter to long-time fans, with subtle references and nods that only true Indy aficionados will catch. The story is engaging, filled with unexpected twists and turns, and provides a satisfying narrative arc for our hero. The direction by James Mangold deserves special praise for capturing the essence of the Indiana Jones franchise while pushing the boundaries of what an adventure film can be. The film's visual style is breathtaking, transporting audiences to exotic locations and ancient ruins, all beautifully shot.Critics may argue that the film relies too heavily on nostalgia, but I believe that this is precisely what makes it so special. ""Dial of Destiny"" is a heartfelt farewell to a character who has been a part of our lives for decades. It's a love letter to the fans who have followed Indy's adventures from the very beginning. To those who have grievances with the film, I can only say this: sometimes, our expectations can be so high, and our attachment to a character so strong, that it's challenging for any film to meet them. ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" may not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't need to. It honours the spirit of adventure, archaeology, and heroism that made us fall in love with Indiana Jones in the first place.In conclusion, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is a befitting end to the Indiana Jones saga. It's a film that celebrates the character's enduring legacy, offers a thrilling cinematic experience, and tugs at the heartstrings of fans. It reminds us that, sometimes, a great film doesn't have to redefine a genre; it just needs to remind us why we fell in love with it in the first place. This is an ode to Indiana Jones that fans will cherish for years to come.","8/10"

"BandSAboutMovies","18 February 2023","As a kid, I read and re-read Marvel Premiere #47, which showed how Scott Lang became Ant-Man. Written by David Michelinie and drawn by X-Men team of teams John Byrne and Terry Austin, it was a story I read and re-read and if you have ever seen the way I draw comic books, so much of it comes from this issue.So when it comes to that whole ""Are comics cinema?"" back and forth argument, I think you can figure out what side I'm on. Are there too many comic book movies? Were there too many giallo from 1970-1975? Did Italy make too many Westerns? Were there too many slashers in 1981? Can there be too much of something that you love?Alright, now that I have gotten past the legally required nod to serious criticism, let me tell you why I enjoyed this movie about humanoid broccoli.After the Avengers save everything from Thanos, former criminal and current Avenger Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has settled down from being Ant-Man, instead enjoying life as a writer, husband of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and father of Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), who is upset that her father isn't fighting for people any longer, instead enjoying the fruits of his hard work and resting on his laurels. There's a moment that's interesting here, as she discusses all the people who were displaced in the time where Thanos killed half of reality and now are homeless. Yes, it'd be great to explore this but this is a popcorn movie that soon moves past that; I'm not suggesting a popcorn movie delve into that, but hey, if there ends up being a Disney+ D-Man series that does, I'd watch that. Also, the fact that I just casually namedropped D-Man should explain why I never went to the prom.Anyways, Cassie has been working with her stepmother Hope and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to communicate with the Quantum Realm, the place where Hank's wife Janey Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) spent thirty years of her life and has no interest in going back, particularly when it comes to explaining her past or unleashing new Marvel Cinematic Universe big bad Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors, who is quite frankly amazing in this movie and brings a real sense of big drama to his role, not to mention all the various - oh yeah, SPOILER WARNING, I forgot that legal disclaimer -versions of Kang that he shows off, including Immortus, Rama-Tut, Scarlet Centurion and Victor Timely).Everyone soon gets pulled into that Quantum Realm and becomes part of the war between its inhabitants, with good rebels Jentorra (Katy O'Brian, who was already part of the MCU as Kimball in Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., as well as Major Sarah Grey in the DC superhero TV series Black Lightning and a comms officer on The Mandalorian; if you really want me to go full geek, she's a member of former Micronauts leader Commander Arcturus Rann's Enigma Force alongside other non-Mego owned characters Marionette and Bug; one more semicolon but man, this movie is as close as we're ever getting to a Michael Golden-era Micronauts movie), telepathic Quaz (William Jackson Harper; he's not Quasar, as many Marvel fans thought, but when he does pull a password out of someone's mind at one point, it's 18147, which would be Avengers #181, Scott Lang's first appearance, and a shout out to the aforementioned Marvel Premiere #47), the slime creature with no holes named Veb (David Dastmalchian, who was Kurt in the last two Ant-Man movies, Abra Kadabra on The Flash and Polka Dot Man in Suicide Squad), the flashlight head Xolum (James Cutler) and oh yeah, there's Bill Murray as Lando Calrissian (I kid, he's Lord Krylar, another of the characters like Jentorra who come from K'ai, the microplanet where the Hulk met one of the loves of his life Jarella) battling Kang and his Tron: Legacy-looking soldiers like he's Baron Karza or something.Anyways, yes, this all feels rather like Star Wars but then again isn't Star Wars influenced if not ripped off from Jack Kirby's Fourth World? Kirby invented most of the MCU and rebelling against a dark authority is pretty much an archetype. Where this gets kind of operatic is that Ant-Man is, well, an ant against space god Kang and that's a battle that I never saw coming.I also never thought I'd see MODOK (Machine Organism Designed Only for Killing) in a movie, much less one that fully embraces the absolutely goofy idea of a giant head in a chair with weapons and baby legs. Also, this ends up being former Yellowjacket Darren Cross from the first movie and every time his real face shows up, it breaks the movie but it's a welcome break in the movie.You can imagine - and you'd be right - that the good guys win but this movie brings up an interesting idea that you can't just punch Kang, who lives his life across multiple timelines that are not linear and that this Kang may not be the worst of the many Kangs. Then Scott brushes it off and tries to enjoy some Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake (the fact that the ice cream chain has no tie-in flavor and yet had a Condorman flavor back in the 80s is kind of upsetting).In the same way that politics - nice socialism shoutout with the ants in this - just leads to people not listening to one another, a lot of folks have their minds made up about comic book movies which are really just mythology and should be seen as such. That said, this movie did what all popcorn films should: it entertained me. I think it's hilarious that one of the film's writers, Jeff Loveness, said that this movie is ""Jodorowsky's Dune within Marvel"" and there are not enough drugs in the world to show you what Alejandro Jodorowsky would do with a Marvel film but hey, he also did The Incal in comics form, so when you denigrate comics, keep in mind that a hero of cinema spent so much of his time there.I explained to my wife tonight that as a kid, there I never really wanted to get involved in human drama or how stressful some extended family members could be, so I just filled my life with comic books. Often when we talk on the phone, my mom will say, ""Do you remember this person,"" and the answer is no, I do not remember this person. However, if she asked, ""Was Wolverine really in World War 2?"" I could give her several anecdotes and explain how Black Widow could be young and yet still saved by Logan and Captain America in 1941.So yeah, I liked this movie.","7/10"
"BandSAboutMovies","5 January 2020","Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves wrote this installment, with Reeves returning to direct. Two years after the human-hating Koba attacked humans - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced to fight against Alpha-Omega, a military faction led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), who uses the apes loyal to Koba as his soldiers, calling them donkeys and Caesar's troops kongs.After Disney bought Fox this year, it was thought that this would be the last film in this universe. However, Wes Ball (The Maze Runner) is directing another sequel that is supposedly taking place in the same continuity.This film has way less humans in it - save the Alpha-Omega and army troops that fight one another and the mute Nova, who befriends Maurice. Steve Zahn also shows up as Bad Ape, a chimpanzee who lived in a zoo before the flu outbreak led to the apes moving up the evolutionary ladder.All the apes want to do is find a place in the desert that will be an oasis for them, so that Caesar can raise his sons Blue Eyes and Cornelius in peace. However, getting there will mean going through hell and confronting the past, where Koba had to die. It will cost him a son, a wife and nearly his own life to find the heaven on Earth that the apes deserve. If the goal was for Caesar to become the Moses of the apes, this movie certainly achieves that.After all, Maurice, an orangutan, makes the promise to tell Caesar's story to his son. In the original films, the Lawgiver is responsible for carrying on these traditions, so much so that their statue becomes revered long after Caesar has been forgotten.","1/10"
"bankofmarquis","15 July 2017","I was pleasantly surprised by the first film in this trilogy - RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.  I was also in the minority when I said I was underwhelmed by the 2nd film of this trilogy - DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.  So when I started hearing the glowing reviews of the 3rd installment of this trilogy, I went into the theaters, folded my arms and said - ""prove it"".And...it didn't.Do you see the intense expressions on the characters in the picture above.  That pretty much sums up this film - intense.  This is a SERIOUS film about a SERIOUS subject directed in a SERIOUS manner with SERIOUS performances that takes itself very SERIOUSLY.Much like the DCI Cinematic Universe (prior to WONDER WOMAN), I just wanted to tell the filmmakers to ""lighten up"" a bit.  This is a film about APES taking over the world, after all.  I understand that this is an allegory regarding a suppressed race rising up over their suppressors, but it needn't have been so dark and heavy.A large part of this weight is on the very capable shoulders of Andy Serkis' portrayal of the lead Ape, Caesar.  His motion capture performance is very strong and sets the very dark and serious tone for this film.  I hear calls of ""give this man an Oscar, already!"" and, while I don't quite share their fervor, I will agree that it is a very good, very strong performance.Going toe to toe with Serkis' is Woody Harrelson's equally dark and intense portrayal of Caesar's human advisory - ""THE COLONEL"" - as befits his villain with no name, Harrelson's performance is pretty much one note - all dark and intense - with no nuance whatsoever.  The audience has no problem distinguishing the ""Good Guys"" (or in this case Apes"" and the ""Bad Guys"".And that is where I have the biggest problem with this film.  There is no nuance to it.  The humans are BAD and the apes are GOOD.  No middle ground, no wavering.  So when the ultimate battle is setup, there is no doubt as to outcome, so any real tension is diminished.And that would be my 2nd biggest issue.  This really shouldn't have been called WAR for the Planet of the Apes, for there really wasn't any WAR!  It should have been called INTENSE BROODING LEADING TO A BATTLE on the Planet of the Apes - a battle that wasn't that intense - or interesting.The remaining characters - save one - were generic cannon fodder, devoid of personality or expression - the CGI Ape characters are hidden under emotionless CGI and the Human characters are hidden under emotionless war paint.  I just didn't give a darn about any of them.The one exception is Steve Zahn's motion capture performance as ""Bad Ape"".  Here is a unique looking and sounding character that the Computer artists spent a great deal of time rendering.  His character stands out from the rest and includes HUMOR!  What a welcome relief.As for the CGI in this film, I could tell the filmmakers spent their time ensuring that Caesar and Bad Ape were rendered very well and very realistically - and they were - these characters were outstanding.  But, it looked to me that the filmmakers, then, cut corners elsewhere.  I could ""see the lines"" from time to time, throwing me out of the film and realizing I'm not watching ""real apes"" but a very well drawn, expensive ""cartoon"".  And there was one shot where I said to myself ""that is a cartoon"", it's like the filmmakers put in a tracking, temporary shot (it's a fleeting one) and failed to replace it.Clearly, the filmmakers are setting us up for the remake of the 1968 Charlton Heston classic THE PLANET OF THE APES, for they sprinkle in characters like Cornelius and Nova in this film (and remember, some astronauts went ""missing"" during the first film of this trilogy).  I will faithfully return to the Cineplex to watch that one (I'm a HUGE fan of the original), I just don't think I'll be revisiting this one anytime soon.Bring on Dr. Zaius!Letter Grade:  B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)","8/10"
"bankofmarquis","18 March 2023","The good news for long-time, hard core Marvel Cinematic Universe fans is that the next ""big bad"" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been unleashed and we will now get to see ""Kang The Conqueror"" (in his permutations) battling our heroes for the foreseeable future.The bad news is that for casual fans - and folks that are just plain tired of the MCU - things are going to get more complex and convoluted as the MCU heads deeper into the ""Comic Bookiness"" of their source material.Such is the case with ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA, the 3rd standalone Ant Man film starring Paul Ruud, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas. It is a very ""Comic Bookie"" film in that it takes the audience to the ""Quantum Realm"" and all the quirky characters and locations therein.Director Peyton Reed (who helmed the previous 2 Ant-Man films) leans into this ""Comic Bookieness"" in that he accents the weird and bizarre and creates comic-book-like panels on the images on the screen. Consequently, this makes the film interesting to look at, but for the most part, there is not much substance under the surface.For their part, Ruud, Lilly, Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer (returning from the 2nd Ant-Man film) and newcomer Kathryn Newton (taking over the role of Ruud's daughter, Cassie) are game in what they are asked to work with and react to (mostly to a green screen with CGI filled in later) and they all are winning (enough) presences on screen to spend a very enjoyable time with.Jonathan Majors is on-board as Kang the Conqueror (a version of him was seen at the end of the first season of the Disney+ series LOKI) and he brings his considerable acting chops, gravitas and weight to the proceedings. He is a force to be reckoned with which was apparent from almost the first time he commanded the screen in this film. It will be interesting to see where he takes things from here.The problem with this film is that it is (mostly) style with very little substance. Necessarily, the plot drives a more dramatic, darker theme to this Ant-Man film than in previous outings and the film suffers because of it. One of the charms of the Ant-Man films is that Director Reed was able to lean into the inherent goofiness of Paul Ruud and the absurd idea of him being able to shrink. That quirkiness and sense of fun is gone - as are regular characters played in the past 2 films by the likes of Bobby Canavale, Judy Greer, Randall Park (who has a blink or you'll miss him cameo) and (most egregiously) Michael Pena.What they are replaced by are some quirky ""Quantum Realm"" characters - most of whom are CGI and are voiced by some very good voice performers - it just doesn't hit the same, since the overall theme is darker. Katy M. O'Brian and William Jackson Harper (who is rounding into a very intriguing performer) bring gusto to their roles as a few members of the Quantum realm, which helps pick up the sagginess of this film, but not enough. Not even a Bill Murray appearance can elevate this film to something funner than it is.All in all a ""fine"" entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - and one that will remind you very much that you are watching a film based on Comic Book characters - but it falls squarely in the middle of the MCU entries...a catalogue of which is becoming very deep (maybe too deep), indeed.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","7/10"
"banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024","David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment.","8/10"
"barbagvido","28 November 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a third movie in the new Planet of the Apes prequel series. It's once again directed by Matt Reeves who also directed the previous one and stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson and Steve Zahn as Caesar faces the humans once more.It's a very powerful movie. Very grim, very serious and it absolutely works. Since today almost every blockbuster we get is an action comedy, this felt very refreshing. Just like Dawn, this one has very powerful anti-war themes and some human nature allegories. That's what I love about these prequels. They took a familiar story and focused on its themes more than ever before in order to bring a powerful, emotional story. This one was more emotional than its predecessors, but I liked Dawn of the Planet of the Apes more because the story felt more complete. This one has a mostly pretty good story, but the character of a little girl Nova felt a bit shoehorned in since she served almost no purpose to the plot except showing the effects of a Simian flu on humans and one little bit at the end, but that's it. These may be valid enough reasons for some, but they weren't for me. Also, the pacing sometimes felt a bit off. Like they should have taken more time with the journey around the first half of the movie. It felt really rushed and some emotional moments should have been more of a punch. And then, when we get to this place they were heading for, it really slows down. I liked the Holocaust allegories and all, but as much as the imagery and brutality helped establish some things, the plot didn't go anywhere for a while. I didn't feel these things with Dawn and that's why I thought Dawn was perfect. But these flaws still don't prevent the movie from provoking emotions. This is one of the most emotional blockbusters I've seen. It really reduces the action until the very end and replaces it with a genuine, heartfelt war drama.It's a fitting and epic end to a great trilogy. While only a few flaws make it slightly pale when compared to its predecessor (but it's better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes), it's the most emotional one of the bunch.","10/10"
"barberic-695-574135","17 August 2018","Stupid story line, oh, it could have been so much better. Too much ape dialogue was in sign language, we even considered putting the subtitles on at one point. The SFX is impressive and makes the film watchable but by a thin margin. Technically and logically there is so much wrong with this movie to the point of being ridiculous. Based on the ending, we assume that will be the last Planet of the Apes movie. If this one was the best they can do then it will not be a bad thing. Will we be watching it again, highly unlikely.","7/10"
"barefootstallion","30 January 2024","It was typical Jason Statham fight fare, but it was a lot of fun - it always fun to get to see him reprise his more notable roles like Frank Martin in The Transporter and Lee Christmas in The Expendables.It's a story about a retired special agent from a black-ops organization hitting the revenge trail after some scammers steal everything from the person who was ""the only person who took care of him"" - which led to this friend tragically taking their own life.It was nowhere near as deep or as good as say, The Accountant, it dipping rather blatantly and somewhat shallowly into the contempt we all feel for scammers to fuel its plot, but it was still an enjoyable watch.In other words, while it wasn't very gripping or anything, it is still, always fun to watch Jason Statham be, well, Jason Statham.In summary, this is a movie with which you just get to turn your mind off, munch on some popcorn and just have fun watching it.","10/10"

Then it turns back to a Indy film.First film we had Marion, a tough woman who had charisma and not a know it all character. She was Indy's equal.Second film we had Willie, she didn't know how to fight didn't know how to shoot guns. She was out of her element, and she was fun.This film is way too long. It gets bogged down in many places. Way too much CGI as a very milky feel to it.I felt very depressed after watching this film.

Good chemistry between the family and traditional love.Critiques: Many people will praise Jonathan Majors, but I thought he either talked too slowly or overacted when he was trying to be threatening or angry. He's another generic MCU villain, not a Thanos-level threat. His acting isn't threatening...just the fact that he can and has many copies of himself throughout the multiverse.-M. O. D. O. K. Fans will not be getting what they want from this character. He's a clowned punching bag and looks really bad with the CGI.-Cassie is annoying, mouthy, spoiled, and whinny. She also got typical Hollywood political values and is a girl boss. She looks and acts like a typical Gen-Z Disney actress. All the characters think and say ""She's amazing"" of course.-There is an underlying theme of a socialist revolution where they mock cops, help the rebels, fight the empire, and ""burn it all down.""

"bastille-852-731547","29 June 2023","Modern blockbusters undoubtedly owe plenty of gratitude to Steven Spielberg's first three Indiana Jones films, particularly ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" They helped serve as a prototype for future blockbusters, blending action set pieces with a compelling lead hero, swagger, and a ton of fun. While they sometimes feel very much (often in a good way) of a product of their generation, they still are far more well-made and entertaining than the overwhelming majority of blockbuster sequels today. Unfortunately, the fourth film in the series, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" was rather unsatisfying. Fortunately, this final adventure for Harrison Ford mostly learns from the mistakes of that film, and while it's definitely not on the level of the first two and arguably the third film (how could it be?) it still is an incredibly fun and enjoyable adventure for fans of the series.After a riveting and action-packed prologue, this film is set in 1969 and concerns Indiana Jones' life as a professor. He's increasingly concerned that NASA is willing to hire former Nazis to advise them on aerospace matters. He partners up with his goddaughter Helena to help find a dial that has time travel powers, and prevent it from being placed into the hands of the former Nazis. The plot of ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is not exactly the most original, but even though Spielberg did not direct this installment, the unique trademarks of his films still come out in full force. There's whip-smart pacing and editing, clever line delivery, and an earnest emotional core between Indiana Jones and the people close to him. Despite being dramatically different tonally from James Mangold's earlier blockbuster ""Logan,"" this film actually shares a common theme about what it's like to be a hero looking into a rapidly changing world and worrying about being considered past his prime. The film's action setpieces are well-choreographed, thrilling, and engaging. They provide a sense of excitement and fun, but Mangold wisely makes sure they are never overbearing in relation to establishing a compelling and clever story. This storytelling is accentuated by strong performances. Despite his age (now 80,) Harrison Ford is just as charismatic and provides just a strong performance as Indy as ever. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is also very good as Helena, and Mads Mikkelsen is a creepily effective Nazi. The blend of action, humor, and dramatic stakes is thoroughly balanced over the 2.5 hour runtime, making the film thoroughly entertaining and never feeling tedious or overlong. A great score (John Williams is truly a legend!) and splendid period design of both late-1960s New York City and international locations help make the film more impactful and engaging. While not perfect, this is a highly entertaining blockbuster for those who love this franchise, and I believe that Spielberg would generally be proud of this installment. But above all, it's a great send-off to Harrison Ford in one of his most iconic roles, and a true blast of joy for fans of him as an actor to see him play Indy one last time. Gladly recommended. 7.5/10My ranking of the franchise is: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Last Crusade/Dial of Destiny (tie,) Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.","7/10"
"Bateman_Reviews","12 January 2024","I was going into this with little to no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that everything in this movie was so satisfying. I felt 0 sympathy for any of the villains or scammers in this movie and it was euphoric to see them get their due reckoning. Of course Jason nails it and makes ever kill and brutal take down very satisfyingOne thing I will say is that the lore behind the Bee Keepers was interesting enough to keep my attention though corny with the hive talk at times it works as world building. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of action movies and likes satisfying conclusions.","8/10"

"because-of-him","14 April 2013","The movie is actually a 9.5 out of 10 as far as special effects, but the story plays heavily on religion and is more of a moral teaching that all religions are the same, worthless while at the same time pushes anti- religion. The man who tells the story is a very intelligent person so it is very puzzling why he cannot tell the very marked distinct differences in religions yet finds that he can worship many at the same time, a belief that is beyond belief and believability. The story would have been a perfect 10 had it left out the heavy emphasis on religion because the shipping scenes and survival portions are very believable and beautifully done, almost magical. Overall, the mocking of religion leaves some, as us, with a sense of a thorn in the flesh. While we enjoyed watching it very, very much, it is not a movie we would buy or own. It is just too politically religiously abusive.","7/10"
"beichorndude","18 February 2023","Beign the third installment to the Ant-Man (and the Wasp) franchise I went in having an idea what to expect. Something a little light, tone-wise, but with Kang being introduced I also knew the levity would be moved aside for the weight of the story. All previous characters were pretty close to the previous story's portrayal. Michelle Pfeiffer's role was expanded, which she did great with. Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang filled the role nicely as well, but not quite the same charm as Rudd.I knew that it would be CGI heavy but I felt that made it slightly harder to digest what was going on. Most locations and characters were full of CGI - not that that's a bad thing, but it really made it hard to tell what was happening at time.The story was pretty good. It took a while for it to get to the crux of the problems, but it was a fun ride to get there. . I would have liked a little more backstory on the main villain, but I'm sure we will get more of that as Phase 5 continues.Overall, if you enjoyed the other Ant-Man movies and know that the tone will start getting a little darker, you will enjoy this movie. Just don't expect it to be Civil War or Infinity War.","6/10"
"bekundaedmo","30 January 2024","The movie is phenomenal, the action is top notch, hit me like a surprise, David Ayer I commend you for this movie. At no point did I think the action was little or not interesting enough or that the plot was not good. Am going to have a hard time appreciating other action movies this year because of this movie. Jason Statham is amazing, and I liked how everyone responded when they knew a beekeeper was involved. This movie is one of a kind and if you are an action movie fan and don't like this, well you might not be an action movie fan honestly. The cast were wonderful and fit the movie, the movie was epic.","10/10"
"benderofgender","2 September 2017","The original idea was to symbolize the upcoming race war. The movie was very boring with the monkey's talking in whispers and sign language. Keep watching their lips and sit very close, or you'll miss what they say. Nothing inspiring to make life seem good. The first one was good, but these others just have political messages. The last Planet of the Apes was to try to make you hate guns. If you do see this and get bored, think about the Pizza you can eat when it's over, that would be more inspiring.","10/10"
"benhrkach","9 September 2017","If you walked up to a random person on the street and told them that there was a movie called War for the Planet of the Apes, they might assume that a movie with that title can't be all that great. Well, guess what? It can be. It absolutely can be and I was floored with this film.The performances, the visual effects (which will win the Oscar in early 2018), the story and the cinematography were all so incredible. This film feels and looks real, despite the fact that it's about a group of CGI apes just trying to survive. Each scene was riveting to watch and each one perfectly led into the next one. While many have complained that the title is misleading, it's actually not. There is a war going on between humans and apes and there is a inner war going on in Caesar's mind. It may not be displayed the way that some people wanted it to be, but that's okay. It's still such a beautiful spectacle. Watch the fantastic conclusion to one of the better trilogies in recent years!Grade: 8.4/10","1/10"
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","22 September 2023","Without fail, I have watched wildly successful movies gain sequels that were too big for just one movie. The latest entry in this Trilogy Conundrum is none other than the animated Spider-Verse series. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was a stylish and refreshing animated film that won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Its sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), is equally good in both storytelling and animation. However, the size of such a story being stretched over two films affected some of this movie's pacing.I am increasingly becoming a fan of the ""stylized"" animated movies like Into the Spider-Verse and Across the Spider-Verse. Pixar can show how realistic CGI animation can be, but I found truly creative CGI animation in other studios like this one. This ""cartoony"" style lends itself to the humor of the fight between Miles (Shameik Moore) and Spot (Jason Schwartzman). It's also versatile enough to be serious when it needs to be. If anything, it is able to highlight the visual differences between the different universes.Superfans of the Spider-Man franchise likely got tons of references from decades of Spider-Man iterations. Even if this is your first introduction to the character, it's likely you already know about the ""canon events"" that make up the central theme of this movie. Although it was enjoyable to see Spider-Man in different settings, the film's second half was sluggish as it built up to the next movie's premise. Not knowing where they were going to cut to a ""To Be Continued"" card made the last bit seem endless. Still, I'm excited to watch the last part of this trilogy since the first two parts have been solid.A solid Trilogy Conundrum entry in the Spider-Verse saga, I give Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 4.5 stars out of 5.","9/10"
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","There's something special about the final film in a ""prequel trilogy"" that almost defies explanation. It acts as a springboard to the original content while also tying up all the loose ends that presented themselves in the previous installments of the trilogy. Since the source material is well-known, a viewer can deduce how it will end, but not necessarily how it will get there. In this sense, movies like Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) share a common theme as links between the new and the old.Similar in tone to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), War continues the escalating conflict between the titular apes and the now-endangered humans. Unfortunately, because it places Caesar (Andy Serkis) as the primary protagonist of the whole trilogy, the ""savior"" parallels are a little too heavy-handed here. Heck, they should have titled it Passion of the Planet of the Apes. Still, holding true to the original Planet of the Apes (1968), War almost felt like an homage to another 1960's classic as well: The Great Escape (1963).Of course, while I enjoyed this prequel trilogy and reveled in its impressive computer-generated imagery, it does produce a particular divergence from the original franchise. I haven't seen them in a while, but I'm not sure these rebooted films hold up to the plot continuity of the original ""prequel trilogy"" that was Escape (1972), Conquest (1972), and Battle (1973). Either way, War stands as an excellent end to a reboot series, replete with immediate and long-term foreshadowing that leads people to go back and watch the original Planet of the Apes.A fitting end to a pretty good prequel trilogy, I give War for the Planet of the Apes 4.0 stars out of 5.","3/10"
"benjamincallinicos","15 May 2019","Avengers Endgame had a lot to live up to with Infinity War the previous year being the most successful movie of 2018 and with that shocking ending, it shouldn't have disappointed people. Thankfully it didn't.THIS MOVIE WAS THE GREATEST THREE HOURS OF MY LIFE!It didn't feel like a three-hour slugfest like Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, mind you, there are many elements of Return of the King in the final battle. The story was excellent and really personal and two of our beloved characters were killed off which was really heartbreaking. Both of them sacrifice themselves for their teammates. Black Widow and Tony Stark/Iron Man we have sadly lost and may never see again (The Black Widow movie will be a prequel, by the way.)Yes, you heard right, Marvel Studios had the balls to kill off their biggest character who started it all. Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man. He dies really heroically and the whole shocking event is set really well throughout the movie. He takes the stones from Thanos's gauntlet and uses them against him by saying these awesome words: ""And I... Am... Iron Man!"". The same words he said at the end of his first movie!Another stand-out of the movie is Chris Evans as Captain America. From having him fighting himself from the past, lifting Thor's hammer and getting his shield back at long last. Cap is amazing in this film. I'm going to miss Chris in that role so much. He finally got to say ""Avengers Assemble!"" in this movie and also got a happy ending by living his life with Peggy Carter, growing old and handing over his shield to Sam Wilson. Brilliant moment.That final battle was amazing, seeing every character from the MCU duke it out against Thanos and his army. So many great moments like Cap lifting Mjolnir, Pepper Potts kicking ass as Rescue, Scarlet Witch taking on Thanos and Spider-Man doing his thing.The Russo Brothers really delivered on the action, comedy, emotional weight and the scope of the film. Alan Silvestri's music really makes the movie come alive and that track that plays during Stark's funeral ""The Real Hero"" really makes you burst into tears, it's a beautiful piece that makes the scene flow with emotion. The only things that let movie down is Thor becoming fat and a drunken fool as well as some of the time travel elements being a bit too much but all in all this a great conclusion the Infinity Saga.So, all that's left to do is to say goodbye to this era of the MCU and look to the future which hopefully will start up another amazing story arc as Endgame puts an end to the Infinity Saga. Let's look to the future and see how the MCU carries on being awesome. I still prefer Infinity War as that movie does so many things right but Endgame does deliver as much great fan service as that did. The MCU will continue to expand and I know we are all worried about the future but they'll keep on being badass and amazing with every movie they do.","10/10"
"BenjaminPopkin","30 March 2022","Not my favorite of the trilogy, but definitely an amazing film.That opening scene was even better than the last one. The CGI is the best of the trilogy in this installment for sure. If the last one didn't get Andy Serkis a nomination for an Oscar, then this one certainly should have. Some of his best work ever IMO. They didn't win an Oscar for visual effects either which I honestly find bizarre. This film also has the best music of the trilogy by far.My main issue with the film is that it starts to feel lengthy towards the end and I think they could have cut some things for sure. Also the girl was kind of pointless, she didn't really do anything or add that much, other than showing an emotional side to the apes. But, other than that I had no other real problems. I did get some Logan vibes.I liked the revenge plot and Caesar battling his inner demons. I liked how Caesar offers peace again to humans and it doesn't work out just like the previous time. Could have used more Woody Harrelson. He stole his scenes though. I also totally agreed with his perspective because if it was real we would all be on his side because we are the last of humanity so I could see how he feels the need to wipe out the apes because the law of nature says they will replace the humans. You root for the apes because that's what we're watching but if it was real we would all be team Woody.Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes is an amazing film. The cinematography, music, acting, CGI, and characters are all amazing. Caesar, Maurice, Luca and Rocket are such amazing characters who use such little actual dialogue, yet they can still carry the film so well. Also Bad Ape was really funny and I like that they finally decided to add some form of comedy in the trilogy. I also liked the concept of the zoo ape. The ending of this film is also perfect and definitely a tear jerker. This trilogy was just so well done.The Planet of the Apes trilogy is one of my favorite trilogy's of all time for sure. The character development, storyline, all the visual effects, acting, and emotions that it puts you through is just so amazing. Lengthy but worth it in the long run. If you haven't seen any of these films I suggest you watch them, they are all so great. Now, I'm going to watch the originals.I do think War is the same as Dawn in terms of quality and filmmaking, but overall Dawn is still my favorite of the trilogy. Also, War is a better film than Rise, but I think out of the trilogy and rewatchability that I may like Rise more than War.","9/10"
"benjaminskylerhill","1 June 2023","Today, I saw some of the most inventive, bold, and charming sequences I have ever witnessed on a big screen.Across the Spider-Verse sets up a huge amount of characters and plot devices, and it almost always does so with an astounding amount of grace, power, and wit.The internal conflicts given to Miles and Gwen are compelling, relatable, and emotionally wrenching. The first ten minutes of this movie alone made me feel more than most entire films I've seen all year.This takes the zany, colorful, creative action of the previous film and ups everything; the spectacle is thrilling and fast when it needs to be, but these filmmakers weren't afraid to pull back for small intimate character moments either.Admittedly, the movie does suffer from its need to set everything up for a big finale, as the story's two villains don't get nearly enough time or development to make the threat seem as big as it is. And the cliffhanger ending is, by its nature, unable to provide satisfying payoff for the things it sets up.So here I am, feeling like I just watched the first half of a masterful film, and though I'm not satisfied yet, I anxiously await part two. Because I was all in.","10/10"
"benjaminskylerhill","17 February 2023","Given the sheer gargantuan amount of character backstory and world-building that is stuffed into this latest entry in this decrepit franchise, it's really a miracle that it manages to work as well as it does. It doesn't work great, but it's far from a total failure.Firstly, highest praises must be given to the costumers, production designers, and visual effects artists. They came together and crafted a world in the Quantum Realm that is one of the most visually fascinating and thoroughly detailed I have ever seen put to film.And given that probably 85% of what's ever on-screen in this film was not really physically present, it's miraculous how convincing the world they created really looks, sounds, and feels.As an added praise to these artists, they really picked up the slack where director Payton Reed left it. The way he helms the in-camera scenes-particularly the action-heavy ones-is frustratingly dull, without a single shot feeling like it's anything more than functional.But the sweeping, huge wide shots of action that are entirely CG were largely breathtaking, framing the chaos in gorgeous clarity. I never thought I'd find the Quantum Realm to be such an intriguing setting, but they pulled it off.As for the narrative, there are definitely a couple of rushed character moments that could've used more emotional development, but the relationship between Scott and his daughter Cassie really does give this movie its heart.Their scenes together worked really well as I could feel them yearning for time they had lost and for an understanding they could have built. It largely made up for the sadly underdeveloped and criminally under-utilised villain Kang.Even though he explains his plans and motivations in great, long-winded detail, I still never felt like I understood him. It's all kept incredibly vague, and it made the story's huge stakes hard to care about.As the film neared its end, I was really happy with where it was going. It seemed like they were going for a tragic conclusion to a trilogy that would hit like a gut-punch given the story's parent-child themes.But then the ending really came, and I was disappointed. The film had built up a lot of momentum and was going somewhere really somber and profound, but they were too cowardly to stick the landing.The ending plays it very safe, clumsily wrapping everything up so we don't get too serious with it all.This is a film that I largely enjoyed for its artistic distinction from other MCU films. It could have been great, but it needed tighter focus and it needed commitment to the weighty ideas that it played with.","7/10"
"benjaminskylerhill","30 June 2023","I understand some of the criticisms I've heard surrounding this final Jones outing; it's burdened by a handful of excessively bizarre ideas and an overabundance of characters.But one criticism I'll never understand is that this is somehow disrespectful toward the Indiana Jones character-that it belittles him or mocks him in some way. I could not agree less with this.What I saw today was a film made by a director who understands, respects, and loves this character. He crafted a hearty adventure story that adds depth to Jones and sends him off fondly.Indiana and Helena are characters that are both shown to be capable, intelligent, and protective and they both save each other quite often. They are introduced as closed-off but they wear each others' emotional layers down over the course of the story in subtle, natural ways that really did affect me and make me feel something.The film is shot and directed immaculately-the action is brisk yet hard and thrilling. Sure, the story's ambition requires a LOT of CGI, and it's more noticeable than it should be at times.But that didn't stop me from loving the film because the script is smart, constantly shifting power dynamics and developing character to keep you invested in the world.This is leagues better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I really hope people avoid the hate train that's been building online and give this last adventure a chance in theaters.","6/10"
"BenW1999","1 June 2023","A good film, but very overhyped.A loud gasp of disappointment went across the entire 400+ seated cinema. Many people saying it was ""sh!t"" and ""nothing happened"" and ""that was the deadest film""... and I partially agree.While an overall enjoyable film from my perspective, giving it an 8/10, critics have misled audiences AGAIN and set us up for disappointment. Not much...actually happens.We have a very VERY tedius 30ish minute intro and recap to all the characters we already know about, telling us everything we already know about Gwen and Miles, dragging out the runtime. There's no proper villain in the film either, we get a splatter of a few villains throughout, and one will obviously be a bigger villain in the third film, but... yeah...I sort of agree with the people complaining.I did find this more enjoyable than Guardians of the galaxy Vol 3, but its not the masterpiece 10/10 the paid critics give it.","10/10"

This movie I hope it paid so well he can take a free job for a movie with a real script and real actors. I really understand that Jeremy Irons signed up. At his age in the business, film offers don't grow on trees. This was a low-water mark with lousy acting.

"bevanmortimer","31 January 2013","Life of Pi is one of those films that almost immediately draws you in to the world it has created. I watched the film with a permanent smile on my face and surely that is all you can ask of any film! OK, so we all know the film is about a young man who is cast adrift with a tiger in the Pacific ocean in a small life boat. But, inevitably the story is so much more than that. Told largely in flashback, questions of faith and the human spirit are asked and sometimes answered. Almost uniquely in the day of the big Hollywood blockbusters, the film allows its audience to draw their own conclusions and not to be preached at. I'm sure the film says different things to different people, showing that what you bring in to a film will determine what you take out of it. The cast are excellent, especially the various actors who play our hero Pi Patel through various stages of his life. The different actors are all engaging and make his character believable and likable.The visuals are stunning and some of the 3D adds to the story and doesn't totally detract from it. I'm not a fan of 3D and this is the highest compliment I can pay to any 3D film. But, I think the visuals would be stunning in 2D. To be honest, I wish 3D would go away as it doesn't add very much and is a novelty at best. But, to be fair to director Ang Lee, he used it pretty well.I haven't read the book on which this film is based, so I can't say how true to the book the film is. But, the highest compliment I can pay to the film is it made me want to read the book.All in all a great film that I can highly recommend.","6/10"

"bgsmall","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","10/10"
"bhat-utsav","31 May 2023","A breath of fresh air amidst the horror show that the MCU has devolved into. I'm not sure if it's the constant disappointment from the latest Marvel movie, but this movie was beyond incredible.Another solid storyline, fantastic VA and art work, great soundtrack, and cameos that made me very happy. The addition of Oscar Isaac and Daniel Kaluuya helps elevate the movie further, they've done such a good job. Seeing Miles' relationship with Gwen and Peter be developed further was also great, as they try to balance doing what's good for the multiverse and what's good for Miles.I can't wait to see the next instalment, this is shaping up to be one of the better trilogies in cinema.","10/10"

The acting was phenomenal, the music was so good, and brings so many good jams, and the action and the humor brings you back the first Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.I gotta see these movies again and again, because I would be very excited to see ""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"" if they plan to make it, because Sony has done a marvelous job creating the best animated movies like these beautiful animated Spider-Man movies! Let's go Spider-Man!!!","10/10"
"bhernandez2216","30 June 2023","As a die hard Indiana Jones fan, it was worth a watch and it was pretty fun and entertaining in most parts. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, sure did added a lot of action, and has heart, and also some good classic vibe moments and pretty a little bit of humor, but there are some moments that went pretty shaky and some pretty much funny looking poor CGI effects!I would prefer 3 original Indiana Jones movies along with legendary Harrison Ford who did a really great job playing his legendary Indiana Jones as always, view years later. And Steven Spielberg was an incredible filmmaker, without a doubt. And legendary John Williams with his score was beautiful well done and brings so many good score vibes with his best theme music composing skills that would reveal his music identity!Harrison Ford is at his best as Indiana Jones, and Mads Mikkelsen also did a good job playing the villain, also have to give credits to Karen Allen, Antonio Banderas, and John Rhys-Davies, they did a really good job with there performances, but Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for me on the other hand, I think she ruined the whole movie with her character and other new characters that I do not find entertaining or interesting.I gotta admit, James Mangold who made ""Logan"", ""Ford v Ferrari"", and ""the Wolverine"" did a pretty good job directing it, but Kathleen Kennedy on the other hand, I never trusted her for what she has done over the years, sense she likes to ruin Star Wars and Lucasfilm view years back ever sense! Like she ruined ""The Last Jedi"" and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" those were so incredibly bad! So I despise her for ruining Lucasfilm and I really hope she retires or get fired from Hollywood for good!But like I said, it was worth a watch. So I just wanted to say congratulations to Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, and John Williams for bringing the best moments that was so magical and enjoyable for me. The Adventure... never dies!6/10.","4/10"
"bighead_n_lilarms","22 January 2019","Every single ounce of me absolutely loved this movie. I grew up watching all iterations of DB, and the fact that my two children were about to jump out the seat the same time as their 33 year old pop was, speaks volumes. Just wish it had another 20-40 min of story added on, whether it was to Brolys story, or even the aftermath of the fight. Also a larger release stateside would do wonders I feel like. I feel like a kid again and it feels damn good.","7/10"

"Bill-Metallinos","27 April 2019","The Movie was more like an ""Infinity War Parody"" movie that the Epic Grand Final.Ok, there was an 8 minutes of action at the end, but nothing like the Plot or the action of Infinity War.There was almost nothing to remember from that movie, except the Black Widows death and the final battle while on ""Infinity War"" I can recall so many Epic Moments. There is no need for a second watch.-Thor and Hulk are more like a Parody than the smart fun quotes or people with psychological problems. Both was wasted in the movie.
They could give us some points using B.A.R.F. for Banners/Hulk problems.-Everything was so easy, 2024 Thanos killed just like that, and everything goes so easy.-So Captain America can have the Power of Old-fathers... Why is that? Ok he can hold Mjolnir but where did he find the Odin Force?-Tony Stark build the Time Machine so quickly and so easy, in just 10sec was render and done. And why? Because Ant-man says that he was 5 hours and for you 5 years. To good to be true, it needs more time just to be believed by the audience. It needs more reactions between Stark and Pym Particle and Ant-man to be more realistic.-Too much useless dialogs to put un in the emotional filings of the characters in the first 1,5 hour they could show are how Banner became Professor Hulk, or they can give more screen time in how Stark build the Time machine or the Stark gauntlet. Why Thanos use Uru metall while Stark just use Vibranium. At least they can use the Uru metall from the old destroyed Mjolnir in Norway.-So Thanos Blade can destroy Vibranium Shield (is his Blade from Uru? ) but If the Shield is broken how Older Captain America got his Shield back again in the End?
Lets say, Old Captain America is from an alternate timeline, so how he is in the same timeline with this one? Was there all the time hidden in all Marvel history?
Captain America was 100 but looks like 30, but he age up only 10 years in 70 years with the serum. So going back to '50s and life his life there now he must be 170, so he mush look like 40 years old, and not like 70 years old. (like Bucky, he didn't age at all, all this years). So Captain America live his life in '50s, '60s, '70s, etc till 2024 he show up with Vibranium Shield.
Where did he fund it? is it from an alternate timeline, and how ends up in that Timeline?-So Nebula from 2024 kills Nebula from 2014 but she doesn't get kill or disappear at all. So perhaps she is from an alternate timeline. But Old Captain American isn't from alternate timeline but his Shield is from alternate timeline. Also, every character that enters the Quantum realm should be an alternate timeline of him self... but they aren't.
So why there is alternate timeline in some characters and alternate timeline in some others. Thats Bad script with lot of Plot Holes.-During the movie lots of the times there was a change in history, but the movie didn't show a clue about them. But still they show to us Older Captain America waiting for them near the lake.-There was no surprise in anything, or nothing Epic at all. Nothing memorial. Just and alternate timeline white-out being into the plot of the other movies.
it would be nice if there was a script that will embed all the timeline of the MCU movies and revail how some things really happent.
They just wrote a script and mess up everything with out count on it, just to have another movie.-So, they broke up all the containers of the Infinity stones... How they are going to take them back ? How they will take Space stone back to '50s without the container?
And if it is an alternate timeline, why they should take them back anyway? Who cares about the alternate timeline... certainly not the Script writers of the movie.-So the Mind stone and the Soul Stones stays on 2024, all others goes back to the past. The Space Stone end up to an alternate timeline to Locki. But Thanos never collect the rest of them so Aether is still with the collector and time stone with Strange. Zandar got the Powerstone.
But still none of them change anything in the timeline but is should... just like Old Captain America was there in 2024.
-The big fight in the end was a big mess. There was two big Ant-mans.
When Thanos Spaceship brake down by C.Marvel it destroys all the Water barrier so everyone should be drawn (Strange block up just a small one before that).-So, if Stark gauntlet is part of Stark Armor and made with Friday AI, Why just don't Friday disassemble the gauntlet and fly away when Thanos wears it?
Anyway, there are so many that I can write. hope in the future Marvel will make a Real Timetravel Movie. That wasn't so real, just an alternate timeline timetravel movie with only Old Captain America as 'Timetravel Paradox'.","10/10"
"billcr12","26 October 2017","Woody Harrelson is the Colonel, and he channels Brando's Kurtz from Apocalypse Now,as he has gone off the deep end. After killing Caesar' wife and son, the lead ape is on a mission to settle the score, much like an old Clint Eastwood spaghetti western. Again, as with the previous ape film from 2014, it is much too long at two hours and twenty minutes. Does anyone know the meaning of the word editing? Otherwise, it is the classic battle of good versus evil between Caesar and the colonel. Woody is great, as usual, and Andy Serkis reprises his role from the last Ape movie, and he again equal to the task. The visuals are stunning, and the action non stop. Other than the aforementioned length of the film, if you have some time to kill this is one entertaining ape fest.","4/10"
"billking6666","29 September 2019","Disney really went all out on this and the sequel. Thanos was a character introduced AFTER my time reading marvel Comics. His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.","6/10"
"billmanuel","24 April 2013","I need to forewarn that I went into this movie with high expectations due to the critical review from the industry and the public, and the expectations grew even more after Pi said his story would make his friend, (and by extension me) believe in God. The CGI landscapes, seascapes were beautiful, but the CGI people were not as they looked odd, almost demonic. Still, I was really intrigued now that Pi was claiming that his story would leave me no choice but believe in God, so I kept watching.The story unfolded and there were some exciting scenes, as exciting as can be for a boy and his cat at sea, but even some of the animal CG looked a bit fake. Once the carnivorous island sequence appeared, I knew Pi was disconnected from reality, that it was not merely a case of artistic license. The movie went downhill from here.I waited for the big reveal, the part that would force me to throw off the yoke of agnosticism, change my life forever and finally embrace a higher power. The big reveal, the entire story was an allegory at best, but more accurately a lie to make the truth easier and more profound than it actually was. My takeaway from Pi about believing in God and changing my life forever, God exists if you only pretend he exists and if you are going to pretend, you might as well pretend big and make the lie really grand, truth, honesty, objectivity and logic be damned. So, in that respect I guess I learned more about religion than I cared to.Even worse, the author seems to assume that the public is stupid. At the end when we find out which animal characters represented which human characters, the orangutan being Pi's mother, the zebra being the sailor, the cook being the hyena, Pi's dimwitted friend asks,""but who is the tiger?"" Really? Come on. Pi is like a magical miracle potion that everyone is raving about, but when you actually invest in it and buy it for yourself, you notice the label on the back that says, ""Contents: Oil of Snake"".","4/10"

"billygoat1071","11 January 2013","Life of Pi is a story about a boy who tests his faith and beliefs while being stranded in the middle of the ocean after their ship got sunk by a storm. It's ought to be an inspiring tale to make one believe in God. In the end, there's only few questions to ask, but what made this spectacular is the amazing use of special effects and the direction. You do not always get a film as gorgeous and as highly enjoyable as this one. It's one of the best kinds of experiences you'll get in cinemas. It has real tension, humor, and emotional depth, but the real landmark here is the visuals that are undeniably spellbinding.The beginning is quite intriguing as it talks about faith and its morality, but the conundrum disappointingly ends up being less subtle in execution. Despite of that, we still get to see something extraordinary. One is a genuine fortitude in every suspenseful and emotional moment which practically compels the whole picture. The other is obviously the visuals. Ang Lee interestingly turned the survival into a whimsical and surreal exterior that made this look so remarkable like when the water perfectly reflects the stars in the sky or the lightning struck at the entire ocean during a harsh storm. The CGI-ed animals are amazing how they move and act like real animals. The enjoyable bits is when Pi interacts with those band of misfits. The film is in 3D and yep, there are plenty of things jumped off the screen(noticeably changes ratio aspect in one sequence), but it also shows some interesting use of it.There's only few things to say about this since I haven't read the book(rule breaker here), but I'll say it has the same root of Cloud Atlas. The message isn't overwhelmingly executed but the technical achievements and the direction made it a powerful cinematic experience. It could have been a much better experience if it's strong to its themes, but it's all stunning anyway. Life of Pi is a compelling cinematic journey with endless visual wonders.","5/10"

"BirdzOfParadise","19 February 2023","Let's start with the con, the story. It could have and should have been so much more. They had a great idea, but the writers seemingly lacked the creativity and depth to really take this to its potential. I'm beginning to believe my comic book fan brother who for years has said the MCU is geared toward children as these last two phases for sure just don't seem to tackle their stories with any depth or coherency to them.But the pros...Jonathan Majors not only landed this role but delivered more than I had expected. With different writing I feel even he could have been more but with what he had to work with, he gave us so much...definitely one of the best performances in the MCU. I like this Cassie better than the Endgame Cassie, Altho I hate how the latter learned she wouldn't be returning. And the ants are unsung heroes of this franchise once again.All in all, it was an enjoyable film, worth seeing for sure.","1/10"
"bizzyziggy","1 July 2023","In 1981 I went to a sneak preview of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I saw it several more times at the theater, even staying and watching it again in the same day. I encouraged family and friends to see it. I bought the soundtrack on LP, later CD. I bought the movie on VHS, DVD and currently 4k.This is not my Indiana Jones.The story writing is bad. The direction is awful. Mangold is an overrated director who will never deserve the status of the great directors of yesteryear. And shame on Mangold for repeated lying to the fans about re-shoots and other things that came out of his mouth.Who would think that anything would make me want to increase my rating and rewatch Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This movie does, just as Disney's Star Wars stab elevated the prequel trilogy for everyone.How they dismissed the character of the son Mutt Williams in this movie was yet more poor writing and undeserved.Who would think that Helena would make me appreciate. Willie Scott, a character I despised. Helena does many nonredeemable actions, but is never called on it.Ridiculous thin mustached Teddy is no Short Round. I also have a problem with the teenage character directly involved with the death of a villain, even if he was a Nazi. It just didn't seem right.The whole section in the past, Syracuse, Sicily, just seemed out of place and Dr. Who goofiness.The villain and his number one henchmen don't get the personal Indiana Jones touch that others received in the past. It was like, boom, crash. That's it.It also quite obvious where the original movie ending was heading. I can see it now. Indy in the past and some future artifact found showing what happened to him. Yawn. I would be interested in what some of the unfortunate who saw the original ending have to say. Instead, we get an abrupt ending in the past and the new re-shot story-tale ending unfold.Yes, we get Marion. Which fans always wanted, and it appears she was not in it originally, and also dismissed as another poor writing plot point. I was very happy to see her. And the filmmakers get credit for this last five minute, because it is a feel good moment that viewers are going to resonate with instead of the last 2+ hours.For your sake, pass this by. Oh, and I wasn't paid for this negative review. I actually lost money for the ticket, popcorn and drink.","1/10"
"BJBatimdb","26 December 2012","I haven't read Life of Pi, and feel that being too faithful to the book may have been where screenwriter David Magee went wrong.At its heart it seems to be a simple story - an allegory about a boy and a tiger that masks an horrific experience on board a drifting lifeboat. However, the structure of the piece means that when the truth is finally relayed in the film, all its impact is lost in the confusion of what has gone before. Instead of shock, I felt only irritation that the two-hour allegory had been so unambiguous and had given no hints to the truth which - for maximum effect - should have immediately become apparent in the telling of the second story. So instead of feeling illuminated by the end, I felt cheated and disappointed.Visually it's gorgeous, the acting is first rate, the CGI seamless and the 3D is nice enough, but the movie drags in several places (the mangrove island is just pretty padding) and although the animals portrayed are CGI versions, they are so realistic that I was more upset by the scenes of their slaughter than I was when that was related to the deaths of real people. I would not take a child to see this movie without considering the scenes of animal suffering. Just because they are CGI animals does not make it less traumatic.All in all, a disappointing trip to the movies, where I felt the writer and director lost sight of the most important emotional arc and thereby diminished any impact at the end which would have made up for a rather slow - if beautiful - film.","9/10"
"bkoganbing","13 April 2013","With four people bringing the life of Pi Patel to the big screen, no wonder no Oscars were given out in the Best Acting category. All four seem to function as a unit as the oldest one tells the story of an amazing adventure to a writer who has been told that Pi has an incredible tale to tell. The lack nominations in the acting categories is made up by the four Oscars Life Of Pi won this past year in the technical categories. The computer graphics are something else.Like Gloria Stuart retelling her life as a Titanic survivor and the audience seeing Kate Winslet playing it out on the big screen, Irrfan Khan recounts his surviving a shipwreck where he and his family are taking a bunch of zoo animals from India to Canada where the Japanese freighter they're on is sunk with all hands lost.Young Suraj Sharma manages to swim to a floating and empty lifeboat which turns out not to be so empty as a few of the zoo animals also make it there. Including a young and hungry Bengal Tiger cub who is very hungry. I won't say more because at this point the computer graphic special effects takes over. Some miracles are provided, but maybe the biggest miracle of all is that the tiger and Pi decide they really do need each other. Pi who checked out all forms of religious beliefs calls on all the Deities he's learned on for help. The biggest help granted is if not a change of nature, a curbing of the carnivorous nature of the tiger to save the Life Of Pi.I was kind of lost at the message part, just what director Ang Lee was saying about nature and nature's God to use Jefferson's phrase. But the technical achievements of the film truly do dwarf whatever message that was being told about life. Those achievements have vaulted Life Of Pi to the top of the cinematic world and it's likely to remain there.","10/10"
"blanbrn","6 December 2012","Every once and awhile you have a film that comes along like that of ""Life of Pi"" one that's a tale of courage, wit, determination, and a survival tale it shows that life was worth living as it's often an unexpected and tough unusual journey. Told mostly in flashback form you now have a grown Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan)and Pi recalls the times and days of his India zoo keeper family. And the most life changing and memorable moment that would shape Pi's life is when his family took a ship movement to Canada only to be wrecked by a sea disaster in the Pacific ocean. After the wicked waves of the Pacific have departed Pi's family on the lifeboat he's left with his most notable zoo animals like a zebra, hyena, orangutan and most watched is a fierce growling grown to love Bengal tiger. Along the way this is a cat and mouse game of will and survival for Pi to live it shows that on an unexpected journey skill and wit can be learned for survival. Aside from the film's personal themes of will and determination the special effects are top notch. And any work from award winning director Ang Lee is a story of discovery and love obtaining and ""Life of Pi"" sums up those things. Overall this film is a tribute to courage, wit and the will for survival.","1/10"
"Blashma","1 June 2023","The movie did a great job in the first part and I really enjoyed it so personally I am especially looking forward to the second part and after watching the movie it exceeded my expectations.I love how the film expands its scope and adds more stories to the characters, specifically Gwen (Gwanda), in the new cast I'm super impressed with Oscar Isaac as the voice of Miguel O 'hara , he's been through enough pain to make himself responsible for protecting Spider-Verse and believing himself to be right no matter what . Speaking of Miles, he's really matured in this part, he's just a 15 year old kid who has to balance his Spider-man lifestyle with himself, I like the way Miles tackles problems differently from the rest of Spider-Man . The movie is really fan service, making viewers satisfied with every detail, graphics and family story of Spider-Man.I love every moment of this movie and am looking forward to the sequel, hopefully more Miles and Spider-Verse movies will come out.","10/10"
"blazedounal","18 August 2017","I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me but after seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that the previous films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly good movie. I was incredibly disappointed. The first 10-20 minutes were...pretty good...but then it all went downhill from there and THERE IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes. Not a second more. The third movie is bad.Two years after the U.S. military was called to fight off an increasingly intelligent and dangerous tribe of apes,led by the chimpanzee Caesar, are attacked in the woods by a Alpha-Omega, led by a ruthless Colonel. Alpha-Omega also has in its service apes they call ""donkeys"" that had previously followed Koba (the monkey). During the attack, the Alpha-Omega militants are met by heavy ape resistance, and several soldiers, including a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured by the apes. Caesar arrives and orders the four human soldiers to be released, with a message to the Colonel that he did not start the war, and that he desires peace between the humans and apes. Caesar orders that Red is to be imprisoned for his crimes, but before he can be imprisoned, Red escapes, injuring an albino gorilla named Winter. Soon after, Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his lieutenant Rocket return from a journey to find a safe haven for the apes. They report that they have found a place across the desert that is perfect for the clan. Winter, still frightened from the soldiers' attack, wants to leave immediately, but Caesar does not think they are prepared to leave so soon. That night, a group of Alpha-Omega soldiers, led by the Colonel, infiltrates the apes' home behind a waterfall and the Colonel kills Caesar's wife, Cornelia, and Blue Eyes. Winter cannot be found and he betray the apes.Leaving his younger son, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' mate, Lake, Caesar departs to exact revenge on the Colonel for the death of his family. He is accompanied by some apes, while the other apes head for the desert. During their journey, the apes encounter a soldier living in an abandoned village and Caesar shoots him when he reaches for his rifle. Caesar, Maurice, Luca, and Rocket search the dead soldier's home. Maurice discovers the soldier's daughter who is apparently unable to speak. Maurice befriends and adopts the girl, giving her a small rag doll.Along the way Caesar's party encounters Winter in an Alpha-Omega camp on the beach. He tells Caesar's group that the Colonel has departed for a location referred to as the ""border."" Winter tries to call out to the Alpha-Omega soldiers to save him, but Caesar and the others killing him. Caesar begins to worry that he is becoming like Koba by killing his fellow apes and seeking revenge. While following the soldiers to the border, they discover some soldiers who have been shot and left for dead. Their examination of a soldier who survived reveals that he, like the girl, cannot speak. Later the group meets Bad Ape. Bad Ape reveals that the human soldiers are encamped at the border.When the group arrives at the border, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from an Alpha-Omega patrol, angering Caesar and causing him to proceed alone. Caesar discovers the rest of his ape clan has been captured, and are being forced to build a wall with no food or water; he is captured by Red. The Colonel reveals to Caesar that the Simian Flu virus has mutated and now causes humans who becoming mute and regressing back to a primitive state. Caesar deduces that the Colonel is barricading himself in the facility to fend off remnants of the U.S. Army from the north who are coming to execute him because he favors massacring any infected humans, including his own son, to stop the spread of the virus. Caesar is commended by the Colonel for his intelligence, and the Colonel explains that he is fighting a ""holy war"" for the survival of mankind.While Caesar is in the camp, the mute girl sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To prevent Nova from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive, and confiscates Nova's doll upon discovering it. Together Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel that leads out of the facility. Maurice and Bad Ape use the tunnel to rescue the apes, and Caesar orders the others to escape while he goes to confront the Colonel. As the facility comes under attack by the northern army, Caesar reaches the Colonel. As Caesar is about to kill the Colonel, he realizes that Nova's doll has infected the Colonel with the mutated virus, rendering him unable to speak. Caesar puts down his gun and spares the Colonel, who then uses the gun to commit suicide rather than become a primitive.During the battle between Alpha-Omega and the northern army, the escaping apes come under fire from Alpha-Omega. Caesar attempts to attack Alpha-Omega forces from behind, but is shot with a crossbow by Preacher. Red saves Caesar's life by killing Preacher with a grenade launcher, and is executed by an Alpha-Omega superior as a result. Caesar blows up a large fuel tank, causing a cascade of explosions which destroy the Alpha-Omega facility and allow the northern army to win the battle. However, the army is subsequently devastated by an avalanche, which Caesar and the other apes, carrying Nova, survive by climbing nearby trees.The remaining apes depart the facility and cross the desert to find an oasis. Caesar have his wound and slowly and silently succumbs to his wound and die.","10/10"
"blessmeindeed-28233","22 January 2024","I have seen almost all of Jason Statham's movies. This has to be the best one in my opinion. It was well worth the money.

The plot talks about the current issue of cybercrimes. This is an issue that needs more attention. There were great stunts and some comedy.

"blparker-31738","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","6/10"
"blues9981","31 January 2024","It strikes me as ""buzz-are"" that this film is being marketed as an action thriller when clearly this is an action comedy. It took me about 5 minutes in (when I got to the ""B characters"") to realize these are definitely over the top hysterical archetype villains and I loved every minute. A few scenes just go a wee bit towards slapstick and when it got a little too goofy and loopy, I just kinda went with the flow. If you dug Statham in Crank, you'll dig this one. It was also fun watching Jeremy Irons chew up the scenery with a character just south of Fargo. Take off your thinking cap cause it's a popcorn flick.","8/10"

I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's.

"blueycrter","5 February 2024","There has been a long line of John Wick copy cats e.g. The Wrath of Man and Mr Nobody: i.e. Emotional inciting incident brings professional killer out of retirement to get revenge. With hidden lore and a secret society.This is the worst possible version of those.The inciting incident is contrived, the dialogue between Jason Statham and the old lady feels like they are reading their scripts for the first time. The scamming scene is a little Wolf of Wallstreet cliche, but its probably the best scene in the movie.. then the emotional impact of the lady's death is completely ruined by Jason Statham being surprised by FBI daughter. Also why would the lady kill herself before getting help from her FBI daughter...The rest of the movie is just action action action... but I was yawning throughout. 20 years ago the choreography would be passable, but it isn't doing anything exciting or original. It's not gritty or impressive or believable. It never feels like Statham is ever in danger, or has to put any effort in. About 50 times, a 'bad guy' has a gun aimed at him, and doesn't shoot. Its cliche after cliche. ""Jason Statham ran this way - Freeze!"" turns out it's a different bald man in the same suit. I'd rather be forced to watch every episode of One Piece at 0.25x speed than learn more about beekeeper lore, it's repetitive and doesn't make any sense.In conclusion David Ayer is a bad director who rushed every take, doesn't understand action, has bad taste in music and should consider a new career.... no offense. The producers should cut it down to 2 minutes and use it as a PSA about the dangers of internet scammers.","7/10"
"bob the moo","12 November 2017","Unsurprisingly the third part in this second reboot of the franchise was one of the big films this summer. In being so, it has it deliver in the scale of a blockbuster and in this way it certainly does. The jumps in technology over just the last decade is there on the screen to be seen, and it is consistently impressive regardless of the specifics of the shot. The large battle sequences and wide shots are the obvious examples, but in the close-up and expressions of the main characters is where you will be most impressed with what is possible now.The scale of the technology is one thing, but the other element is the scale of the story. On one hand it is expansive, but on the other it makes it a personal and small in its focus on the two main protagonists. This allows a lot of internal drama to play out, particularly in Caesar. Mostly this works well enough to support the blockbuster and stop it feeling like an expensive video game, but that is not to say that it always manages to make it work. There is conflict, inner turmoil, and some character, but it doesn't transform the film or elevate it significantly above the level of still being a pretty function (and good) blockbuster. Within the writing there is still a lot of convenience, a lot of artificial construction, and many fairly obvious narrative arcs. They all engage and do the job, but they don't stand up to reflection or turn the film into something smarter or deeper. The ending, meanwhile, feels dropped in from a totally different film, but yet obvious and clunky at the same time.As a blockbuster, it has plenty to enjoy and to make it stand out from the pack, but at the same time the epic scale doesn't justify the length, and the content is not as sharp or engaging as it suggests.","10/10"
"bob the moo","2 June 2019","Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.","6/10"
"bob the moo","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","2/10"
"bob the moo","8 June 2014","Life of Pi was one of those books that interested me and was constantly on my mind to read but, being quite a lazy man, I never actually got around to it. The story is one told to an American writer by a man called Pi Patel and it involves a ship wreck where the only survivors are himself and some animals which were also being transported on the ship – the most notable of which is a tiger called Richard Parker. Pi relates his struggle to survive, the things that happened to him and ultimately seeks to make the writer believe in god.Although there is an establishing period early in the film where we discuss god and then also see young Pi and his various religions, the majority of the film occurs once at sea and for most people this is the film they came to see. The posters, the awards and so on all point to this film as a spectacle and to be fair it is. Throughout all the animal sequences it is pretty much never unconvincing; the animals look real and look like they are right there in the same scene. Where bigger sequences occur they are also impressive and technically the whole film looks great. I saw it on 2D on only a television rather than the cinema, but it still worked apart from bits of personal preference – I never like those 1950's style scenes of 'poking audience with stick' – they seem in service of technology than story. Anyway, technically the film works.The problem is that it works too well. It becomes so much about spectacle that we forget all the work in the early part of the film – all that talk about god and ultimately Pi's statement that he will make the writer believe in god. This comes back at the end in a way that is actually quite satisfying because although not as smart as it thinks it is, it does make you think even if it is pretty bleak. The thing is though that this seems stuck on to a special-effects movie, not that a movie about religion had effects in it; so the irony is that the substance of the film really doesn't work as well as it could have done. The need to make the spectacle also means that the film runs much longer than it needed to do if you really were focused on telling the story.It is still a well made project though and the work of all involved is really up there. From the cast, Sharma is great in his first film – convincing in the emotional and physical sides. He is well represented by the older version of his character by Khan (although I did keep hearing his In Treatment character in his slow tone). There are other good performances in here but generally the film is all about Sharma and it is impressive that he isn't lost in the special effects or scale of the scenes. Life of Pi is a film that works best as something that it is not – a big, technically impressive, spectacle. The downside of doing that so well is that it is runs longer than the narrative actually needs and makes it feel like the substance is the thing that is a bit out of place in the film.","10/10"
"bob-rutzel-1","18 March 2013","When the Narrator of the story is in the title, you can be sure the Narrator will not die. Pi (Suraj Sharma) is the Narrator. He and his family are on their way to Canada to sell their family zoo. A storm comes up and wrecks the ship and the only survivors are: Pi, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger (so named Richard Parker due to a cargo manifest order mix-up when the family bought him). Peter Parker was already taken. HA! After the Tiger eats the other animals, Pi decides he needs to teach the Tiger to fish or he will be eaten too. Wait, that's not right. What to do? What to do? Well, there is only one solution left and Pi hopes Richard Parker has enough intelligence to catch on. Now, getting the heavy stuff out of the way, there are 2-stories in here and which will you believe? The mystical one: a tiger and boy on a life boat; or a more believable one where Pi's mother, a seaman, and cook are in the life boat with Pi? Much of this has to do with a belief in God or having faith as the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) unfolds the story to a writer who was told he would believe in God when he heard Pi's story. Okay, good choice. You selected the boy and the tiger. Once they are in the boat together, there is nothing but tension, wariness, anger, fear and really too much suspense. But this never drags. It is like you are Pi and watching out for the tiger every minute of the day and night; and you don't dare rest – and even though we are watching from a comfortable couch, we cannot rest either. We are riveted as is Pi. Yes, there is much CGI in here but everything is so well done, we are still afraid to sleep. We see Pi put together a make-shift raft away from the boat attached with a tether. Now Pi is able to get some restand we try too. We see storms with very high waves, lightning, sharks, whales, flying fish come upon Pi and the tiger and even though Pi, as a very young boy, experimented with Catholicism (even asked to be baptized), and Islam it was the Hindu god Vishnu who he thanked for saving them time and time again. Hey, you go with what you know.The cinematography and photography are simply outstanding. Did you go with what you know when you selected your choice as I asked above? Do you know why the Tiger didn't look back at Pi when they landed on the sand? When you know the answer to that, you then know which story was the true one. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

"bob-the-movie-man","3 May 2019","I will keep this first part of the review short, but add some footnotes (indexed with <#> symbols) to a ""spoiler section"" below the trailer videofurther down. Proceed at your peril if you haven't yet seen it!The MCU has delivered an impressively well-connected movie series. In the case of Thanos, this is a story-arc that started in the mid-credit ""monkey"" at the end of 2012's ""The Avengers"" and, at the conclusion of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", saw half the universe's population drift away - Voldemort-style - into grey ash. This, of course, also wiped out half of our heroes. This included Spider-Man (Tom Holland); Dr Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch); Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman); Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); half of the remaining Guardians; The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr Pym (Michael Douglas). Oblivious to all of this is Ant Man (Paul Rudd), still stranded in the 'quantum realm' following the demise of his colleagues, and with no one to flick the 'return' switch.After some early action, Endgame's story revolves around a desperate attempt by the remaining Avengers, led by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a 'retired' Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) to undo the undoable. Can they succeed against all the odds? (With a new Spider-Man film due out in the summer, I'll give you a guess!). Of more relevance perhaps is whether the team can stay unscathed from their encounter with the scheming and massively powerful Thanos (Josh Brolin)?The film will not be to every fan's taste. After the virtually non-stop rip-roaring action of ""Infinity War"", ""Endgame"" takes a far more contemplative approach to its first hour.The film starts with a devastating prologue, and a great lesson in statistics: that you need a decent sized population to guarantee getting a 50:50 split! There is also a very surprising twist in the first 15 minutes or so that I didn't see coming AT ALL.But then things settle down into a far more sombre section of the film: short on action; long on character development. The world is grieving for its loss, unable to move on past the non-stop counselling sessions that everyone is getting. This first hour was, for me, by far, my favourite part of the film. Seeing how the characters we know and love have been impacted - some for better rather than for worse - was terrific. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk (with a rather glib plot-point) takes on an hilarious new aspect; and Chris Hemsworth adds hugely comedic value as Thor, setting up in Scotland a ""New Asgard"" settlement in uncharacteristically laid-back fashion.As an ensemble cast, everyone plays their parts extremely well. But it is just the breadth of the cast that astounds in this film: just about everyone who is anyone in the Marvel Universe - at least, those who are still alive (alive!) and not dead (dead!) - pop up for an appearance! This is great fun with, in one particular case, the opportunity to try some more rejuvenation of an old timer as previously done with Samuel L. Jackson in ""Captain Marvel"".Inevitably, some of these appearances are overly brief, and characters that I wanted to see developed more in this film (particularly Brie Larson's Captain Marvel) get very little screen time. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) barely get a single line each. So it will depend on where your loyalties lie as to whether you are satisfied with the coverage or not. (I personally find Chris Evans' Captain America a bit of a po-faced bore, so I wasn't keen on the amount of screen time he had).Stan Lee again gets another cameo in the bag before his demise: will this actually be his last live one?Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It could obviously NEVER live up to the over-hyped expectations of the fan base. But as a cinematic spectacle, for me, it delivered on its billing as a blockbuster finale, but one filled with a degree of nuance I was not expecting. The problem with the way that the plot have been structured (no spoilers - <#>) is that it is easy to pick holes in the storyline. Indeed, some dramatic options (that to me seemed obvious ones to 'mine') were left 'unmined' <##>; others were left inexplicably hanging <###>.I suspect the reason for some of this is that the initial cut of this film probably ran to 5 hours rather than the - still bladder-testing - 3 hours as released. There were probably a bunch of scenes left on the cutting room floor that might allow things to make more sense in the extended BluRay release.It's at times slow, but for me never dull. It does suffer from one significant flaw though: the ""Return of the King"" disease. It doesn't know when to quit. There was a natural MCU arc to follow and a perfect time at which to end it: but the directors (the Russo Brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo) kept adding additional scenes that detracted from the natural ending <####>.Above all, unlike I think all but one film in MCU history, there is NO ""MONKEY"" (end-credit scene) in the end credits: either mid-credit or end-credit! So, after the long title crawl (and some rather odd choices for end-title music by Alan Silvestri), if you are not to look bloody stupid as the lights come up, and face a storm of derision from your partner, then leave after the dramatic roll-call sequence of the film's stars!******SPOILER SECTION*****
Do not read beyond this point if you've not watched the film!<#>
The ""plot-hole picking"" business I referenced is of course the time-travelling element of the plot. First up, Stark's discovery of the mobius strip McGuffin is nicely done and his moral torment at disrupting the idyllic life he's built is relatable. But this timey-wimey stuff tends to play havoc with logic.....<##>
The missed opportunity I saw was the killing of Nebula (the younger) by Nebula (the elder) (both Karen Gillan). If it had been the other way round, I *might* have understood it. But surely this way round, Nebula the elder would have ceased to exist to go back in time in the first place? That's obviously a paradox! It would at least have been more satisfying if Nebula the elder had ""ashed"" away or something: literally a self-sacrifice for the greater good. Perhaps I've missed something and need to watch it again!<###>
My other question would be what happened to her sister Gamora? She was alive and kicking (hard) in one scene, but then not mentioned further: just a pining Star Lord (Chris Pratt) looking at her picture? Again, maybe I missed something!What was particularly joyous was seeing a plethora of great faces on the screen: Rene Russo (no immediate relation to the directors!) as Thor's mother; Natalie Portman, reprising her role of Jane Porter from the first Thor films (so brief, it was clearly constructed from cut footage or something); Michael Douglas, old and young, as Dr Pym and particularly Robert Redford. (So THIS, not ""The Old Man and the Gun"", is his ""final film"" then!!?)My previous reservations (from ""Captain Marvel"") about the superior fire-power of Captain Marvel also held true. Although she had ""all the other planets"" around the universe to cater for (""Fair point""), when she did turn up she ripped through Thanos's ship like paper (as she did in her own film). And yet she couldn't rip her way through Thanos? And a stone-less Thanos at that!This really made no sense to me. In ""Infinity War"" you could rationalise that the REASON the combined efforts of The Avengers to attack and remove the glove of Thanos failed was BECAUSE he was immensely powerful by having four of the five stones. In the battle scene in ""Endgame"" he had the better of Stark, Thor, Captain America AND Marvel but without any stones in his possession. Or have I missed something yet again here?<####>
My view of the finale was that it should have ended with the (rather CGI'd) funeral pan round the assembled characters (including a few randoms... I understand the young teen on his own was the kid who helped Stark in ""Iron Man Three""). While the Captain America time travelling piece that followed was sweet and all, it's been done before (in Mel Gibson's ""Forever Young"" for example) and for me wasn't worth the minutes invested in it at the end of an already long film.So, where will we go from here then in the MCU universe? Stan Lee is dead; Stark is dead; Black Widow is dead (though - as Amy Andrews points out, in her excellent review of the movie - she's been criminally underused). There will no doubt be further MCU films: ""SpiderMan: Far From Home"" opens in the summer; surely we are due ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain Marvel"" follow-ups; ; and Ant-Man and the Wasp have barely scratched the surface together. But will we ever get to see another ""Avengers-style"" story arc that traverses and connects the characters again in a similar way? Only the timey-wimey stuff will tell.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)","9/10"
"bobby-schiano","2 February 2024","I'm giving this a 10 because for what it's supposed to be, it's a 10. It's supposed to be an action movie that is fun and enjoyable, and it delivers. Story is decent enough to get you through the movie. Action begins pretty quickly and he kicks butt the entire time. Extremely entertaining movie. It's a classic Statham movie.If anyone gives this a bad review it's because they are idiots. I hate when people eat h a Jason Statham movie expecting some sort of masterpiece or work of art. He delivers an enjoyable, action packed, and entertaining movie almost every time, and this one is no different.","10/10"
"bobireshkov","15 April 2023","I enjoyed Quantumania, it was very visually stunning, the quantum realm looked great, and I like the star wars-type style.Ant man and the Wasp get new suits, they are my favorite suits by far.Cassie also gets a suit, and the new actress Kathryn Newton looks perfect for an older version of Abby Ryder Fortson's portrayal. The only problems i have with Cassie's character is the dialog with Darren and the fact that she can use the suit, but there were no scenes of her learning it.The main role of this film was to introduce Jonathan Majors's Kang, and it was great, he nailed that role. The only problem was that he was't an unstoppable treat, but he will be in Kang's Dynasty. The advanced ants beating Kang makes sense from a writing perspective, it's an Ant man movie after all.Kang not wanting to go and get his part in the probability storm makes sense, he destroys timeliness and he wouldn't want to meet infinite versions of himself there.Darren coming back as Modok was interesting, he was obviously a giant head, which is weird standing next to normal humans, but he looked good, especially during his dead scene, you could really see the well made cgi in his skin and blood. The main thing people are mad about is that Modok wasn't taken seriously, and it is true. The writer himself said that Modok couldn't be serious because of his look, he was simply brought from the dead to die again in this movie,but the way I see it, this doesn't have to be the main Modok. They can still bring him as his own character, they can make him more serious and dark, and in the multiverse everything is possible.I was happy to see a Loki season 2 update in the post credit scene, it's my favorite mcu show at the moment, I am happy that there is more ov it coming soon.The council of Kangs was unexpected for me, it was a great post credit scene, that makes me wonder, who will be the main Kang? I know it will be Jonathan Majors, but I am not sure if it will be the same Kang or a slightly different version.Overall, I think this is a good stats to phase 5, and I really enjoyed the movie.The only things they could change, in my opinion, is adding more scenes of Cassie training with the suit, more scenes of bonding time between Hank Pym,Hope and Cassie, and maybe more action of Modok.","3/10"
"boblipton","11 June 2023","Before I begin my review, WARNING! This is the first of a two-part movie. I don't mind two-parters, but I do resent finding out at the end.That said, when we begin this movie, we discover Miles Morales down in the dumps. True, he has just saved the multiverse, but he's a lonely neighborhood Spiderman, with his fellow spidermen (and women) off in their own versions of the Earth. However, when a villain called the Spot shows up, proclaiming himself Spiderman's nemesis, taking umbrage at being called the villain of the week, and Gwen Stacey's Spiderwoman shows up, Miles finds himself tagging along to discover a multiverse of Spidermen, Spiderwoman, Spidercats, Spiderbabies, and even a Spider Tyrannosaurus Rex, banded together to defend all reality.... and he's not welcome.Once again there are clever gags, every universe is drawn in a different style, and there is a clear metaphorical meaning to this: events may compel us into certain paths, making us seem no more than an expression of a trope, but who we are makes a difference in the outcome, too. The visual splendor of this movie makes it one you should see, if you are interested, in the theater. Even though I am annoyed at having a two-parter slipped past me without warning.","8/10"
"boblipton","9 July 2023","I had a great time looking at this movie, until I started to think about it and what it meant. Here's 81-year-old Harrison Ford portraying 65-year-old Indiana Jones in feats of derring-do that would have put me in the hospital, if I was lucky, at 30. The movie was preceded by coming attractions of movies that feature 70-year-old Liam Neeson taking on a maniac who has planted bombs everywhere, and sixty-two year old Tom Cruise saving the world and his wife by running very fast and jumping a motorcycle off a cliff, even though the mission is impossible.I am old enough to remember when Clark Gable did his own stunts in THE MISFITS, and promptly died of a heart attack. He was fifty-nine when he died. It's certainly true that people can keep active and healthy and relatively youthful looking longer than they used to. Neither do I expect any sensible movie star to say ""Certainly I am fit and quite able to do this, but keep your tens of millions of dollars, Mr. Producer."" Likewise, the movie industry hasn't come up with much in the way of fresh ideas since W. K. L. Dickson directed BLACKSMITH SCENE in 1893. Nor should they. Their job is to take hundreds of millions of dollars, shepherd them through the movie-making process like Oscar Meyer moving cow parts through the frankfurter-making process, and come out with something north of however much moolah went in. Since at least 1893, audiences have demonstrated time and again that originality serves little to no purpose in the effort. The wise producer has taken heed.And so, men -- and women, since Jane Fonda has been forced from retirement -- who should be spending their golden years enjoying their well-earned leisure, or engaging in roles that reflect the wisdom and dignity, and even problems that used to accrue to our elders to so do -- continue to pretend to run fast, get shot, and bounce back like rubber balls. And why do they do it? Because the producers keep offering them absurd sums of money. And the producers do that because we, the movie-going public, insist on it. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proven himself a smart and wise enough guy to get himself elected governor of California, and remains a voice of reason, passion, compassion, and love of democracy in our often fraught times. Yet he's still in demand in the movies, but only as a cigar-chomping tough guy toting a machine gun like it's a pea shooter and intoning ""I'll be back.""He shouldn't have to. He only does it because many people, my age and younger, refuse to admit that we're getting older, and it's time to put away the juvenile fantasies that amused us when we were fourteen. Haven't we grown tired of sniggering at the same things over and over again? Haven't we grown up at all? Don't new problems and pleasures occupy us, or did we cease to grow more than half a century ago? Must the same people put on the same costumes and perform the same roles yet again, because we insist on being adolescents until they drag all our corpses from our Assisted Living facilities and dispose of the remains in whatever fashion is fashionable?No, this is a very enjoyable movie. But until we, the movie-watching public decide to grow up, neither will the movies.","6/10"
"BoBo_Goal32","8 February 2024","Jason Statham is...the beekeeper! No sharks this time. Just bees. Like Liam Neeson, just younger, better lucking and still fit. This movie is going nowhere, but somehow, someway, turns out to be pretty entertaining. The first third of it is like a bad joke with characteristic characters.Still it manages to go through to the next level, where the characters stay stupid, the plot stays dumb, but the action is on high volume. Emmy Raver-Lampman and Bobby Naderi can easily get into the Razzies of this year with ridiculous performances and their part of the written script is just a perfect example for bad writing.No feelings or interest for any of those supporting characters and if we can say the truth - none of those for the main character. But still, as his prime action movies of the beginning, Jason Statham manages to keep consistency with good performance and the movie is pulling through with good action sequences.David Ayer made some good (and bad) movies before. He knows exactly what is needed for the audience to keep his eyes on the screen and he pulls it of once again, without any hard work. The writing is not good, but the stars of this movie gives him larger weight with good side performances.I am talking about Jeremy Irons, On a small and significant role And also about Josh Hutcherson, as the villain of the movie, which is doing good job. Through some of the stages of the beginning it seemed that this one is going to be really bad, but sometime, along the way, it got better and this is what is burnt in our consciousness at the end.","9/10"

"boothkaren20","7 January 2013","I found this film ultimately unsatisfying. Granted, it is visually stunning, but that in itself doesn't justify the running time. I found myself wondering what the point of the film was at all. If I'm right,it is a pseudo mystical / philosophical propaganda piece, which suggests that it is better to hold tight to a fantastical, improbable story of triumph over adversity (ie your faith in God, whoever that is), if it gives you hope and gets you through life – rather than to endure a harsh, unpalatable reality. The whole film is geared up to asking the question of the viewer – which do you prefer, the outlandish fantasy or the grim truth? I'm not sure it's even answerable, unless you have a faith which you want to reaffirm. So when the question came, I thought ""Is that it? Is that what you've been waiting to pose""? The majority of the film covers a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck, cast away on a small lifeboat in the company of a Bengal tiger. The story is told in retrospective by the boy (Pi) as an adult. It is clear to the viewer that this is a tall tale, from Pi's general style of story telling (a colourful childhood, an eccentric swimming-obsessed uncle). We can tell that his style is somewhat unreliable. Therefore I didn't exactly buy into the survival story. I wasn't rooting for him and there was no emotional attachment to the character, in the way there would have been if this was a straight forward recounting of what happened. What I was thinking was ""when is this part going to end, so that I can get on with finding out what's really going on in the film""? By that, I don't mean that I was particularly interested in the true survival story, which when it came was pretty grim (although that might have been a more interesting film!). I really wanted to know why the film maker thought it was so important to take us on this fantastical journey. When the answer came, in all its semi-philosophical shallowness, it wasn't worth the wait.","9/10"
"bora_mustafa","28 April 2018","I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.","2/10"
"Bored_Dragon","13 November 2018","Technically and visually the movie is almost perfect. I believe it would leave me breathless if I saw it in the cinema. But the story itself, although very well-written, didn't excite me. The essence is touching and tragic in its truthfulness, but in my opinion, it is not presented in a sufficiently impressive way. Woody Harrelson masterfully played the role of the main ""villain"" and made me hate him with my whole being, despite the fact that he is one of my favorite actors.8/10","10/10"
"Boris-Sh","9 August 2019","A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans.
So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important.
Just enjoy!","9/10"
"Boristhemoggy","31 January 2024","Jason Statham is Adam Clay, a former secretive ops agent (retired) who is dragged back into action by heartless cyber scammers who attack his friend.Jason is the only real action hero worth watching at this moment in time. You can call him cheesy and corny and indeed he is but he does it so perfectly you don't care.Some of the dialogue would be laughable in other films, some of the scenes would be classed as unrealistic in other films, and happily there's not a gun involved with unlimited magazine. :)
There's plot holes galore and some very questionable scenes and yet...this film is fabulous. I loved it and sat without moving from start to finish.Statham has that electrifying presence that makes you forced to watch him and in any other hands this film would have been a porker. But Statham safely guides us through moral righteousness, revenge, justice and a very relevant criminal committing cyber scams is his ultimate target.Entirely watchable, entirely enjoyable, The best action film in a while bar none!","7/10"
"bosullivan2-719-143250","28 June 2023","Delighted to see Indy on the big screen again and have the chance to take my kids to see such an iconic legend. It's great fun. A bit long, maybe scary for kids in places (but exactly what you want from an Indiana Jones movie!) and IMO ending pays off with a big surprise. (Go see it before someone who doesn't like it ruins it for you!)The movie starts off great. There's a bit of uncanny valley with the de-aging, but the scene itself is so much fun and classic Indy back fighting Nazi's and you know it's Harrison Ford for real, which makes it so much more powerful.Once we jump forward we see an older Indy now forced to face the new age of the moon landing and space fanatics. He's tired, grumpy and fed-up with life. What's there to live for? Well thank God there's another adventure around the corner waiting for him! Phoebe waller-bridge is the new sidekick for Indy who sets everything in motion. No one is ever going to beat Sean Connery in that role, but Phoebe does her best and you believe their relationship for the most part. It's not perfect, their banter isn't hilariously funny and emotional, but it does not ruin the movie, and Phoebe is a perfectly well equipped actor to keep up with Harrison and join in on the action. (Ignore the haters. She is not as annoying or over bearing as they make out.)The new bad guys led by Casino Royal's Mads Mikkelsen and ruthless henchman Boyd Holbrook from Logan, are ferocious brutal killers, in the most horrible sense. They shoot innocent people in cold blood too often for my liking in a family adventure movie, but are worthy foes for Indy to battle against, and you do find yourself on the edge of your seat when Indy is on the run from them or fighting them.This is where some people may have gripes with the film, which is Indy can't physically take them on, due to his age, so just runs away instead or chases them in a car, but then he's no problem jumping from cars to horses to gain the upper hand, which is fine, Harrison is magnificent, but if we're going to play the age card, I'd like to see Indy outwit the bad guys too with his book-smarts & experience, trapping the bad guys in a cave full of skeletons or spiders, if even just to slow them down, without changing the overall outcome.Nonetheless, Indy's last action adventure is a whip roaring one from start to finish. It's incredible to see Harrison donning the famous fedora again, taking on Nazi's and exploring creepy caves and getting himself in way over his head, as always! It's not Raiders or Last Crusade. Definitely not Kingdom. Just a great mad new adventure. To be enjoyed on the big screen with the amazing John William's score that's guaranteed to get you in the mood for another spine tingling adventure.","5/10"
"botev1921","1 May 2019","Don't get me wrong, the movie is actually solid in terms of acting and special effects, being it way too long. The big issue here is that 'Infinity War' raised the bar so high, this is just an unworthy sequel. In three hours of movie, you actually get some credible story for no more than 10 minutes. The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained! I would not watch this again, probably never, unlike 'Infinity War'.","10/10"
"bowotrahutomo","18 February 2023","The rhythm of the story is a bit slow, but it is full of light messages of Family Love, Moral Messages Good and open communication in the relationship between parents and children who must be intimate, trust each other and support each other in times of trouble.Family is everything. The rest, unfortunately the story phase is rather slow and boring. Fortunately, there are funny scenes typical of Ant-Man films and antagonist characterizations that make you laugh.This film cures our longing for the Avengers superhero character. There's a cameo wanting to portray Stan Lee's character; this part of the buying coffee scene is a light but punchy touch of comedy about people's perceptions of Ant-Man.","7/10"

"Br4ve-trave1or","31 January 2024","I've always wondered why no one wrote a 'John Wick' type franchise for Stratham and this movie could be it. Comparing it to John Wicks first introduction, I'd say I was insanely more captivated throughout this WHOLE movie. Simple plot BUT with a great concept. It seems in the beginning its just going to be a fun revenge film and it was, but not simplisticly so.The Hive can be explored even further with a sequel and more if Hollywood is smart. I don't believe any studio has lost money with Strathem at the helm and his last franchise movies were so long ago. And personally, I prefer old hard men in these roles Ala Keanue Reeves.","10/10"
"braddugg","24 November 2012","A silly dumb adventure that sails on sea for most part and left me with seasickness.At the end of the movie, I was hearing claps in the theatre and I was wondering what have they liked so much in the film because I did not like anything. Yes, the visual effects were good, but nowhere near a movie like JURASSIC PARK. Don't even compare with AVATAR please. The plot, oh, where is the plot, a boy gets lost in a sea because of a thunderstorm and he takes a trip with a tiger and for the good part of it, both are struck together in sea. The episode was too long for me and just made me feel like it's giving me seasickness. Now, where did it go wrong? If I may say so, then in the writing itself that does not involve audience much. That is, it did not do anything to me. It neither thrilled me nor moved me nor made me laugh out loud. It went on and on and got me drowsy by the end. The only good thing is special effects that are good, but I am sure many movies in recent past have come with better effects and better ideas. Hailed by many as one of the best films of this year, I would rather say, it's a boring adventure. It is good for the first half hour or even an hour I would say, but after that it goes on and on and the sad part is it has inevitable end. It's not a kind of movie that could have ended anyway, the adventure has to end and the boy has to grow and the big Pi (Irrfan Khan) is going to tell this to his friend. Hey, now there is a twist, he tells this adventure and he tells a believable story while normal people stick to his believable story, his writer friend likes the adventure. So I as audience, had to give in to something and I was rather interested in the story he told than this adventure. The best moments are done in the first half an hour itself with Pi and his family in Pondicherry, once he gets on a ship, and gets lost, it stays for sometime, but man, those jelly fish, those whales, even that royal Bengal tiger that was made in CGI did not help me liking it. So I disliked it to the core. Once, he said Richard Parker (Tiger) was gone at the end, I fell into sleep, I just couldn't take that. Damn, we had been there at the very night of a day (Night 11 PM show) and with all the pains taken, we see an adventure end just like that. It meant nothing for me, and I am going with a 1/5. This 1 rating is for the special effects and the gorgeous titles that were good but not great. Ang Lee, you squeezed me in to this film and you gave me a bad film so this is what I give you back, a negative review. I suppose I among the very few who are going to criticize this movie as most others are going gaga over this. It's okay; I have my own mind anyways.","8/10"
"bradencn","4 February 2024","Listen, I knew what to expect going into this film as far as what kind of movie it would be. Statham plays a great bad ass, and good guys (or guy) are fighting bad guys, and it's clear who's who.But by golly, folks, can we stop pretending that women are hard core police agents and leaders/directors of secret mercenary organizations? It just distracts completely from what I came to watch, it is dishonest and disingenuous, and it's an insult to viewers who just want to enjoy a work of art. For a work if art to have relevance, it HAS to reflect the human experience.So - will this movie resonate with action thriller chancing movie goers? Yes, it's worth watching on a steaming service, but...will the macho women scenes bother and distract you? Yes...further, they will annoy you.I wish Emmy Raver-Lampman a great career, but this movie makes it seem like she is just begging for relevance, and it's probably not even her fault... It's the fault of the writers, the casting requirements, etc.I didn't even mind the dumb dialogue. I came for the action, and I got the action... But it somehow got mixed with visual preaching that women can only be bad asses if they can be like men. Nah...not buying it.","5/10"
"bradenlculver","17 November 2020","The final installment in the reimagined series is storytelling at it's best and on an epic level. The film gets very dark and at times hopeless but is rewardingly satisfying at the other end. The depth and emotion that this film had is something that I feel is missing from other ""blockbuster"" movies and used CGI main characters at that. Long story short, no matter how hard I try I can find nothing wrong with the movie. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" tops the charts in every category","9/10"
"bradinhanson","26 April 2019","* Why buildup Thor only to tear him to shreds in Endgame? You literally destroyed his brand.
* How was Captain Marvel able to locate the ship Tony Stark was on at the beginning of the film?
* Why use ""Quantum Realm"" when the majority of the audience will get confused and lost in it?
* Why did Captain Marvel say she was going to fight Thanos solo when she, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man couldn't even take him down without a use of a gauntlet? Is she really that arrogant?
* Why was Thanos awesome in the first movie, but became a generic villain in Endgame?
* Why did the writers do an awesome job on the infinity war, but fall hard in Endgame? Did someone just tell them, ""let's put all the jokes and scenes you guys want and hopefully it makes sense."" Because that's exactly what it felt like.
* Why doesn't doing anything in the past affect the future? It felt so cringeworthy seeing interactions in previous movies that weren't meant to happen.
* Why has Thor become Batman of the DC universe? Do directors and producers LOVE destroying characters that we love? Seems like it.
* Thor's mother didn't need to be ""trained by witches"" to know that her son Thor was different from her son she saw only moments earlier. So why even bring that up?
* Did everyone who ""died"" in infinity war go to a special spirit world of wakanda and just remain there till 5 years later according to spider-man?
* Why couldn't have anyone simply put on the gauntlet and wiped out Thanoses army? And why didn't Thanos destroy everybody who was a threat to him in infinity war?
* Why did a rat start Endgame by returning ant-man? That seems awfully convenient doesn't it?
* How can Captain America pick up Thor's hammer and even use lightning when he couldn't pick it up in the first avengers movie?
* Where was Captain Marvel most of the movie? Was she vacationing?
* Why was the first hour so slow, The second hour and a half talking about quantum physics that no one understands, and the last 30 minutes of the film fighting when anyone could have simply worn the glove and wiped out thanoses army?
* How did Scarlett Witch seemingly become more powerful than even Captain Marvel?
* Why didn't anyone save Black Widow when everything else can be done with convenience? Did no one just not want to save her because there was no purpose and it just gave them rage to fight?There's a hundred more questions I want to ask, but these are just some of the main ones.","7/10"
"bradykitchen-33648","15 March 2022","This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.9.5/10.","2/10"

"brainsmasher-66","16 July 2017","....continues. There are some really good scenes in this movie. If you have seen the trailers then you have seen all of the good parts. I didn't think they could make a sillier movie than the last one; but they did. Who was the target audience--preschoolers? Just sayin.The opening battle scene is fantastic. There was no way they could top that. They didn't even try. If you're gonna make a movie with talking apes make them all talk like the Planet of the Apes movies in the 60s and 70s. Only one ape can talk; but he reads sign language. The other apes cannot talk; but they all use sign language. A couple of apes can only talk baby talk or maybe they are trying to mimic the retarded. Excuse me, I should use more politically correct terms like mentally challenged or differently abled or people with cognitive disabilities. Nope, I can't do it. They talked like retards.The ape that some people claim is supposed to be a caricature of DeRay McKesson is the silliest character in the movie. He is supposed to be the comic relief ala Jar Jar Binks. Every time he was on screen I couldn't help thinking retard alert from South Park.I do not buy that Hollywood is using this movie to send coded references of the apes as black people. If they had put a monkey in a suit and made him talk like a black preacher and people had complained that they were trying to mimic Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton then I might buy that for a dollar.I thought that Woody Harrelson could save this movie because I like everything Woody Harrelson does. Woody Harrelson doesn't make bad movie choices. Maybe they paid him a boatload of money. Yeah, that's got to be it.The inclusion of the little white girl as a pet for the apes story arc is flawed and misguided, or as I like to think--just plain stupid. The apes kill her ""father"" or whoever the guy is that is caring for her and then she goes gallivanting off with the the apes like it is no big deal. The only way this makes sense is if the older man wasn't her father; but her kidnapper and abuser. Creepy.Even more creepy is when the big black Gorilla gets a crush on the little girl and puts a flower in her hair. I'm sorry; but that is what it looked like to me. One could extrapolate; but you don't really want to go there. When the big black ape gets killed the little girl is really, really, really sad and she puts a flower in his hair. She is more upset when the big black ape dies than she is when her father/kidnapper is killed. Creepy.When the apes first find the little girl she is sick; but apparently not sick enough to go on a cross country trek on horseback with strange apes. She is supposed to be sick with the virus (spoiler alert) which is why she cannot talk. But when you get sick with the virus it causes blood to pour out of your nose and mouth like Ebola and then you lose the ability to speak and then you die. The apes use a doll from the little girl to transmit the virus to the Woody Harrelson character.I could tell you more; but this review is already longer than any other review I have done. Let me recap this for you--silly, silly, silly.PS. The final battle scene is the silliest thing you have ever seen. All of Woody Harrelson's regiment are in one place. They could have been wiped out by one Apache helicopter standing off at a distance; but then there wouldn't be much fodder for a movie. Instead the helicopters make passes like an airplane and get shot down by RPGs. (Spoiler alert) After the other army smokes Woody's men and are celebrating they get wiped out by an avalanche. Oops, I just ruined the whole movie for you. Believe me, I did you a favor.","8/10"
"brando647","5 July 2013","Once I watched this movie, it was impossible to shake from my mind for almost three days after. Each time I've watched it, it's left me in awe. LIFE OF PI is a beautiful film with a magnificent story to tell. From Ang Lee (director of HULKthe one with the gamma poodle yeah, I went there), LIFE OF PI is based on a novel from Yann Martel that, admittedly, I've never read. It is, without a doubt, one of the most (if not, THE most) visually stunning movie of 2013 and the story is one that just stirs around in your head, leaving you to think back on what you've watched and question everything about it. The premise of the story is what originally hooked my attention: a young Indian boy is adrift at sea, trapped aboard a life boat with a Bengal tiger. More specifically, the boy is Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and he was raised in India with his family in their zoo. When times become tough and the zoo must close, his family loads the animals aboard a freighter and they set off for Canada. A storm leaves Pi alone on the Pacific Ocean, a lone survivor from a shipwreck, with an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger along for the ride. LIFE OF PI is a tale of faith and survival that might, as an adult Pi describes as he recounts his tale to an interested author, ""make you believe in God."" Ultimate belief in a deity is not guaranteed, but an incredible story with mind-blowing effects is.So, for a little context from this commenter, I am not religious or spiritual in any real sense. You don't necessarily need to be in order to enjoy this movie. This is not a movie to preach religious faith or drive home points about how belief in God is important or whatever. This is one man's account of a life-changing event in his life and how (and more importantly why) it strengthened his belief in God. The character of Pi Patel is more than your average Hindu. He's Hindu, Christian, and Muslim with a possible bit of Jewish mixed in. He's a boy who loves God in all his forms and his faith will be put to the test over the course of this two-hour film as he is trapped in the middle of the largest ocean in a lifeboat with a tiger. As if survival isn't difficult enough when you're trapped thousands of miles from anywhere with limited food and clean water, but a hungry carnivorous cat tends to exacerbate problems. Pi will face hunger, weather, and his fellow passengers in his long quest across the ocean while maintaining his faith that his God (of many faces) is watching over him. And in the end, when Pi returns to society and gives us (and two Japanese insurance adjustors) a second version of his tale, we are introduced to a new understanding behind faith in a higher power and what leads people into it. As a firmly non-religious person, I actually thought it was one of the most enlightening descriptions of religious faith I've heard. And it's all done without being preachy.LIFE OF PI is, as you've probably heard just about any time the movie is discussed, an amazing visual feast. I don't like to use the term because I think it comes across as corny, but I'll make a rare exception for LIFE OF PI: it is stunning. Ang Lee, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and the visual effects team have created a gorgeous film. It's not often you see a movie of this caliber anymore. LIFE OF PI is a prime example of film as art, as opposed to summer blockbusters or cash-grab sequels. The visual effects in this movie are superb but you might not think so when watching it. It wasn't until after I'd seen the movie twice that I discover that the majority of scenes with Richard Parker, the tiger, are a CG animal. In fact, most of the animals in the film are CG. That blew my mind. Not once over the course of the movie did I question whether the animals I was watching were real. In a time when I can go to your average summer film and count the CG elements, it is great that there are movies that incorporate such subtlety that you might never question what you're watching.On a related note, I am one that would argue that the Academy Award LIFE OF PI won for cinematography was undeserved because so much of the movie was done as visual effects. As beautiful as this movie was, there were others in 2012 more deserving of the recognition for their work with physical lighting and camera-work.","6/10"
"brandoconner-83700","2 June 2023","The animation was absolutely amazing along with the action and soundtrack. Miles and Gwen definitely feel more fleshed out in this one, however I feel that some of the dialogue gets to be a bit too corny and tries to hard to be quirky. I expected Miguel to have more of a role aside from the final 30 minutes of the movie, same goes for the villain who is introduced with a rushed backstory who only makes 1 more appearance in the entire second half of the movie. I did have a good time watching it and it's by no means a bad movie, just not the ""Masterpiece"" everyone is building it up to be and is certainly not, ""The Greatest Animated Movie Of All Time"".","10/10"
"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","9/10"
"brandonmckay8","15 February 2023","Caught an advanced screening of this tonight & despite the negative reviews I had read this was pleasantly surprising for me. The blend of action, storytelling & comedy was much better balanced than recent Marvel films, the visual effects were beautiful, also much better than recent additions. I did enjoy the first two Ant-Man's better than this one but found this one was most definitely worth a trip to the cinema. Kathryn Newton very well casted for Cassie & adds well to the movie. Some moments with Scott were really beautifully done along with some humour, especially early on. Cassie's admiration for Jentorra was really cool & the 'just stop being a dick' to Darren (who returns in a funny way) was brilliant. Loved Paul Rudd's delivery of this line:
Kang: You're not the one with the hammer?Scott: That's Thor. We get confused a lot. Similar body types.Overall this movie is better than a lot of recent marvel films but not as good as the franchise once was. There are two credit scenes, one near the start of the credits & one right at the end.","7/10"
"branflakes4547","28 May 2019","This is such an excellent movie and a perfect capper to the trilogy. In terms of summer blockbusters it is nearly perfect save for Wopdy Harrelson phoning it in the entire time. The ending and buildup and cinematography and acting and production quality are all top notch. Nearly incredible I would recommend this movie and trilogy to anybody. I don't know why these movies don't get more praise. Perhaps they are overlooked as action schlock- because there's apes using guns riding horses and driving tanks. But do you really need a high brow planet of the apes movie in 2019? I still think about the ending to this movie quite frequently as it really stuck with me. Go rent this trilogy and start from the beginning (the 2011 film with James Franco) they get better with each one and this one is one of the best summer blockbusters in recent memory (except for Mad Max of course)","2/10"
"bregund","4 July 2023","Disney seems to be on a mission to destroy all popular white male characters, but even beyond that, I find it hard to believe that Harrison Ford read the script and happily signed up. Is this really how he wanted his character to go out? Or are we going to see him in a wheelchair sometime in 2033, with his unappealing ""god daughter"" wheeling him around Prague or Cairo? In terms of costars, at this point he has run out of family members and now he's cycling through family acquaintances. Why not the nephew of his college roommate or his dry cleaner? By far the best chemistry Indiana Jones ever had with a costar was with Sean Connery, even Shia Laboeuf was okay, but this odd, unappealing ""god daughter"" belittling and emasculating him is unbearable to watch. It's difficult to believe that Ford thought this was a good idea. See what I mean, elder abuse.","7/10"
"breheneyjames","15 July 2017","Wow. First off let me just say how excited I am for Matt Reeves to direct 'The Batman'. He took the reigns of this franchise from Rupert Wyatt after 'Rise' and really made it his own and elevated it with 'Dawn'. I also believe he elevated it again with 'War' which closes out this superb prequel trilogy.There is not a wasted shot in this film. Everyone of them is composed with an impressive attention to detail that just leaves you in awe. It is clear that Matt Reeves is a strong visual director and he works with his cinematographer Michael Seresin very well here to deliver some of the best visuals of the year so far.There are many inspirations on display in this film that Matt Reeves has talked about from 'The Ten Commandments', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Even the first appearance of Caesar in the movie has his colony of apes parting to make way for their leader a la the red seas for Moses. Also the score by Michael Giacchino is the perfect companion for this story and has a 'Seven Samurai' feel to it.The story is powerful and emotionally resonant thanks to full bodied characters and a stunning performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar. If there was ever a time for him to receive an Academy Award nomination for his work this would be it. Steve Zahn is also fantastic as Bad Ape who works wonderfully as comedic relief in an otherwise grim and dreary film. Other performances of note are Woody Harrelson as The Colonel who gives you every reason to resent him but is also someone who is affected by personal tragedy (which leads to a moving scene where Caesar empathizes with him) and Amiah Miller as Nova who says a lot without speaking a word. The 'War' that the title refers to is not a physical war but a war of ideals between both Caesar and The Colonel and within Caesar himself. So don't expect an all out action set-piece a minute war movie. It's a much more personal, dramatic and emotional story and the film is all the more better for it. A perfect movie to round out a perfect trilogy. Apes. Together. Strong.","2/10"
"brentsbulletinboard","20 February 2023","If you're looking for a dazzling display of special effects (especially in 3-D), then this latest installment in the Marvel Universe's ""Ant-man"" franchise is for you. However, if you're looking for an absorbing story, more along the lines of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" (2022), you'll probably want to look elsewhere, despite the superb eye candy on offer here. Though visually dazzling, director Payton Reed's latest feels like something of a placeholder entry in the ongoing string of movies in this long-running series of action-adventures. Set in a vividly colorful, fantastically landscaped universe that exists below our reality at the quantum level, this picture tells the story of an unlikely superhero (Paul Rudd) and his family of colleagues (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathryn Newton) who become inadvertently trapped in this strange world and desperately look for a way to get home, but they must first match wits with a dastardly, powerful villain (Jonathan Majors) who stands in their way. What ultimately transpires, however, is a story that's eminently predictable and fairly formulaic, reminiscent of many other such tales, such as ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010). Also, like many other Marvel movies, the concluding sequence is once again entirely too long (even though the overall length of this production is, thankfully, comparatively shorter than many of its protracted peer releases). To its credit, the film features fine performances by Pfeiffer and Majors, as well as a commendably lucid explanation of the rudiments of quantum physics. However, these strengths, along with its stunning visuals, aren't enough to overcome the overall narrative blandness of this offering. While ""Quantumania"" is certainly best viewed on the big screen in 3-D for maximum visual effect, this film might otherwise be considered a candidate worth waiting for its streaming debut. The kind of overkill on display in this work isn't doing the Marvel Universe any good, something that really needs to be borne in mind for the future of these releases.","6/10"
"brentsbulletinboard","3 July 2023","It seems these days that it's become all too easy to blast popular, commercial fare simply because it is popular, commercial fare. Granted, some offerings of this type genuinely deserve whatever grief they get, but others, such as the latest installment in this long-running franchise, don't merit unfair potshots fired at them just for innately being mainstream offerings. In many ways, this is very much cut from the same cloth as its action adventure predecessors, but there are enough distinctions, new developments and lesser-known elements to keep it fresh and interesting throughout. Now, this is not to suggest that this final entry in this action adventure series is without its faults - it's overlong, some of its action sequences could have been easily pared back (despite generally being as good as they are) and the storyline tends to sag somewhat in the middle. However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve. So, to all those cynics out there who are shamelessly bashing this release to be fashionable or hip, all I can say is ""pipe down and lose the attitude already.""","1/10"
"brettkgraham","1 May 2023","Man oh man, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was so so average. This gimmicky kind of misplaced Marvel comedy is so redundant at this point. Also, how many times can Cassey and Scott hug before or after a fight in one movie. The best part of Ant-Man Came in the last 5 minutes. I feel like Marvel has done the bright cheery movies for too long at this point and needs to take their movies in a more serious (not necessarily dark) tone but definitely more serious. Tuning into a Marvel movie at this point you just know The formulaic movie that you're getting with not many surprises. Love Paul Rudd so I thought he was great. Jonathan Majors as Kang was great just like I said in Loki but with his personal battles I wonder what Marvel will do. Side note: total bs that Flash is getting RAVE reviews when Ezra Miller is an absolute legit psychopath and Jonathan Majors is being disbanded over accusations that have been dropped. Back to the movie: wasn't huge on the CGI/ scenery. Wasn't huge on the acting. Wasn't huge on the storyline. Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania gets a 6.6/10 for me. I'm on the edge of my seat for Guardians Of TheGalaxy to get Marvel back to that 8+ rating it so routinely sat at for me. Marvel has to step it up at this point as DC appears to be on their heels.","7/10"
"Brevin_Campbell","10 February 2019","When it comes to Japanese animation the franchise of Dragon Ball is probably one of the biggest if not already the most massive. The series, Dragon Ball Z, ran on television from 1996-2003 across 291 episodes and was a cultural phenomenon. The series has sense had a total of 15 movies and loads of merchandising. It was no surprise to most fans of japanese cartoons that the film managed to land in the top 5 making 11 million dollars domestically. (Box Office Mojo) The film does quite a lot to please both old fans and new ones. And in comparison to the older film Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan this film is not only surpasses it but create a more compelling narrative. It does this with its more compelling characters and backstories for this universe.The film starts out by giving us a bit of backstory on not only the enemy but the world that the Dragon Ball Universe inhabits as it gives us the history on a alien race called ""Saiyans"" or ""Saiyajin""for the japanese audience. It talks about a tyrannical ruler named Frieza who becomes the ruler of this planet of saiyans after their father, King Cold, grants them this authority. This entire halve allows people who have never watched Dragon Ball before to have more of a clear idea of what is going on in the film. Allowing the viewer to get a strong sense for what this franchise is all about. It however also changes the lore up for old fans so that way they stay entertained throughout this first halve by giving us new characters such as the main character, Goku, having a mother, or giving us a better idea of how the saiyan race tends to operate.But what makes the Dragon Ball movie truly more sophisticated than the simple brawls that the series has been known for is its deep dive into its main antagonist, Broly, who is given a rich and complex backstory that will leave many non fans quite impressed as the film attempts to pull on your heart strings. It is probably one of the few times that the writer, Akira Toriyama, has attempted to create such a interesting character. If you look at the original film Broly is much more of this one note brute who only says ""Kakarot"" over and over, and is simply used as a plot device who the heroes must defeat, but here Broly is a person who has been forced into battle by his father, but we see scenes in the film that Broly doesn't want to fight for his dad, and would rather live a more peaceful life. These are aspects of Broly that really help us understand the character being crafted on screen. The film also gives us some new additions like Cheelai who ends up being a pretty great new addition to the rest of the cast and plays a prominent role in Broly's character development. There is a scene between Broly and her when they are at a cafeteria in which Cheelai takes interest and Broly and shows that she finds herself caring a lot for the brute even being willing to protect him.
Now the film is still at the end of the day a Dragon Ball film and because of that there is still a big action fight in the 3rd act and its pretty great, but unlike the action scenes in previous Dragon Ball films this act has more weight to it because you care about the character involved. This gives the action more weight in the big explosive battle.The animation in the final fight also looks incredibly beautiful. When you see the main character and Broly going at each other you can't help but get immersed in the fight and take in all the action. Your eyes wander throughout the screen trying to take in every color change, every deviation of position of the characters, and it becomes both overwhelming but also engaging in a way that allows you to have a clear understanding of what each character is doing, and for that reason alone it is extremely entertaining.There are some areas of the film were the animation dropped in quality mainly for the more comedic moments during the action halve. It was obvious a decent amount of the budget had to go the main character and antagonist punching each other and because of that everything going on around the fight had to be have its quality diminished which was quite disappointing for me as a fan. And while the fights were cool to look at it and the backstory does help them it is a very extensive fight. The movie is 1 hour and 41 mins and the fight takes up pretty much the entire 41 minutes. And it actually ends up being quite glorious the way they manage it. And I must give the director, Tatsuya Nagamine, a lot of props for managing to pull something like this off because it couldn't have been easy.In conclusion Dragon Ball Super: Broly works pretty well as a Dragon Ball film, and even manages to break some expectations giving us a more complex antagonist with a rich and endearing backstory to go along with it. The animation isn't always perfect and the action long winded, but is a great and enjoyable time at the theater and one that I feels really works in spades. And rather you are a new fan or a older one both groups will get something from it.","8/10"
"brianjohnson-20043","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","3/10"

"Brillfury","13 January 2024","Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day.","2/10"
"browniesnack57","16 February 2023","I feel as if Kevin Feige likes to play connect four with characters in this universe. ""Don't be a dick"" misses the mark by about half a mile in terms of moralising, but I digress. Paul Rudd is turning Scott Lang into an appealing underdog, one ant at a time...and I can definitely get on board with his skills being essential in the trials and tribulations ahead.On the other hand, this movie has a vibe of stumbling through this landscape of mystery with one arm tied behind his back and two eyepatches. Echolocation works best in the courtroom-ask Matt Murdock. It has no place in an establishing prequel.Respectfully, it has no right posturing with two posters, and relying on a post credits scene advertising Loki and Morbius' next adventures coming this summer. Just, no.","7/10"
"brsmarc","23 May 2018","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","2/10"
"Bruce722","29 November 2012","I honestly didn't expect to say this again in the current calendar year but ""this is probably the best movie I have seen this year"". Yes, I think this is probably even a better movie that The Dark Knight Returns which I was all but certain would be my personal Picture of the Year winner. Life of Pi was simply amazing. The story is incredible and the way the film is delivered couldn't be better. You truly go on this story with Pi Patel and Richard Parker. The acting by Suraj Sharma is surprisingly fantastic as well. Some people will surely call this movie boring because it has a slower pace to it but Tom Hanks' Castaway film was also on the slower side and as that movie showed, if a film is well done the slow pace allows for more emotion and a connection to the characters. Shoot, I got watery eyes when Hanks' character lost Wilson and that was a stinking volleyball, lol. This movie plays along that same style of a slow paced story of survival but is done even better due to the incredible cinematography that rivals Avatar in terms of magnificence. Another thing Life of Pi did remarkably well was end without disappointment. By that, I do not mean that the ending isn't sad. I mean that the ending lives up to the film. Again, take Castaway for example. That movie was great but its ending was quick and left a lot to be desired. The ending for Life of Pi throws a subtle twist that is sort of a mind blowing moment. That subtle twist leaves you pondering the events of the film well after it ends.","10/10"

Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","10/10"

This movie is a complete revision of the original one, and it works so good. The animations are spot on, the storyboard, and everything else. The fighting scenes are the best ever to happen in all the series or the movies. This is just Amazing.
The only downfall is the composition of the movie. Initially all the material was about 3h long, and they had to cut it down. And you kinda notice it in the first half. For that only a 9/10, but I reckon once the Blue-Ray version is out, it might be a solid 10/10.","4/10"
"btb154","18 January 2024","I hadn't seen anything about this movie's ""plot"" (using that term very fast and loosely) ahead of my viewing except for the poster. I was able to articulate the entire plot to my wife before walking into the theater. Basically this one man goes through two branches of the federal law enforcement agencies without getting even a scratch. All law enforcement agencies behave like the keystone cops. Zero efforts were taken to write the smallest amount of realism into this script. I strongly believe Jeromy Irons can actually be scene laughing to him self during some of his ""serious scenes"" because he's going to fire his agent while at the same time thinking to himself ""I've done Shakespeare!"" The only positive aspects are the legitimate phishing scam used at the beginning (not the software) and the fight choreography which can be seen done much better in any of the John Wick films. I made sure to throw away my ticket stub to avoid any reminders or evidence I've seen this film. It's physically impossible to provide spoilers to this movie because there Was no plot.","2/10"
"btkb","23 March 2020","These are all of the Planet of the Apes movies I watched. I hope these reviews are helpful. I have different tastes in movies, so you may not agree with me. Some are just stories about them, which may help you decide whether to watch it or not.Planet of the Apes (1968) - The ending was a surprise since it looks like the astronaut witnessed what the future will look like and all. The apes were pretty good. Of course, CGI did not exist, so they were in costumes. Overall, it was great.Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) - I was surprised another astronaut had arrived. Of course, he got the same treatment like the previous human did since apes saw humans as animals. Basically, both of these movies are reverse roles, where humans are apes, and apes are like humans. The ending was different since they meet some sort of telepathic humans who was going to set a bomb that would destroy the planet. It's pretty good movie!Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) - Two of the apes we saw in the first two movies who saved the humans had to escape from the planet since it was going to be destroyed. Of course, they went back in time. The roles are reversed again. This time, the humans are surprised to see the apes talking. Sadly, they both die, but gave birth to a son named Caesar. Well, the name was something else. The ending was sad since both of the baby ape's parents died since the man did not want them to soon rule the Earth. Here, you will see how the apes ruled the Earth in the future.Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) - Caesar is fully grown, but he has to pretend he is a slave ape like the others, and that he is not allowed to speak since they will capture him. Of course, the owner who protected and took care of him dies because he doesn't want to take Caesar to the police. You see that later, Caesar and the other apes have war against the humans who treated them badly. It's pretty intense.Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) - Apes have their own territory, and Caesar has his own family. Humans are getting along with them and helping them. Of course, they have rules there too. The ending becomes intense when apes are fighting with apes since some did not like Caesar ruling. Watch these original movies!Planet of the Apes (2001) - Similar to the first Planet of the Apes movie. The difference is that the CGI started improving to where they did not use humans to where costumes. The thing is, it was really different than the original. The astronaut lands on Earth, where apes rule the planet. But before that, him and his crew at his timeline, sent an ape in space as an experiment. Of course, the ape disappears into some sort of orbit or particles. The man goes to retrieve him back, but he gets sucked into it. There, he is sent to the future where apes are ruled. The story is the same as the original, but this time, the humans can talk in this one. The ape that he sent in his timeline, turns out to be the king or the ruler of the planet, where they respected him. After the battle ended to where they accepted the humans, the man goes back to his timeline. This got confusing. General Thade is an ape that wanted to kill the man when he was there. After he came back to his timeline, he looks up at what appears to be the Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade, who had later escaped, also traveled back in time through the same electromagnetic storm and conquered humanity. Leo is descended upon by a swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters, all of whom are apes. It seems they wanted to make a sequel of this, but I guess they haven't. I do not blame for having low ratings to this since the ending was confusing, or the movie and storylines were bad.Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - Completely different story to the first original one. This time, it is humans experimenting apes. The female ape goes berserk, and has to be taken down. They find out she is pregnant and gives birth. The baby ape is Caesar, who possesses human intelligence. The thing is, he later gets taken to the shelter along with other apes because of his immaturity or for what he has done to his neighbor for yelling at his owner's father. Nice of him to protect him. We then see Caesar becoming tougher since the guy in the shelter was being super mean to him. He then yells ""NO!"" which shocks the other apes and the man since he can talk. Of course, the battle between humans and apes starts. Best movie and special effects I have ever seen!Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) - We see the apes finding a colony. One of the ape, Koba, is different compared to Caesar when it comes to dealing with humans. He was abused by them, so we can see why he doesn't like them. Koba tries to kill Caesar for what he has decided. Caesar doesn't know this, and so, decided to attack him in the end because ""apes don't kill apes."" The problem with this was that Koba caused the apes to deal with more problems in the future since the man he negotiated with, had a friend who called in the military people about them. Caesar and the men told the humans that saved him to stay somewhere safe. Caesar and the other apes were preparing for the war against the military humans. This gets intense! Watch this movie!War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) - The title itself explains it all, along with the previous movie! The war is between the military army and apes. Throughout this movie, we see a sad scene where Caesar sees a Colonel killing his eldest son and his wife. He wanted revenge for what the Colonel has done. Of course, as he went, he gets captured at their base along with his other fellow apes. The Colonel explains about the simian flu his son had dealt with, and that he had lost his son because of the apes and their spread of disease. Later, with the help of a human child, who couldn't speak, along with another ape who could speak as well because he learned it by listening to the humans, help out the others, and got the apes to escape. Caesar was going to kill the Colonel, but he saw the Colonel having the simian flu as well. Instead, he left him to kill himself instead. Another army then comes who were after the Colonel and his men. Caesar blows up the base, along with that, was an avalanche which wiped out both of the armies. They, later, escaped, and they found a place where they can have peace. Sadly, Caesar dies because of his wounds and injuries. The girl stays with them. This movie is great! Best movie of all! Worth it!Watch all of it since I could be telling the story wrong!","9/10"
"Buddy-51","15 March 2014","In an era in which CGI has made it possible to put virtually anything one could possibly imagine up on the screen, it has become harder and harder for a filmmaker to make an audience's collective jaw drop. But Ang Lee achieves just that with his adaptation of Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi."" This movie truly has what we, in modern parlance, like to refer to as ""the wow factor,"" simply because it is unlike anything we've seen on screen before. ""Life of Pi"" is a surrealistic tale of survival about an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a ferocious Bengal tiger for a companion. The first thought we are struck with while watching ""Life of Pi"" is that this movie would have been impossible to make prior to the CGI revolution in filmmaking. With so many movies abusing that technology for sheer commercial ends, it's gratifying to see a film actually using it for thought-provoking and artistic purposes (see also ""Gravity""). At times brutally harsh while at others gloriously lyrical, the movie combines the realistic with the fantastical, the rational with the spiritual - all to illustrate the many disparate and dichotomous elements that, working in glorious chaotic tandem, make up this vast expanse we call the universe. The first third of the film focuses on Pi's life before the shipwreck. Pi (short for Piscine, which as it shares a rather unfortunate homonym in English, causes Pi at a very early age to abbreviate it) is innately curious about not only the world around him but the world that lies beyond the physical. He is so fascinated with the spiritual, in fact, that he has adopted the tenets of each of the world's major religions and made them his own. Pi lives with his stern, skeptical father (Adil Hussain), his more open-minded, sympathetic mother (Tabu) and his somewhat less curious older brother (who is played by three different actors in various stages of the story). One of the prime exhibits in the zoo owned by Pi's father is a Bengal tiger that, through a bureaucratic fluke, has been tagged with the name Richard Parker, a prosaic moniker hardly befitting the king of the jungle. When the father decides to sell the zoo, the family, along with the animals, board a Japanese freighter to begin a new life in Canada (the plan is to sell the animals once they get there). On the way, however, tragedy strikes when the ship sinks in a tremendous storm, sending all but Pi and Richard Parker to the bottom of the sea. ""Life of Pi"" is the story of their survival.Alternately awe-inspiring, heartbreaking and suspenseful, the screenplay by David Magee expands on the ""circle of life"" metaphor to explore how each element of nature is interlocked with every other element, with each action prompting a reaction unto infinity. Though natural born ""enemies,"" Pi and Richard Parker achieve a kind of symbiosis, ultimately forced to rely on one another for survival (RP for his physical needs, Pi for his spiritual), and in so doing, they achieve a harmony that puts them in sync with the rest of the universe. Yet, for all its pantheistic elements, the movie doesn't over-sentimentalize nature, doesn't shy away from showing us the unthinking brutality that is also a part of that universe, underlined by the fact that living creatures can survive only by feeding on other living creatures. It certainly never downplays the very real danger Pi is in at every moment from his feline companion. This cat may be animated, but he's no cartoon character.Never one to shy away from a challenge, Lee won a second Best Director Oscar for his work here, and someday the Academy might even see fit to bestow a Best Picture award on him as well (he was certainly robbed of that honor for ""Brokeback Mountain""). As he has done many times before, Lee demonstrates a total command of the medium in ""Life of Pi."" There's a hallucinatory quality to much of the film, as Pi frequently experiences preternatural visions that transcend the confines of the material world and of rational thought, leading him to a oneness with God. Suraj Shama has been handed the challenge - one might almost call it the burden - of carrying large stretches of this film entirely on his own, with only a CGI effect to interact with. It is a challenge the gifted young actor is more than equipped to handle and he fulfills it beautifully.Though the movie throws the audience for a loop at the end, making us question the veracity of the tale the adult Pi (Irrfan Kahn) is relating to the writer (Rafe Spall) who hopes to chronicle the experience, no one can ever convince the true believer in all of us that this is anything other than a love story between a boy and a tiger. After all - thanks to the technical wizards who've made it all possible - we've seen it with our own eyes.","8/10"
"bunsen2019","2 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot follows Thanos around on his quest to collect 5 stones, achieve control of all dimensions and eliminate half of humanity in an attempt to save planets from population induced ecosystem destruction/annihilation. Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.","10/10"
"burlesonjesse5","2 July 2023","Let's get this right out of the way shall we, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fourth best entry in the franchise's 42-year canon. That basically means it's better than ""Crystal Skull"" (basically). ""Dial's"" running time is almost two and a half hours but it doesn't feel like it. And there's plenty of loud, bone-crunching stuff even though you can't fully see who's shooting and/or punching who.Now am I going to recommend Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny? I am but for reasons other than that rip-roaring, caper medium. Yup, ""Dial"" feels just like an Indiana Jones pic until it well, doesn't. The incorporation of time travel and everyone's favorite archaeologist, yeah I can dig it.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes place in 1969 with an opening flashback via World War II. James Mangold takes over the reins as director from Steven Spielberg. Yeah I'm not going to lie, Mangold is a solid storyteller and the way ""Dial"" unfolds in its last act is truly awesome and invigorating. As for the look of the film, well it too is solid, all glistening and shiny and CGI'd to the hilt.What Mangold lacks however, is Spielberg's aptness for staging action sequences, you know the attention to detail, the editing, the spine-chilling progression (revert back to first paragraph). Heck, ""Dial"" isn't really action adventure, it's more like a revealing family dramatization coupled with elongated chase concatenations. It's as if James Mangold couldn't let Ford v Ferrari go.Oh well. ""Dial"" is overall, fast-faced and mostly entertaining (if you can suspend a little aerodynamic disbelief). ""Raiders"" had the ark, ""Temple of Doom"" had the stones, ""Last Crusade"" had the Holy Grail, and ""Crystal Skull"" had the gulp, alien skull (ugh). Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has the pursuit of an Archimedes Dial (there's always a pursuit).With star Harrison Ford at an all-time curmudgeon level (what'd you expect, he's 80) and co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge dutifully on board (she plays goddaughter Helena Shaw), ""Dial"" is a summer movie that's an open mind alternative to DC and Marvel fodder (that would be Spidey and the Flash). Manifest ""destiny"".","3/10"
"burntoutboy","11 January 2024","I was expecting a silly and over the top action with little to no plot. What I got was silly and basic action with a plot that just doesn't make any sense and an accent that is confusing.Let me start with the positive. The action was fine but basic. The saving grace was the final fight at the end which I thought was well done. Wish there was more of it throughout the film.What I was hoping for (probably wishful thinking) was a memorable fight scene or action sequence but there wasn't.The accent Jason Statham was trying do, no idea what he was thinking. It was all over the place.Overall there was no buzz around this and should have just gone straight to streaming.","5/10"
"burntoutboy","2 June 2023","Wow wow wow. This is absolute masterpiece, cannot fault it at all. The animation is probably the best I've ever seen. The level of detail is ridiculous and the amount of effort that went into making this is clearly shown. The voice acting is great, the music is great, it's funny and lots of cool Easter eggs. The story is great as well and leads perfectly into the sequel which I absolutely cannot wait for.I wouldn't be surprised if not only if this was nominated for best animated picture at the Oscars but also best picture, it's that good.There's nothing more to say, just go watch it in yh Cinema and appreciate the art!","10/10"
"c-97498","15 May 2018","In all my years as a Marvel Comic fan this is the worst outing as far as I am concerned. Yes it did follow through on many out lying factors but I was gob-smacked as to the ending. While I will not give away the ending I will say I was greatly displeased. It would make me think hard about spending my money on their next Marvel outing","10/10"
"cadillac20","3 June 2023","Can't rave enough about this movie. Everything was excellent and I have nothing I can think of to complain about. It was a joy to be back, hanging out with Miles, Gwen, Peter, and the handful of new characters. The film takes it's time early on developing Gwen and Miles as they live their separate lives in their respective dimensions and deal with the frustrations and realities of being their own Spider persons. We're immediately given the emotional weight of Gwen's life, one that is very lonely and who has seemingly lost the only friend she had left after having to say goodbye to Miles. Miles is in a similar predicament, though he is less hung up on being alone and missing Gwen, and more so on having to balance school, his responsibilities to his parents, and his role as Spider-Man.After spending some time with their respective lives, we get to the meat of the story, which involves new villain-of-the-week-becoming-major-villain The Spot, who is setting out to further disrupt the multiverse after Kingpin's plot in the first movie. Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099, comes into the picture as having established a hub of Spider characters from various dimensions who are attempting to fix the anomalies created by the collider's explosion from the first film. Miguel acts as a darker version of Spider-Man who has little tolerance for anyone treating their task with anything but the utmost seriousness.The animation and art is once again excellent, this time giving us various designs for the different Spider characters, with Spider Punk and Crimson Spider being highlights. Everyone gets a chance to shine as a character, even when their part is small and the loads of easter eggs and references will delight fans while not feeling superfluous or there purely for fan service. Like No Way Home, this is a celebration of the Spider-Man franchise, but feeling like it's celebrating the entirety of the brand, covering everything from comics, animation, live action, and even the video games. There are quite a few pleasant surprises.Some might be off put by the abrupt ending, especially if they have no idea this the first part of a two part film duoglogy, but having known this going in, I felt pretty comfortable with where it ended. It is a cliffhanger ending, so don't expect to feel like the story has an ending, but it creates an anticipation for the next movie and it's something I can wait patiently for as it comes early next year. Overall, the film, like the first one, demonstrates itself to be one of the year's best. I even expect this to possibly be my favorite film of 2023.","10/10"
"calebbrookscj","8 June 2023","Over many years, sequels have been known to sweep Hollywood off its feet. Making films like Empire strikes back and Top Gun Maverick which were absolutely superior to their predecessors in every way. Now Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does that absolute feat after the audience patiently awaited for Miles Morales's return to the big screen after 5 years. Every single member of the Animation team poured their heart and soul's into each individual design for not only the locations but also each individual character. Even with this film being one piece of the pie, it is quite delectable in every way.Person note: In 2018,I experienced Miles Morales's origin for the first time when i watched Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse at the Cinemark Theater, which in all honesty became one of my favorite films of all time. It's animation was one of the most unique styles that I had laid my eyes on at the time. The use of a multiverse gave a perfect blend of characters to help Miles story grow. So after the film gained it's successful stardom, the announcement of a two parted sequel hit the internet by a storm of support, which is particularly the best reaction the internet could give. No one could comprehend how remarkable it would become.Across the Spider-Verse is what would be regarded as a Spider-Man fans dream film. It not only respects the source material given from the films, games and comics but it also gives a compelling story that everyone will love and isn't dragged by it's sheer amount of cameos. The easter eggs and references that are incorporated into the film are used very well and will in all honesty blow the audience's minds.","9/10"

"CANpatbuck3664","12 July 2023","I'm probably not alone in this opinion but one of the things that really separates Indiana Jones' adventures as such an amazing series is how funny these movies are. Harrison's an underrated comic talent and I laugh uproariously every time I watch Raiders or the Last Crusade (Temple of Doom as well but maybe a little less often). There were scenes that garnered some hearty laughs from me in Dial of Destiny but it was a little more spotty. I think part of this is that Indy is a more inherently beaten-down and sad character after the tragedy he's suffered but the proceedings overall feel a little more serious and that choice comes with it's pros and cons. Indy has always succeeded through a combination of book smarts, street smarts and more than a few lucky bounces and while the new creative team was aware of that, I think they could have played into it more. They might have over-corrected a little from how silly Crystal Skull ended up being.James Mangold takes over as the mantle of director from industry titan Steven Spielberg and I would think part of the reason he got the gig is his experience with big budget action flicks (Mangold's past credits include Logan, Ford v Ferarri and 3:10 to Yuma among others). Dial has a ton of action and there's a concerted effort to follow in the same style as the previous entries of the franchise. If there's an area where Dial really stands on it's own two feet, in my opinion it's in the action set-pieces. They ebb and flow well and while they have the same kind of flavour, they do their own thing with it (they show a lot more of the carnage without being too gratuitous). Does anything approach the original trilogy? I'd still say no but the Indy movies are the gold standard for a reason. I don't think there's another movie period that so seamlessly blends how thrilling, effortlessly funny and memorable those scenes are. So I can't penalize Dial too harshly for being solid if unspectacular in this area.Harrison Ford loves playing Indy and it's perhaps the defining role of his career (I prefer Indy to Han, just my opinion). He's still good as Henry Jones Jr. Here but he understandably is limited by his age (e.g. The CGI on younger Indy is pretty good but it's weird hearing older Harrison Ford's voice come out of his younger computer-generated body). He's still a treat to watch as this character and he does what he can. The star of the show and the biggest surprise of the movie for me was Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw. I'm not familiar with Fleabag so I didn't really have any previous experience with her work but I was really surprised with how effortless her charisma and her performance were here. She was great working with Harrison, she handled both the dramatic and the comedic moments deftly and she succeeded whether others had previously failed. It was great to see John Rhys-Davies as Sallah again, he came to play and while he's aged quite a bit, he brought Sallah's enthusiasm and joy to this project as well. Getting Mads Mikkelsen as Dr. Vollmer was great casting, he gets the job done in Dial but I wish they had given him more solo screentime. He's an amazing actor and he deserved a more developed part to play. Ditto for Antonio Banderas as Renaldo, he's got screen presence for days and I was disappointed that there wasn't more chances for him to show off his comic chops. Toby Jones was cast well as Basil Shaw, he's a great character actor, he's more the Sean Connery type of sidekick and it suits him. I did want to point out the one performance that really stood out but not in a good way. I've liked Boyd Holbrook in other projects but I was taken aback by how out of sync he seemed with everything else. I couldn't tell if he was supposed to be comedic relief or a scary and ruthless killer, it seemed to flip flop depending on the scene. I still think he's a good actor but I was legitimately confused at what he and the movie were trying to do with his character.While I like the movie overall, I also don't disagree with some of the criticism being lobbied at it. The movie pops when it needs to but underneath the on-screen product, it did feel too pat and a little manipulative. The studio obviously poured a ton of money into this and instead of what felt like cinematic magic in the original trilogy, Dial feels like the movie was calculated to the most finite degree. Dial is over-manufactured and over-produced but I'm not sure how much that could have been avoided. It's not a crime for Indy 5 to be found guilty of, it's just a little disappointing.I get the impulse to just rail against the final product here. I'm coming at this as a die-hard Indy fan, Raiders is still my favourite movie of all time. Does Dial of Destiny recapture the old magic? I'd argue that it does in moments but I don't know if anyone ever will replicate that entire elixir again. The action is solid, there are some good performances and I think it still hits the mark more than it doesn't. It's way better than Crystal Skull (you can decide how impressive of a complement that is) and while I acknowledge that Dial feels a little less enchanting, I still enjoyed myself. As long as expectations are kept low, it's worth checking out in theatres. It's a decent last ride for Indiana and a better send off than what had been fated to the character in the previous entry.","8/10"
"CANpatbuck3664","26 January 2024","The reviews I've seen for The Beekeeper laud it for being ""straightforward fun"" and ""an enjoyable throwback."" The underlying message is that The Beekeeper is enjoyable if you can appreciate it for the genre thrills. Now that I've seen it, you're going to get what you want from the action. Bones are broken, bullets go flying and the bad guys are punished for their misdeeds in a satisfying and well utilized manner. I actually think the team behind the camera deserves a lot of credit for this. David Ayer gets a bad rap for a couple of lacklustre movies sprinkled in with a few great ones (including one that's in the pantheon of my all time favourites, EoW) but his direction here is at least a level above from what you typically get in this style of movie. The Beekeeper boasts Ayer's famous gritty feel and this also accents the fight scenes. But I also think the movie looks really good between the cinematography and being cut together really well so I want to credit Director of Photography Gabriel Beristain and Editor Geoffrey O'Brien for helping The Beekeeper punch above it's weight class.I've already admitted to being a big fan of David Ayer but I'm also a longtime defender of Jason Statham. He's one of the few leading men with the chops and screen presence to lead an action movie in our modern cinematic environment (without putting on a superhero costume). He's a decent actor but more importantly, he's also secretly hilarious when given the opportunity (if you get a chance, check out his turn as Rick Ford in Spy, he's phenomenal in that movie). I was excited that he was getting another potential franchise to lead but while he's certainly bringing his physicality to Adam Clay, there's a complete absence of his charm. He mostly grunts his way through the proceedings and his character felt like a rehash and the type of role he was parodying with his appearance in Spy. There's some really talented names in the supporting cast as well and I thought many of them shone through some so-so material. Jeremy Irons brings his gravitas to the character of Wallace Westwyld. He's relatively grounded compared to some big performances from his cast mates and I enjoyed his measured take. I've always really liked Emmy Raver-Lampan in the Umbrella Academy and I think she's the overall standout in The Beekeeper. She's very serious in her early appearances (to the desired effect) but I liked her even better when she's cracking wise and trading buddy-cop barbs with her on-screen partner played by Bobby Naderi. She's definitely got one of the more fleshed out characters but she's got range and hopefully her work here will lead to more roles in movies. To my pleasant surprise, my other favourite performance was Josh Hutcherson as the unbelievably slimy Derek Danforth. This might not seem like a compliment as he's playing such a detestable character but I thought he was appropriately smarmy and unlikeable without chewing on the scenery (e.g. The admittedly fun but hammy job done by David Witts). I wouldn't have imagined Josh playing a villain but he exceeded my expectations in this role and he deserves kudos.I've mentioned the acting, the film making and the action but I have to get to the elephant in the room now. The script for The Beekeeper was shockingly inept and I kept wondering how it was greenlit in this condition? Travesty is a little dramatic but Holy Underwritten Plot & Characters Batman! Admittedly, some movies walk a fine line in tonality but not everything has to be deadly serious. There's also such things as enjoyably cheesy or deliberately hammy. I had some trouble deciding if that's what The Beekeeper is aiming for. The action scenes are unflinchingly savage and the film has a mostly-serious rhythm (the all-too-real scams, the political intrigue and government bureaucracy don't seem satirical) but then there's the tongue in cheek joking, the one-liners, the knockoff Wolf of Wall Street bravado from the villains, the constant talking about literal and metaphorical bees and over-the-top elements (a rival beekeeper whipping out a mini-gun at a crowded gas station kind of decision) that suggest it's a secret/surprise comedy. Are the filmmakers being deliberately silly? Are they in on the joke? Is The Beekeeper laughing with the audience or just missing the mark with unintentional comedic results? I couldn't really get a firm grasp on the desired tempo here but the conclusion I arrived at was that the film was serious and that the story and the script missed it's mark. The Beekeeper reminded me a little of the movie Skyscraper when it would careen into silliness. There's no doubt that parts of this movie were designed to be funny but I wasn't just laughing at those deliberate choices and I don't think that was what the creative team had in mind.I really tried to meet The Beekeeper on every level. My combined love of both David Ayer's and Jason Statham's work, an appreciation of straight-to-the-point action the movie boasts and a cast that showed up to work (extra credit to Emmy Raver-Lampman and Josh Hutcherson). I kept hoping for a gradual turnaround, a twist that would shift the narrative from bouncing between solid action to some disappointingly goofy dialogue and storytelling, or an ending that would ratchet up the proceedings. But it wasn't in the cards and while I don't disagree that The Beekeeper is a serviceable vehicle for some satisfying Statham punching & kicking but this movie could have been a lot better. I saw this with a friend in an empty theatre and we were laughing, rolling our eyes and cracking jokes throughout. I would actually like to give this team another crack at it if everyone was able to return (except Kurt Wimmer, he can just stay home). There's a lot of talent assembled here, I just think they hit a ground rule double instead of a home run. Check The Beekeeper out if you're a fan of Jason Statham or if you can tune out your inner critic and just enjoy the action.","9/10"

"capone666","17 October 2017","War for the Planet of the ApesIn a society run by apes you can rest assured only evolution will be taught in school.Still, there are a few humans in this sci-fi/fantasy that favour a creationist curriculum.When a human militia led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) murders his family, the genetically enhanced simian Caesar (Andy Serkis) takes a troop of monkeys (Steve Zahn, Karin Konoval) with him on a mission of revenge.But Caesar's vengeance takes a backseat when he must liberate hundreds of his brethren from The Colonel's primate concentration camp before they are eradicated.While this heady conclusion to the reimagined Planet of the Apes franchise wears its historical influences on its sleeve, those inspirations make for a dark final act. Nevertheless, the smidgen of action, the endless nods to the original series and the CGI are definitely highpoints.Furthermore, with monkeys in charge you can rest assured bananas will never become extinct.

"captbgb","4 December 2023","Dial of Destiny has a great premise and an enjoyable first and third act, but all in all it's brought down by lazy plotting and poor writing in the 2nd act. I'm glad I watched it. It filled a void in the franchise. However, it could and should have been much better. Indy's goddaughter has no redeeming qualities through most of the movie, and she never really arcs in a meaningful way. In the third act, she acts like she finally grows a soul. Unfortunately there's no foreshadowing to make it seem anything but a convenience. She is singlemindedly all about the money for most of the movie, and her actual change of heart comes off as contrived. I found her annoying. The logic used to explain the story beats are quite unfounded and also come across as completely contrived. Worth watching if you're over 70 and couldn't wait to see Raiders when the trailers first appeared on TV. I actually went to a screening with friends who had no idea what they were going to see.","7/10"
"cardsrock","16 July 2023","I will say that this is about as good as an Indiana Jones film starring an 80 year old Harrison Ford could be. It was a bit tough to see our once great hero struggle to get around. I never really needed to see an old, bitter Indy saddle up for one last adventure, but Dial of Destiny does a decent job of making a compelling film out of that premise.There are some surprisingly emotional beats and some rousing action to balance out the ""but why"" nature of the film. PWB is a nice addition and brings some spunk and charm that Crystal Skull was missing. There's not peak Spielberg inventive action and humor here, but it's not a shell of itself either. Mangold is a very capable filmmaker and I feel like did the best he could with what he was given. The story goes in a wild direction in the last act, and while I didn't completely balk at it, I'm not sure I loved it. Mads is a solid villain and the Nazi element didn't feel too forced. Overall, the globetrotting fun is hard to deny.This film was really not necessary, however it isn't anywhere near as bas as it could have been, so that's a win I guess? Now please, I'm begging you, let Indy rest.","1/10"
"cardsrock","17 February 2023","After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out.","6/10"
"cardsrock","7 June 2023","It's truly incredible how good of a follow-up this is to one of the best comic book films ever. The fact they managed to craft this compelling of a story without it feeling forced is amazing. I was full invested in everything happening and couldn't believe the end of the film came so soon. That; however, would be the one aspect holding me back from a perfect score, as this almost feels like an incomplete film given the lack of resolution with Miles' story. However, Gwen is arguably the co-lead of the film and she gets some nice resolution with her arc.Speaking of Gwen, the visuals utilized for her world were truly out of this world. Having the colors of the world sync with her emotions really gave this a unique feel. The rest of the visuals in the film were of course exquisite as well.There are SO many nods and references to Spider-Man across media and I loved every second of it. Lord and Miller continue their impeccable track record of clever writing with genuinely funny dialogue. I hope we see more of Miguel O'Hara in the sequel, as he is a fascinating character superbly voiced by Oscar Isaac. I must also make note of the incredible score. It might be even better than the first film with its whirlwind of electric sounds and vibes.Across the Spider-Verse stands as one of the best sequels ever and one of the best comic book films of all time. I really cannot recommend this film enough if you're interested in going on an incredible multi-versal journey full of heart and soul.","6/10"
"careyesnietowan","19 May 2018","First of all, some reviewers think that whoever doesn't like the move is an idiot, obviously those people are the idiots because these are only opinions, now about the movie, I didn't watch it expecting much to be honest, there is a lot of action, more than you have seen in the other previous movies, but my problem is with the plot and how the bad guy could have easily been defeated in more than one way during the movie but obviously no, which only shows to me how greedy the movie producer are, I think many people don't care if the story is bad as long as there is action, but for other people like me this is really an insult to our intelligence. I won't waste my time and money on the next one.","4/10"

"carsonpayne-66437","3 June 2023","For only the 16th time ever, this movie gets a perfect 10/10 from me. How come? Without a doubt, Across the Spider-Verse has done something that is completely new and original while still be a sequel to a previous film.I can not imagine a single person going to see this movie and not absolutely loving it. First off, the movie is visually stunning. Each frame is a work of art while the film switches from art styles at rapid pace without distracting from the story in any way. The writers were much more bold and complex with the story this time around and it most definitely paid off. I was engaged in the storyline of every single character and could not stop imagining what a film about each person could be like. Finally, the sound was absolutely absurd! I could not believe at some points how fantastic the visuals and sound meshed together to bring the film to life.Across the Spider-Verse benefits heavily from its predecessor. With a lot less explaining needing to go on about character backstories, the whole film was an adventure and I am here for it. Even when things were needed to be explained, like the multiverse, it was done so beautifully and well. Easily the best multiverse movie that has come out and there have been many.Do yourself a favor and go watch this on the biggest screen near you. This is not something you want to miss seeing in theaters.","10/10"
"cartermain","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.10/10","9/10"
"Carycomic","15 July 2017","Sorry! I just had to get that out of my system. Now, to be serious.In terms of bringing a trilogy full circle, in a good way, this film delivered. The CGI motion capturing and voice-over dubbing were, once again, superb (especially in Andy Cirkis' case). And the writing worthy of Rod Serling's first draft script for the 1968 classic!By that, I mean the screenplay for this movie does a credible job filling in the back story gaps left behind by the original quintet of films from Apjac and 20th Century Fox. Like, for instance; how could just one thousand years of ""barbarity,"" alone, reduce Linda-- the original Nova--Harrison's people to mute hunter-gatherers? Could it have been a slower-acting, undiagnosed side-effect of the same space germ that killed off all the cats and dogs on Earth (as mentioned in CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES)? Speaking of Nova: young Amiah Miller was suitably tender to watch in her interactions with Luca and Maurice. I hope she does at least a couple more films before heading off to college in six years. And Steve Zahn provides hilarious (and occasionally much-needed) comic relief as the Ben Gunn-esque Bad Ape.Last, but not least? Let's talk about Woody Harrelson. He's come a long way since his days as the relatively unknown replacement for Nicholas Colasanto on CHEERS. And his spot-on homage, to Marlon Brando's second-most famous character, proves once and for all that this guy is just plain versatile!In short; don't waste your money on WISH UPON. Go see this flick, instead.","10/10"
"cassidyblay","1 February 2024","Just caught this movie and I've got to say, I really enjoyed it. The film is a straight shot of adrenaline, packed with the kind of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Statham, as always, delivers a powerhouse performance, embodying the role with the intensity and charisma we've come to expect from him.However, the movie wasn't without its flaws. The supporting cast left something to be desired. Their performances felt a bit superficial, lacking the depth needed to make the characters truly believable. There was one character in particular, whose reaction to her mother's death (a central plot point) felt off-more excited than devastated, which felt jarring given the context.Despite this, the film had its high points. The humor injected through some of the characters was a welcome relief, balancing out the tension with well-timed laughs. In summary, ""The Beekeeper"" nails it as an action-packed ride, thanks to Statham and the comedic moments, even if it stumbles a bit with its supporting cast.","8/10"
"castielminion1","17 February 2023","This was terrible. I've seen and liked the first two Ant Man films but wasn't fanatical about them. After this I doubt anyone will be about any more Ant Man outings.The story was all over the place and everything could have been avoided if Janet had actually had even a brief discussion about her time in the Quantum Realm. Cassie shouldn't have opened the portal I grant you, but based on the limited info Janet had given it was an empty realm. She wasn't expecting any of this and quite rightly so in my opinion.Then there were so many plot holes and bad writing decisions that I could be here all day. The one that jumped out at me was the ending. Hope comes back and she and Scott work together and kill Kang. But instead of going back through the portal (which they both know is only open for a limited time), they stand and watch Kang die- even though he can't possibly escape from the core. They stand there and watch and let it close up. Rather than have them stay there and have a major plot twist, it's all ok because Cassie opens another portal and brings them home. No jeopardy here!The side characters were forgettable- there was a guy who can read minds, a thing obsessed with having holes in his body, the leader of the resistance and weirdly, Bill Murray. The last one was shoehorned in for two reasons-
1. So they could say this was a Bill Murray film, even though he was there for less than 5 minutes.2. So they could steal his plane thing.Darren, the villain from the first film was back, but as a caricature that looked like a floating Humpty Dumptey. The villain was ok, just a shame his efforts were clouded by a poor film!The main actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere else and honestly I can't blame them. Kathryn Newton was... not great. All in all not a great film, so watch at your own risk!","6/10"

Jason statham has talent ..... why doesn't he do something that's worth watching? ?? Why is endless use of CGI considered "" film making"" . ?? A complete embarrassment to the profession. As for the story line , the most preposterous part of this "" kill the bad guy"" tale, is that, a United States president has a conscience . We would've rather seen a realistic portrayal of the crooked politician . I only watched this because my husband wanted to see it . Pretty much rolled my eyes the whole time.","10/10"
"castostarlight","29 January 2013","I'm going to go ahead and say it outright. This film flat out takes the cake for the most overrated film of the year. This is unwarranted and uninspired Oscar bate on a Hurt Locker level. For the first time in a very long time I have actually left a movie feeling I had wasted my money.You all know the plot. A boy finds himself adrift at sea with a dangerous tiger after a horrific shipwreck. At the start of the film we are subjected to a meandering and drawn-out set up for themes and characters that do not even see a reprise or conclusion before the end of the film. It really felt like this film was stretching every scene and concept to a breaking point to fill the three hour artistic precedent established by previous Oscar winners like Return of the King. It just drags and drags until we are finally privy to the main plot. But then, the films biggest problem comes to a head: the theme.The film's theme cannot even be adequately described as it lacks any focus or objectivity. It simply comes off as an overbearing theistic agenda slathered onto an unrelated story. It presents itself as a lesson about faith, but doesn't convey this message in any other fashion than saying ""I had faith and I survived, therefore you should have faith."" As a critical thinker, I simply counter the point by demonstrating that if a faithless person was put in the same position as the main character and made the same decisions (since none of these decisions were based his faith) they would have identical outcomes. There in lies the problem: the lesson is not demonstrated through means of the story or character progression. It is literally told to you every few scenes via frequent and uninspired narration. The first rule in screen writing is a simple one: Show, don't tell. After all, film is a visual medium. Apparently the screenwriter missed the memo.What else is there to say? The acting was wooden. The score was big but not memorable. The only thing I can give to the film's credit is some beautiful cinematography and an effective use of 3D. But presentation is all for naught if the story is ineffective, and Life of Pi never once managed to grab me, move me or convince me of anything. It serves only as a colossal waste of money and time; my own and Hollywood's.","10/10"
"cdjh-81125","3 July 2023","So I won't lie, this made me kind of sad. Indiana Jones as a character means so much to me, they were my childhood movies and I've been waiting for a new film since I saw Kingdom of The Crystal Skull in cinemas 15 years ago. It was my most anticipated movie of the year and one of my most anticipated of all time really and it's so sad that for me that it ended up being exceptionally middling which feels so devoid of any energy or anything that really differentiates from any of the other films in the series.Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to like in Dial of Destiny but I'm not really convinced it amounted to much in the end. The opening 20 minutes I thought were basically perfect, it emulates the style of the original trilogy really well (aside from some dodgy CGI) and it absolutely when it feels like the film is at its most energetic and passion filled. It's not gonna come as a surprise to anyone that Harrison Ford is phenomenal in this movie, he's made it no secret that Indiana Jones is the character that means the most to him and seeing his performance in this movie makes that abundantly clear. Despite his age he's still great in all the action scenes, he's still got that great comedic timing and while I thought the film needed a lot more emotional weight than it actually did he always added it whenever the script provided anything for him to work with.Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character is definitely gonna rub some people the wrong way but I have to say I fell for her character pretty quickly. I thought her and Ford had really good chemistry and she just played her character's beats so well that it never failed to charm me. Mads Mikkelsen is proven just how good he is at playing villains and I certainly thought he gave a fine performance there's nothing I found that interesting or compelling about the character. We learn about his motivations far too late and his character arc ends so abruptly that there's no where near enough time for any of his actions to have any sort of real impact.But beyond the writing of the villain my biggest issue with the movie was how it went about tackling its central theme. I only really know from interviews that James Mangold's goal for this film was to explore Indiana at an old age and the ramifications of that on his character. But beyond that I didn't think it was well executed at all in the finished film. Mangold gives us a few brief scenes after the prologue to set up these themes just to forget about them until the last 20 minutes so the character just feels adrift in his own film for most of the runtime. The 3rd act takes a pretty swing that I couldn't fully get on board with, even if I see what Mangold was going for the poor character set up just made the final emotional beats ring totally hollow for me.I also wouldn't say I was that impressed with James Mangold's direction either. Don't get me wrong I completely sympathise with having to follow someone like Steven Spielberg and based on his past films I see why he was seen as a good pick for this movie but there just wasn't that much life behind the camera. I thought all the action scenes were solid but no one set piece that really blew me away and I didn't find there to be a lot of prolonged tension or meaningful build to anything. Dial of Destiny drags pretty considerably, mostly in the 2nd act, and having watched the other films recently you realise just how tightly paced and edited they are with to-the-point run times around about the 2 hour mark. This film was just way too bloated for its own good and I didn't think the plot was anywhere near spectacular enough to justify such a running time.I'm probably coming across as more harsh than I mean to but I just wanted so much more out of this film. There's nothing about it I hated but there's only a few select things I loved and considering how much I like every other Indiana Jones film (yes all of them) that's a pretty substantial step down. I'm sure I'll watch this film again and I'll be curious to see how my opinion evolves but as of now I'm pretty disappointed in something that felt totally without any substantial vision. Too often it felt like a story that just happened to feature Indiana Jones and came across as fan fiction in all the worst ways. I'm definitely happy I got to see another one of these in a theatre, I just wish it was a lot better than it ended up being.","6/10"
"cdjh-81125","6 August 2017","Before this trilogy came around I never really considered myself to be a Planet of The Apes fan but the trilogy has reinvested this franchise by being incredibly thought provoking as well as entertaining. Not only that but every entry in this trilogy has gotten considerably better than the last and War For The Planet of The Apes continued this tradition. The first and foremost thing to talk about with this film is Andy Serkis, when the first Oscar for a motion capture performance is given out he will be the one to receive it, he was truly amazing in this movie, he portrays Caesar in much darker and more bloody thirsty way in this film than he did the last two and pulls it off with style. Every motion-capture performance in this film is nothing less than exceptional, they feel like they are supposed to; like real walking, talking Apes and there is never a moment where you don't believe that they are. I have always loved Woody Harrelson and was very excited to see what he was going to bring to this character when given the opportunity to flex his villainous muscles. He absolutely nailed it, he was fantastic as the Colonel he brought a lot of strength to this character but also a lot of vulnerability and fear that he shows in his characters quieter scenes. It's also great that the writing for his character was very good, you come to understand his motivations for his actions which is always a necessity but I could see plenty of people agreeing with him, maybe not some of his actions but his reasoning itself is not entirely wrong. I loved that this film, like the past two before it, was not afraid to go to darker places when it needed to but neither Rise or Dawn went to the places that this film did. It almost felt like a holocaust movie at times with a lot of oppressive and fearful imagery that show that these films are not just blockbuster entertainment but serious, substance filled dramas that force there viewers to think while watching them. Matt Reeves was the perfect director for this film as well as Dawn, no disrespect to Rupert Wyatt, the director of Rise but I could not imagine anyone else nailing the direction of this film like he has. This film isn't as action-packed as one might expect but when it is he shows it in all its chaotic glory, never shying away from darker images that show the war in this film for what it is: needless violence. He's also excellent at framing that tell you a lot with single images. I have no issues with the fact this film chose not to be a non stop action experience but at the same time I do wish that this film would live up to its title more. I wanted to more see the scale and consequences of this conflict more but that is only truly shown in the first 20-30 minutes before Caesar sets out on his personal quest that was a great arc for this film but I do wish more time had been put into the conflict just to better show how much Caesar and his apes hated it and wanted to see it come to an end. War For The Planet of The Apes exceeded all my expectations, while it's not a war movie like the title would have you believe it's a much more heart felt and deeper Movie that asks questions of its audience. It has immaculate direction, framing and editing, a truly fantastic villain that plays perfectly of Caesar and another stunning performance from Andy Serkis that proves he has range like no other actor working today. 9.2/10-A (Phenomenal)","10/10"
"cedricdumler","5 June 2023","Wow. An already great year for movies, just got extended by a masterpiece of filmmaking.Just as Into the Spider-Verse did before it, Across the Spider-Verse uses the audience's familiarity with Spider-Man as a consistent source of humor which makes it all flow flawlessly.I am quite frankly obsessed with this movie. There are six different animation styles featured in the film - and my goodness this is the most awe-inspiring animation I've ever seen in a film. Using stunning visuals as a way to elevate the emotion and action in every scene. Never seen the like. The voice acting is sublime (the dialogue between Miles and Gwen goes right under the skin), the characters are multi-faceted, the action sequences are electric, the music is mesmerizing and, my word, the storyline is the perfect balance of emotional depth and meticulously timed comic relief.I also love how Across the Spider-Verse balances setting up a sequel while being its own movie. Miles and Gwen have tidy and concluding arcs with enormous growth, as it still ends on a true cliffhanger. It's among the best part ones I've ever seen.This movie is pure art put on canvas, with every frame. Soulfull. A genuine love letter to Spider-Man and filmmaking itself.Note:
It's time for everyone to appreciate animated film as a true film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly demonstrates that you can't achieve and convey the same with a live-action film as with an animated film. The richness of emotions that this masterpiece conveys benefits greatly from the animation and its mesmerizing style.","10/10"

"CelluloidConnoisseur","3 June 2023","As an avid fan of the Spider-Verse franchise, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the highly anticipated sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Let me tell you, this film did not disappoint. In fact, I dare say it surpassed its predecessor and established itself as a superior film.One of the most remarkable aspects of Across the Spider-Verse is its stunning visuals. The film seamlessly incorporates various forms of animation, creating a visually breathtaking spectacle. Every frame is a work of art, and the animation is so daring and innovative that even the simplest dialogue scenes are elevated to new heights.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance its visual extravaganza with a smart, character-driven story. It explores themes of fate, friendship, and the sacrifices heroes must make. The joy of discovery and emotional generosity, which were the soul of the original Into the Spider-Verse, are still present in abundance. The film manages to be inventive, thrilling, funny, ridiculous, heartwarming, frenetic, and even sad, all at once.Across the Spider-Verse also deserves praise for its willingness to entrust its storytelling to its animation. The visuals not only enhance the story but become an integral part of it, propelling the narrative forward in unexpected ways. The film takes risks, and they pay off splendidly.The movie's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers yearning for more, and it's a bittersweet realization that we'll have to wait until March 2024 for the conclusion. Nonetheless, this film stands on its own as an instant classic. It maintains the whimsical energy of its predecessor while offering a fresh perspective with a slightly different writing lineup.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and groundbreaking animation. It raises the bar for animated films and leaves a lasting impression with its thrilling action, engaging characters, and visual splendor. This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.","10/10"
"Ceronomus","16 March 2023","We saw Quantumania last night and I enjoyed it. I'm unsure why it is getting as much negative feedback as it is. Certainly, it isn't the best of the offerings from the MCU - and I really, REALLY miss Michael Peña's Luis, but honestly? It was a fun popcorn burner.Were there a few visual effects that seemed a little ""off"" to me? Certainly. But, overall I found some of the visuals to be absolutely stunning and some of the inhabitants of the Quantum Realm (like that big single-celled predator in the beginning seemed truly inspired. I keep hearing about how the VFX suffered from the lack of skilled VFX artists due to the production of the new Black Panther movie. I just don't see it.As far as the script goes, like I said, it isn't the best entry in the MCU. But, then again, they aren't all going to be runaway blockbusters. It has already made $450M on a budget of around $200M, enough to be at least considered moderately successful - and is in no way a ""flop"".While I get that my tastes aren't everyone's (my wife found the movie a bit to derivative for her tastes), I just am not seeing what so many others apparently are.I think that Quantumania is a 3 star, middle of the road movie and there is nothing wrong with that.","8/10"

And the first 20 minutes confirm that sentiment.And to be fair, John Williams' fantastic score reminds me that I did walk into the right showing. But instead of a rousing epic, I witnessed a strange concoction of overblown ideas, baffling casting choices, plot conveniences, bad dialogue, and some of the worst written characters I can remember. Especially Helena, who's played by a talented PWB but is written to be an insufferable, pedantic braggart.There's a strange veneer that makes everything resemble something familiar. But it all feels off. Even the deepfakery produced some chuckles in the theatre.There's some fun scenes and cameos and I enjoyed the villain. But calling this an Indiana Jones movie? Maybe Illinois Jones.","8/10"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","17 February 2023","Fittingly, the Ant-Man films have always been 'smaller scale' MCU films. Much like how Ant-Man himself can grow from small to GIGANTIC, what started out as a little heist film about a divorced ex-con named Scott Lang has now become something multiverse-threateningly HUGE. While some might miss the 'smaller stakes' of the original, this is just natural progression. I've always been fond of Scott, and he remains a likeable guy who *isn't* an a-hole/egotistical jerk (unlike certain other Avengers...who shall remain lifeless), but someone who cares about others, stands up for 'the little guy' and does what needs to be done for the greater good even if it means self-sacrifice. Although at the start of this film he's basking in the warm glowing warming glow of the fame that comes with being an Avenger, he remains NOT a jerk thanks to his family who bring him back down to Earth/keep him grounded. This includes his daughter, Cassie (whose life he missed out on 5 years of thanks to being stuck in the Quantum Realm), Hope van Dyne (who he's got a good relationship going on with) and her parents, Hank Pym & Janet van Dyne.When Cassie, who proves herself quite adept at SCIENCE like Hank, unintentionally causes a signal to contact someone from Janet's past in the Quantum Realm...the family of five gets sucked into it. The journey's as trippy as you'd expect, and if nothing else, the Quantum Realm allows for craziness UP THE WAZOO, as we're treated to all manner of weird and wonderful sights including truly bizarre flora and fauna, living buildings (that are suspiciously phallic-like in appearance) with tentacles, a past character we thought lost who's undergone some interesting changes...and Bill Murray (basically playing Bill Murray). Last time Janet was here, she unwittingly helped someone who turned out to be Kang the Conqueror. He was banished (which she didn't know until *after* she'd helped him) and almost got free, but she trapped both herself and him in there until she was freed in the second movie. Now she's back, he wants a gizmo that she made unusable (thanks to those helpful Pym Particles) put right again so he can use it to escape and destroy the multiverse or whatever...you know, the usual bad guy life goals.Scott finally gets some bonding time with his daughter, though probably not quite in the way he was hoping for. At one point he utters that instantly iconic line from the trailer: ""I don't have to win...we both just have to lose."" as he's getting beaten, and that's what I think makes Scott Lang/Ant-Man a true hero. Although he's fighting a battle he can't possibly win against an all-powerful enemy, he's willing to remain defiant/fight for the people he loves (as well as everyone else) until his last breath. Also, Paul Rudd's just so easily likeable as Scott. Meanwhile, Hope (Evangeline Lilly, sporting a new super-short 'do. It's more 'practical' for fighting...but I preferred her previous hair) remains Ant-Man's equal as the Wasp when it comes to mastering the shrinking/enlarging fighting-style. These two have been through a lot and it's nice to see them working together like a well-oiled machine. She and Ant-Man are true partners, helping/saving each other at various times, and Hope proves herself just as selfless as Scott towards the film's end.Cassie (previously played by Emma Fuhrmann, who I personally thought did a lot with a little during her all-too-brief appearance in Avengers: Endgame, managing to create a very *real* effectively emotional moment with Rudd during their reunion scene), has been recast with Kathryn Newton (who's come a long way since her recurring role on the TV series Supernatural among other things). This version of Cassie is clearly smart...except when she isn't, but that's not really her fault since she didn't have all the necessary information to prevent her mistake she makes at the start of the movie (when will MCU characters learn that keeping secrets is BAD?). In between father-daughter-bonding, with occasional typical moody teen behaviour and getting in on the action with a suit of her own (she can handle herself in a fight just like the others), Cassie at least *admits* to her mistakes/tries to make up for them. She's certainly not the worst of the 'younger' generation of characters we've met in the MCU thus far.As for the 'older' generation, Hank/Janet (along with Hope) catch up on the time they lost together as a family in amongst all the craziness going on. They each have a role to play/get to be awesome in their own ways (Hope's aforementioned kicking butt, Hank coming to the rescue at a pivotal moment and Janet handling herself admirably without the aid of a suit). Michelle Pfeiffer especially gets to shine, as we see the weight of what Janet's been carrying with her all this time and she goes toe-to-toe/holds her own against the film's villain (make no mistake, he *is* the VILLAIN. No sob story excuses killing trillions, which Janet rightly points out to him). I've seen much praise for Jonathan Majors' performance as Kang, and I'll admit that when I watched the first trailer for the movie, he did give off a quietly menacing vibe that was rather effective (better than those OTT villains who have to YELL all their lines). However, his taking-a-really-long-time-to-say-anything-and-get-to-the-point (he's like an Ent that way) got rather old/tiresome after a while and I think some have overpraised him a bit by claiming he's the 'best part' of the movie. He's a formidable foe...but still one I wanted to see Scott defeat.There's been conflicting opinions about this film, some praising it and others condemning it (yes, there's lots of CGI...but that's to be expected given they're in the QUANTUM REALM). While it does go overboard at times, that's par for the course. It's still a decent entry in the story of possibly the most underappreciated Avenger in the MCU and it definitely feels like there's more to tell.","7/10"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","24 April 2019","Well...most of them.The film opens on Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye with his happy family...until he no longer has one on account of them being dusted, which causes him to become vengeful Mohawkeye. Next up it's my least favourite Avenger, Tony Snark, teaching games to Nebula (my favourite Guardian of the Galaxy and the only one of those a-holes I actually LIKE. Mantis, who I also like and who *isn't* an a-hole, sadly only gets one line in the movie, but at least it's a funny one). The term drawn-out could be used to describe this whole opening with Tony. 'Self-indulgent' would be another. Just because you have a 3-hour+ runtime, Russos, doesn't mean you should waste it lingering on Tony sleeping, etc. I did appreciate, though, that Nebula shows she's grown (as evidenced by the fact she's refrained from beating the snot out of Tony the entire time they've been stuck in space together). I was happy to see her featured so much.Thankfully things finally get moving once Captain Marvel saves their butts and interacts with the team in a scene most have probably watched already. As she points out to Rhodey Rude (whose main role seems to be Joke/Movie Reference Man), she's been on other planets after 'The Snap' that *didn't* have The Avengers to help them out. The fact that THOR says he likes her should be enough (though obviously won't be for certain people). He also learns from the mistake he made at the end of Infinity War regarding what bodypart to aim for on Thanos (who apparently wiped out half the universe's populace so he could become a farmer and unfortunately destroyed the Infinity Stones). Too bad Nebula's robbed of the chance to end Thanos in this movie (twice!), as she probably deserved to the most. Tony the Drama Queen proves he hasn't grown at all, laying the blame for everything at Cap's feet.A skip to five years later reveals time hasn't been kind to Thor. I'm saddened to see him reduced to this joke, when the first Thor movie is one of my favourites. They've veered too far into 'comedy' for my taste, as here he's played mostly for laughs on account of letting himself go (for those wanting shirtless Thor, you'll get him...though you'll wish you *hadn't*). Bless Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, as he brings a breath of fresh air to proceedings. His reunion with his (now grown) daughter is one of the few genuinely effective emotional moments in the film. Unfortunately, he's not given the respect he deserves, considering he's the one to come up with the idea of time travel (the subject of which is given the ultimate nerd discussion in this film). They go to Tony, who selfishly refuses to help the others get back everyone they lost since he already HAS everyone HE wants (well...except for Spider-Kid, who is the reason he eventually changes his mind).Cut to after a 'comedic' sequence involving working out the kinks of time-travelling, the gang splits up to retrieve all the stones from the past. This is where the film kicks into gear, as we revisit past MCU films and encounter previous versions of characters. Highlights include: Cap seeing Peggy Carter again, Cap vs Past Cap, Thor spending some precious time with his soon-to-be-deceased mother (plus, a Jane cameo! There's actually lots of cameos in the film, but only a few I cared about) and twice the amount of Nebula. There's one rage-inducing consequence of visiting the past involving Mohawkeye, Natasha and the Soul Stone. If you remember what happened with Gamora, you'll know what that means. Although the character who ends up being the sacrifice gets some good character/emotional beats in this film, it still doesn't make up for the fact they're unceremoniously given the 'permadeath' treatment, thus robbing us of one of the MCU's best characters and the awesome dynamics between them and other characters. Given all the others that could've been offed, WHY'd it have to be...well...you'll see.I'll give the film credit for seamlessly blending the 'present' characters with the past, and once things reach the climax, they definitely ensure this is the most 'epic' battle we've seen yet which involves pretty much every character (except those who're unfortunate enough to *stay* dead, of course), some of which will be getting future films or TV shows to appear in. I guess that's meant to 'make up for' them not getting much screentime here (like my fave, Wanda. At least she gets some revenge on Thanos and shares an emotional moment with Mohawkeye near the end. I'm looking forward to her show and hopefully future movie appearances too). Captain America gets at least two cheer-worthy moments, while Captain Marvel and her new haircut get to kick some major arse (don't fret, haters...she isn't given the final victory over Thanos. No, we all know who gets THAT privilege).I guess I was supposed to feel sad near the end, but honestly I just felt relief, as it's about time a certain someone faced some actual real consequences. Hopefully other characters will get to thrive/have substantial screentime now that somebody isn't hogging it all. Another good thing about the end is the camera shot which slowly moves through/covers everyone (all these characters we've come to know, plus a few we haven't yet) at the funeral. The BEST part, however, is the final scene. I've waited ever since the first Cap movie (my other fave MCU film) to get to the scene that ends this movie, and I think it's worth it. I'm so very happy with it and who it involves.While there're no mid-credits/post-credits scenes, it's worth sticking around to see the original six Avengers actors literally signing off. It'll probably take a couple of viewings to fully digest this film, as it throws in everything AND the kitchen sink. It's a fitting conclusion to Phase 3 (ignoring Spider-Kid 2). Now, bring on Phase 4!","10/10"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7 August 2023","As if it weren't bad enough that Disney stubbornly refuses to release any of the MCU TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray anywhere in the world, now they've made it personal by announcing they're discontinuing DVDs/Blu-rays of *anything* being released in my country (and ONLY my country), with their final release being GotG Vol. 3 (seriously, they couldn't have made it something I'd actually want to watch?). So, if I wanted to see this movie, my options were wait several years for it to be on TV (I could've been DEAD by then!) or go see it at the theatre. Normally I'd have gone on opening day, but wasn't able to. After that, I wasn't feeling overly motivated to and was just going to wait for it on DVD/Blu-ray...but thanks to Disney, I no longer had that option. There's been much debate over CGI de-aging of actors, but it was fine here with Harrison Ford's Indy in a longer-than-expected flashback. Obviously they felt the de-aging would hold up to scrutiny, and for the most part it does (there were only a couple of times it felt slightly off). Toby Jones plays Basil Shaw, another in an apparently long line of Indy offsiders (and kind of useless...until he finally isn't). What surprised me was how not-terribly-exciting I found the whole opening sequence. While there's thankfully no 'nuke the fridge' moment, it stretches credulity how Indy miraculously survives being thrown about and an explosion directly beneath him whilst his neck's in a noose.Sadly, things don't get interesting until a good way through the movie. Before that, we catch up with old man Indy, who yells at his noisy neighbours, baseball bat in hand (I can relate), and is unaware that the only person attending his classes who actually KNOWS ANYTHING is his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), wishing to pick up where her father left off in search of this film's MacGuffin, the Antikythera (designed by Archimedes). After she reintroduces herself to Indy, it's not long before she's leaving him behind at the mercy of bad guys. While there is some action involving a parade and Indy riding a horse, I personally felt things didn't really get going until the scene that begins at a Tangier hotel, where Helena's attempting to auction off the half of the Dial she nicked. Regarding their two characters, I did feel they had a decent dynamic going on between them and Helena/Waller-Bridge isn't nearly as annoying as Willie was in Temple of Doom. People like to exaggerate the 'feminism' stuff, but she's just as 'feisty' as Marion was and has her moments where she acknowledges she's said/done something wrong. One of very few 'emotional' moments in the movie is during a scene where she asks what Indy would do if he could go back in time (which turns out to be the Antikythera's power) and he talks about the death of his son, Mutt (as if you needed more reason to watch this film, Shia LaBeoufhead's irritating character from the last movie unceremoniously being killed offscreen should be motivation enough. No more crappy CGI vine-swinging alongside monkeys for him!).While the character of Teddy (this film's version of Short Round, who some people are making out Teddy can't hold a candle to...but I think they're forgetting just how thoroughly annoying that kid was and are only forgiving of him now because the actor who played him grew up to kick butt in Everything Everywhere All At Once and won an Oscar) isn't really necessary, at least he proves himself *useful* (just don't bother questioning how this thief can fly a plane with no prior experience) and doesn't YELL ALL HIS LINES like Short Round did. It's too bad Sallah wasn't the third member of the team instead (while it's good to see John Rhys-Davies return in the role, he's out of the movie pretty quick and only returns at the very end). Still, at least he doesn't feel as wasted as Antonio Banderas does playing yet another old friend of Indy's. What was the point of him exactly? Same can be said for Mason, the most unlikely FBI Agent to be working with German scientist/astrophysicist and ""former"" Nazi, Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen, who can basically play a villain in his sleep by this point). Rather than so many side characters, I think the movie would've been better to just focus on Indy and Helena's relationship, as it seems like we're only just getting a feel for them as a pair by the time the film reaches its conclusion.Speaking of...yes, there *is* time-travel involved (and yet it's still somehow easier to swallow than aliens). There have been eyeroll-worthy objections to Helena 'robbing Indy of his agency' in the scene where he just wishes to be left to die in the past (after actually meeting Archimedes himself), but Indy was being a stubborn fool who was risking screwing up reality, so her punching his lights out to get him back to his time was warranted. Likewise, people may be disappointed that the baddie doesn't suffer a horrific fate like main villains of the past films, but it's more about him realising how screwed his grand plan is (and, hey, if that isn't enough...we see his crispified corpse later). In the end, things are made 'right' again when Indy gets back together with Marion (complete with callback), after their marriage fell apart following Mutt's death. Anyone worrying about Helena taking over from Indy needn't get their panties in a bunch if the final shot of him snatching his iconic fedora off a clothesline is any indication. While this movie certainly doesn't reach the 'classic' status of Raiders or Last Crusade, the best praise I can give it is that at least it's not as ridiculous as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which, much like the Star Wars prequels, it seems people are now pretending is some misunderstood masterpiece) or as gross as Temple of Doom. It's not 'bad'...just kinda boring.","9/10"
"Chance_Boudreaux19","4 March 2023","The MCU in its current state is an absolute mess. Up until Endgame the whole series of movies felt like it lead up to something and now it's all over the place. Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania was supposed to introduce the next big bad that the Avengers will face in the form of Kang The Conqueror and I guess it did. First of all, Jonathan Majors plays the role well but the character itself seems like a total wimp. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful Kang variants and yet he gets trapped (maybe killed?) by Ant-Man and the Wasp without any sacrifice. Now, if the movie had the audacity to sacrifice both titular characters in order for them to stop Kang from escaping the Quantumverse it would've worked better but as it stands the movie takes no risks and has the villain defeated by characters that aren't even that powerful. After all that how are we as the audience supposed to believe that this guy can be a threat to more powerful Avengers like Thor or Dr Strange. On the other hand, if the movie did sacrifice any of the major characters it still wouldn't change how I feel about it. In fact, it would've maybe been a waste to sacrifice Ant-Man in such a bland and uninteresting film.The whole thing feels so dull and lifeless that I could not concentrate on what was going on. I was so bored I found myself switching off at various points throughout. Scorcese compared these movies to amusement parks but I wish it was that. I wish it produced moments that would have me entertained but instead it feels on the same level as Morbius. It's certainly more competent than that pile of garbage but I was equally bored whilst watching either of them. On top of that, the characters make nonsensical decisions that I'm supposed to buy without thinking too much about like Michelle Pfeiffer not telling anyone about Kang. Moreover, it's not funny and in general I'm tired of the quippy, inconsequential dross that Marvel is spewing out. Maybe, I'm not the audience for these movies anymore but I don't go into them wanting to dislike them. I want to feel the highs that the Infinity Saga provided again but I don't see it happening. With the exception of No Way Home none of the movies since Endgame have been great and at best they've been mildly entertaining. I also haven't watched any of the MCU shows yet and I'm not planning to because I don't want Marvel to be such a major part of my life, there's too much great cinema out there to devote this much time to something so mediocre. The highest praise I can give Ant-Man and the Wasp is that it's inoffensive and relatively short, although it felt long for me. Also, the performances from Majors, Paul Rudd and others are good. Apart from that, it's just a cookie-cutter husk of a film that looks incredibly artificial and is only designed to set up future events and to sell you on watching more of the current MCU's endless trash content.","7/10"
"chand-suhas","1 June 2023","The sequel to the 2018 gem packs enough to match the hype created. This time Miles' Spider-Man gets his own nemesis, going by the name The Spot. The teenager tries hard to get his parents to ground him while triggering the nemesis with his humor. He misses Gwen who has joined the Spider Society and like any teenager, he wants Gwen and wants to be part of the society. How much of a serious threat The Spot gets to be and what does it cost to Miles' to save the spider-verse forms rest of the story.First, the visuals stand out again and the archival footages too got more cheers. They indeed set up the story well for Beyond the Spider-Verse. However, the plot felt overstuffed and since the final act was meant for setting up the story for the sequel, it simply drags on predictably. The stereotypical Mumbattan episode aside, the action and humor kept things engaging. Since the first movie went bonkers in it's final act, the sequel fell way short compared to that.","3/10"
"chand-suhas","21 January 2024","The entire plot got revealed in the trailer itself. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) plays the beekeeper, who knows to protect the hive. He is humbled by how Eloise Parker treats him. When Eloise gets scammed to lose all her savings, resulting in her death, the beekeeper makes it his mission to hunt down the ones responsible. From one company to another, following the money, the beekeeper remains unstoppable. How he uncovers the brains behind the scam and exact his form of justice forms rest of the story.In a way this can be called Jason Statham's own John Wick and 45mins into the film, they even show a glimpse of what could be the crazy Beekeepers world would be, if they make a sequel. It's a basic screenplay and David Ayer doesn't falter a bit in narrating an engaging story amidst all the action. It's over the top from the word go and a larger than life action star, carrying the film with his mere screen presence. Thought the reveal was predictable, the build up provided till the Boston fight scene and ofcourse the climax action scene, works well. The Beekeeper is a fun one time watch and a far better Jason Satham film since Wrath of Man.","8/10"
"chaos-rampant","13 February 2013","Films usually work upon the same mechanisms, it is what religion in old times simply used to warn against. In more typical dramas, the sin is acted out as some part of life, the more recognizable the better. This was fine for centuries, but the invention of the camera opened it up in great ways. More ambitious films visualize the experience or feeling as it arises, more or less vividly render the hell of it (think Lynch), usually with some the ambiguity and mystery it happens in real life.This is midway between the two ways.Framed with religion and the search for answers, the story here is of a young boy on a spiritual journey with his animal self. The boy has previously adopted religion, several in fact, and this deeper perspective he cultivates is the film we see. On a simple level, it is a story of survival, but so extraordinary that you know there's more to it, hidden depths. Visualized around him, we have a series of meditations inspired by the elements—in tempestuous seas, in the whale magnificent to behold but wrecks everything, in the magical, by day, inter- connected nature of the island but turns deadly by night.Visually, the experience has been more evocatively done in Tropical Malady, which is on the same journey to inner self (once more a tiger) and clarity. Greenaway has more puzzling symmetries. But it's a nice film to have, perhaps too clean and cutesy, but clean for a reason.Here's the caveat. The idea so simplified in the end, is that we can't know one way or the other, but here we are, loved ones perish, we continue to be tossed in an ocean of suffering, and that god is perhaps the more attractive story to grim reality, it provides purpose and color, soothes the soul on her journey. This explains the Disney cleanliness, as his mind not dwelling on death.The sentiment makes sense of course, but suddenly reduces.Going back, you will see this reductive logic in places, reductive because it IS logic. The most telling spot for me is the following, it is the one that should be the most emotionally powerful moment in the film, the most purely visual because it is directly of the boy's soul. Among the visual meditations, there is the one of him being submerged in the sea to the quantum level of soul where images bubble up and form everything else, he goes past the animals, past the symbols, and settles on the face of his loved one, all of it illusory.It is of course the feeling that has arisen in him, but see how it is rendered. Schematic isn't it?Not unlike its notion of god, which reduces in retrospect by too simple sense. So keep this film to heart, it has its heart in the right place, but imagine how you would do the swim. Zen starry waters without the Disney luminescence maybe? I have similar issues with Koyannisqatsi's constructed nature.The magic in it being what it is, not constructed, revelatory as it is.","8/10"

"charmingkostas","24 January 2019","The announcement of this film brought back some long-forgotten memories. It was a few years back, when the Battle of Gods was announced, triggering tsunamis of excitement from long-time fans of the Dragon Ball series.Yet, the final product was bland, and failed to deliver; more or less like what happened with the follow-up film, ""Revival F"". There was promise, but the execution was poor. Then, we welcomed the new Dragon Ball series, some fifteen years after the end of Dragon Ball Z. We stayed with it, till its finale last March, and an anoouncement of an action-packed film that would focus on the past of Sayans. Again, more promises.Only, this time, things are different. To be honest, the part of the film that deals with the events of the past could have been omitted. After all, the star of the film is Broly. A Broly who is far from the caricature that was presented in the DBZ films. This Broly has feelings and emotions. This Broly is ready to fight, in order to protect those he cares about. This Broly is an absolute beast, a brute - yet only because he is confused. He's trying to survive in an unfamiliar place, misled by the revenge-driven villains of the film.But all these facts can only guarantee one thing; that we are treated to almost an hour of intense fighting, superbly executed and fluid animated scenes, humoristic instances and moments we feel like we can't take any more of what we see. The plot's role is to provide a (solid) background to the immense action, something which is good for newcomes, but a tad tasteless to old-time fans.Voice acting from the Funimation legends is top-notch, whereas the score gives some thrilling vibes, with it being repetitive at some points and lacking the epicness of Sumitomo's work in the past films and the recent series.Overall, Dragon Ball Super: Broly brings back all the things that led the series to stardom and to being part of the popular culture for the past 30+ years. Fans following the series are sure to spot a few things they might not totally enjoy here and there. However, people who are planning to see the movie are due to a fantastic experience, that pays tribute to the series and brings promise to whatever comes up next.","1/10"

"chatless46","25 November 2012","On its face, this is a ripping yarn about survival at sea, based on a novel by Canadian Yann Martel. The book version is astonishing, and the film version is literally jaw-dropping both because of its visual effects and because of its faithfulness to the source material.The novel blurs the line between ""fact"" and fiction, beginning with the author's note describing his pursuit of a good story, a pursuit that lands him in Pondicherry, India. There he hears of a tale that, he is told, is God-affirming. The protagonist and narrator of the story, a native Pondicherrian by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel, now lives in Martel's homeland. Martel returns to find him in Toronto. This is where the film begins, and pretty much continues in lockstep with the book.The story supposedly told to Martel by Pi Patel unfolds intriguingly from his childhood in India to his voyage at sea with his family, through tragedy and finally, to salvation. The story is infused with humor, horror, beauty, and seamanship, all aided by stunningly vivid images. At the end, the viewer and the author face a choice that may affirm theism in some, and yet allow nonbelievers to reject it.What is hard to reject is the unutterable beauty and flash of the story, and the skillful way director Ang Lee has captured it on film. Convincing performances by Suraj Sharma as the teenage Pi and Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi are stellar. No less convincing is the rendition of leading feline Richard Parker, a creation that may make you wonder where digital technology is leading us.Most movies, and fiction in general, require suspension of disbelief. In that sense, ""Life of Pi"" can be a challenge. That said, this film breaks new ground as terrific entertainment.","1/10"

"chenp-54708","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun.","5/10"

While its strength lies in the likable performances from Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, the film's plot feels disjointed and lacks the same cleverness and humor that characterized the previous Ant-Man entries. Cinematography is serviceable but doesn't offer any memorable visual spectacles, and the music and visuals, while competent, do little to enhance the overall experience.

The film's editing expertly weaves together multiple storylines and character arcs, making its three-hour runtime feel like a sprint. The strength of ""Endgame"" lies in its ability to deliver a satisfying conclusion to over a decade of storytelling while still introducing thrilling new elements. The weakness? Well, it might be a bit overwhelming for those not well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The music enhances every epic moment, and the cinematography captures both the grandeur of the battles and the intimacy of the character interactions. Above all, ""Endgame"" carries a profound message about sacrifice, resilience, and the enduring power of hope. This is superhero cinema at its absolute finest.","10/10"
"cherold","20 September 2023","Director James Mangold made the gutsy decision to go head to head with Raiders of the Lost Arc in the first sequence, where a de-aged Harrison Ford (great tech!) gets an old-fashioned chase scene. And right away, it's clear this is not a Spielberg film. It's less that the action is a little muddled than that there's nothing memorable. Even the best bit with the big gun doesn't dazzle the way it should.Spielberg, even now, even in his weakest movies, always has something that makes you sit up and take notice. Had he directed this, there would have been a moment where you said, cool!Flash-forward to an aging Indiana Jones getting annoyed at his hippie neighbors, retiring from teaching, and encountering Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Helena, ready to drag him back into adventure.The premise is fine and there's a good deal of good-enough action and adventure involving Nazis and the central, sci-fi themed McGuffin, the Dial of Destiny. But the most notable moment in any of it is a brief callback to the original movie.The movie also tends to skitter over its ideas instead of diving in. Indie is old, but he still does all sorts of young-person action things. The CIA does awful things but it's just a plot device. This movie never wants you to think it might actually be *about* something.Still, it's all decent enough until we finally learn the Nazi plan for the Dial of Destiny, which is *remarkably* idiotic. Not only that, but every advantage the Nazis could use to pursue this plan - they do the opposite. And the sci-fi concept is absurd on multiple levels, like something out of Axe Cop. It's hard to explain how stupid it is without diving into spoilers, so I won't, but OMG.The funny thing is, I don't consider this the worst Indy movie. That would be Temple of Doom. But for all its flaws, the first two scenes of Temple of Doom were brilliant and the mine cart scene was really good. Dial of Destiny doesn't have anything as terrible as the worst of Temple of Doom (except the Nazi plan, which is mind-boggling but also a small part of the film), but it doesn't have anything as glorious as diamonds and ice skittering across the floor.When Spielberg decided he didn't want to direct this they should have pulled the plug. This is perfectly watchable, but it's no more than that, and wasn't blowing the dust off Indy to take him out for one last spin.I don't recommend watching this, although honestly if you're a fan of the series you'll probably do what I did and ignore the bad reviews and watch it anyway. Just don't say you weren't warned.","1/10"
"chessa-75654","20 September 2023","At first I loved it. Harrison is brilliant even in CGI & the beginning was an Indy movie. I smiled the whole 15 minutes. And then it becomes Logan, depressing & angsty but without a loveable costar when Sallah is left behind. Then it's a ridiculously long chase scene as the uninspiring despicable god- daughter hogs the story with her side-kick street kid. Shades of the aptly named Temple of Doom annoyance levels without the laughs.Mads was his usual expressionless character, which actually worked well for the obsessed Nazi he portrayed. Great scenery, sets & music. The look of the movie is great until the past sequence! I Love the globe trotting adventures of an Indy film. And time travel is something crazy Indy might encounter but it's almost a hiccup in the film & the CGI in the sequence was awful! On top of that Indy gets there, gets a shoulder wound & just wants to give up? Indy never gives up! I needed Indy to be Indy.I certainly didn't need the included sad sack reality check into this character's storyline - the war killed his rebellious kid & grief destroyed marriage injection. GeeZ what a downer! Rip roaring feel-good adventure movies don't go there! Please, where are the creatives who could have written a soaring farewell for Indy.As for Helena Shaw, who writes these awful, materialistic, annoying women characters? Please stop. Indy & Sallah & Marion was the farewell movie I wanted.So this is a mixed bag of good & bad with it's best lying in aspects of it almost being an Indiana Jones movie & it's worst making it miss the mark. Sorry I invested. I liked Crystal Skull better & even the supremely annoying Temple of Doom. I'll always miss the Indiana Jones of Raiders of the Lost Ark & The Last Crusade & grateful for those wild rides!","8/10"
"chgames-28385","23 February 2023","Let's start out with this, I had no big expectations for this Marvel film like I did with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and there was a reason why. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, plus I wasn't a big Ant-Man fan to even begin with . . . The previous Ant-Man movies didn't leave much lasting impressions on me, and I was meh about the whole series and the superhero in genreal. So when I heard that this movie was coming out, well of course I was going to see it opening weekend just so I could be on top of the game of seeing it, and not being ruined by the movie. I wasn't seeing this because I was really interested into it . . . Not really, anyhow. But after watching this movie twice in theaters the same day, I can say this: it falls short of what I was hoping it would be, but it deliver a solid set up for Phase 5!I'm not really into the Multiverse, Time Variants, and the Quantum Realm because they just make not only my heard hurt just thinking too much of them, but it makes the MCU timeline even more confusing (than it should be). So to begin with, I wasn't into the Quantum Realm so I could care less if they explored it or not, or if they got trapped in it or not. It was just another big expansion on the MCU side just to get more revenue in, is how I see it. But after watching this movie, I guess you could say it got me to enjoy the Quantum Realm a tad bit better, and fully appreciate all the bright visuals and colors they did to make the Quantum come alive. I mean, beautiful world an all, but I could still care less.This movie sets up not only Phase 5 very well, but the villain for it quite amazingly! If you're like me, you could agree that Phase 4 was a very weak and if I'm going to be honest, a bit unneeded Phase. The only two movies that carried the whole Phase 4 on its back was Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. No other mentionable movie that was released during Phase 4 made the best impression (although: Doctor Strange 2 could make it). So after an exhaustable Phase 4, we finally move on to I hope a better Phase, Phase 5. Now look, if Marvel/Disney does this right, Phase 5 could be the most interesting Phase since Phase 3!Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania by itself was a decent, average movie that had its moments while also having their cringy moments also. But for the beginning/start-up of Phase 5, not going to lie: it sets up Phase 5 very well. We get introduced to not exactly the most menacing/mean villain of all time, but it's the powers he has and its the other variants of him that just may make Phase 5 villain(s) the most interesting to watch . . . To see how Marvel and Disney unfolds his intentions, his powers, and the affect he'll have in the MCU timeline (that is, if they do it right of course). Kang was an interesting villian in this movie . . . He was played by a Johnathon Majors who actually did a great job, so I'm excited to see more of him in later Marvel films. Johnathon Majors has potential in the MCU, and if Marvel and Disney does it right, it may just be the biggest role Johnathon has played in his movie career . . . Or it could be the somewhat of a downfall, just depending on how Marvel and Disney plays out Kang.But Ant-Man just being a standalone movie in its series does farily alright. I think the beginning struggled to catch my attention. I think the first time watching it I was just waiting for Kang to appear on the screen, and kind of caring less of what playing at the moment. People/Critics alike raved about Johnathon Majors' performance, so of course I wanted to see if hey did actually a good job . . . And after watching it, I think he did a great job! But this movie has some interesting points that they brought to the table; maybe I could have taken the whole thing serisously if the 3rd act of the movie didn't just go a bit out of hand. I felt like the 3rd act of the movie was the downfall of the movie. It's just got a bit out of hand and that cringy speech in that movie didn't help at the least.The 1st and 2nd act were interesting enough, but my favorite moments were when we were trying to understand the villian Kang a bit more. He was easily the best part about the movie, and outshadowing everyone's elses role in the movie, and not lying here. He's just a villian we have never gotten before, so I'm interested on how they're going to handle Kang, and he might be one of my favorite villians that has been brought to big screen. The other characters in the movie that weren't main characters like Scott and Hope, were more or less so unmemorable and they were in the shawdows in a lot of the movie. So basically, any characters in the movie that didn't have a big role were sidelined people who were underused in the movie.M. O. D. O. K. Was the worst character in the movie and also one of the most unneeded too. I struggled to comprehend/digest him fully, and to be honest I could really care less about him. He wasn't an annoying character, he was just one that made me question why we even have him in the movie to begin with. But besides that character, this movie undergoes a lot of underused characters, and more or less put them in the shadows. Really unfortunate that we didn't get to understand these people in the Quantman Realm more.Besides some questionable choices for the movie, a cringy speech, a 3rd act getting a bit out of hand, characters being underused, and a character not needed, this movie is a bit solid. For being a standalone Ant-Man movie it was okay, but for setting up Phase 5 and its villian, it did a great job! It was a movie that I enjoyed more on my secondtime and understood more. It's not I would want to see over and over, but it's one that I'm glad I saw how they setted up Phase 5!","2/10"
"Chi-C-Dawg","30 June 2023","I REALLY enjoyed it, and even loved it at times. A huge improvement over the last one. It definitely is a more mature Indy and a more mature film. It looks darker like more modern cinema, but the story is fun and full of surprises. I will say it drags a little and could have been tightened, but the story is at least coherent compared to Crystal Skull, annd I never didn't enjoy my time in this film. Overall, I had a blast and it was touching. It was nice in a way that it tried to honor rather than capture the magic of the first three movies and really the power of nostalgia. Those movies LOOK and feel different. We've all moved on from there and this movie kind of does too. A good ending.Also some sexy henchman and sailors in this one.","2/10"
"Chiller7","30 November 2017","Here's a movie that I'll give a high rating because it's technically well made, but I can't actually say it's my kind of movie. I like having a good time watching movies. I liked the previous two movies in this franchise. This one though, War for the Planet of the Apes, was more of a depressing experience. It's a dreary story full of cruel people (& apes) doing horrible things to each other and treating each other badly. It's the ape version of a concentration camp/holocaust movie, for those of you into that kind of thing. It's not for me, but that's just my taste, so I won't fault the movie for that.Where I can fairly subtract a couple of points from my rating would be some of the dumb decisions and illogical behavior made by some of the people made throughout the movie. Both humans and apes keep making bad decisions that get their own sides in trouble. For instance, we see here, once again, the dumb prison guard trope. Somehow, the one guy tasked with guarding a jail in movies always has to conveniently be the dumbest guy on Earth. It's frustrating to watch characters being that stupid and comes off as lazy writing.Don't get me wrong; the movie's not all bad. Excellent CGI, for instance. The quality of digital trickery has reached such levels that it's hard to even accept that those aren't real apes on screen. It's pretty impressive.","4/10"

"chris_rowe-881-168820","30 June 2023","I'm extremely tired of seeing endless franchises rehashed, reimagined or just remade, or completely unnecessarily added to and this is the latest example. I took my dad for a belated Father's Day and this was the completion of seeing each film on launch day, which was cool.Let's start with the obvious, casting, it was awful, from the friend played by the usually great Toby Jones, he seemed the wrong fit for bumbling charming professional. But it gets far worse, the young lad was awful, his acting was genuinely terrible and I don't care he's young, I've seen so many phenomenal kid performances in this age that at this level, his performance was just not good.Then we have PWB, a woman who made 12 episodes of a tedious self absorbed sitcom that got massively overrated, she may have talent behind the screens, but her acting roles have been the posh girl in most things, so to keep celebrating her as a top actress is ridiculous, she plays 1 type of character and is completely impossible to like. Her confidence/ego we're obnoxious, her delivery is tedious and trying to act like she's 30 is ridiculous. She's 37 looking 40s. Completely the wrong cast and took away from what should've been a farewell, stealing the attention for what? A spin off? Was just groan inducing. I'll throw in that PWB is the most overhyped and overrated in this milenium.HF must've been really talked into this as either a vehicle to have a woman lead or just desperation from people who want money, he struggled with delivery, clearly wasn't mobile to a huge degree and this is no knock on him and his age but it made this film look a bit naff. That cgi young body they do is creepy and looks awful, from will smith to manifest, it looks rotten and unnatural. It was a lacklustre and pointless stain on a trilogy many find iconic.The ending, it was genuinely insane and spat all over logic, credibility and realism. Whilst I'm not knocking some of the science, this was written in the hope people will just smile and take it. It was nonsense, I mean the 1 in a billion chance they end up at that time aside, the fact that someone like indi wouldn't ruin history or alter things intentionally suddenly stay knowing it'd destroy history is ridiculous.Then the villain who's intelligent even though evil is so suddenly idiotic he mistakes that for the exact time in Sicily he wanted was just lazy, it would look nothing alike, it was done for the audience benefit and took away again from credibility and logic.This film is awful, it feels so so long, it drags, misses the mark and the writing is abysmal, some of the dialogue was just unforgivable and the casting killed any funny/warm or positive moments you expect in these adventures. Anyone who tells you this is good, doesn't have high standards for entertainment or quality.","7/10"
"chris_rowe-881-168820","8 June 2023","People are so insanely creative and talented, I mean I love superhero movies and animated ones but this is next level. The story is brilliant, the humour is great but there's so much to it, there's literally emotions being shown to you via art, colours and textures, it's phenomenally deep and nuanced for a film you'd probably write off as being a kids movie.Script is great, attention to detail is perfect sbc the links to all the other parts of the Spider-Man universes was really clever to, some hilarious cameos and a great nemesis who had the whole audience laughing.I'd actually say I now prefer these to the in real life movies.As close to perfection as possible.","9/10"
"chrisgavidia","19 February 2023","Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one.","6/10"
"christianyogendran-15663","21 August 2020","This is just my opinion, Infinity War was way better than this movie.Infinity War had a bunch of epic scenes throughout the whole 2.5 hours.

"christianyogendran-15663","9 July 2023","I loved Into the Spider Verse, I seriously have no words to describe how spectacular Across the Spider Verse was! Somehow they managed to make the second movie better than the first!Every frame of the movie is basically a work of art. It can easily be put into an art museum. I also love how they were able to put different types of animation as well, from LEGO to non-cartoon, to comic-book.The acting is also amazing, Hailee Steinfeld actually has a bigger role in the movie and I'm so thankful that Gwen Stacy was given the emotional backstory we all wanted. The actor that plays the villain Spot is also really clever as well, but the real star of the movie is Oscar Issac. I loved his character the most, he plays his role with such passion that I've never seen from any actor. Honestly everyone did a great job at playing their roles, those three were the highlights. It wasn't like Quantamania where the acting was carried by Jonathan Majors only and the rest were really annoying.Overall, a must watch for anyone. The Spider Verse movies are meant to be directed towards kids, but honestly adults will love.","5/10"
"christophercarmeloroman","28 January 2020","From the OG cell shaded work, to the insane combat, this movie Delivers everything that the last 30 years has been striving towards.
There are significant changes and alterations to the lore but they work in favor of fleshing out a fuller history. Yes I will always love Bardock Father of Goku as an origin story but this one gave me the honorable sacrifice that movie originated.
But that being said this movie is love and it's art
I love it","5/10"
"Chrysanthepop","3 March 2013","Finally 'got to watch Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' based on Yann Martel's classic novel. This is perhaps one of the few films that pays attention to detail in order to be as true to the book as possible. Of course filmmakers take cinematic liberty and there's nothing wrong with that as long as the final result matches up at least to what the book accomplishes (which isn't the case with most Hollywood adaptations). 'Life of Pi' is perhaps as accurate a film can be to its original. Now we come to Ang Lee and his art team's fantastic imaginative visualization. It's all about the details. While the CGI images look terrific, I also loved how the live images were captured, especially the colours of India. A majority of the film takes place at sea but even there colour plays a significant part. The detailed CGI designing of the animals especially the characters on the boat is impressive.Newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sincere performance. Irrfan Khan and Adil Hussian are great. Tabu is terrific in a small role. The child actors are very good too.For those who haven't read the book (read it if you haven't) and those who have, while 'Life of Pi' is a beautiful story of survival, in the end it's more about how imagination and how that alone can keep one alive when all else is lost.","7/10"
"chukkacabra","20 January 2024","Thanos has to be the greatest villain in the MCU one of television's most widely known. His infamosity isn't just his power (Dormammu and Hela are more powerful) but that other than Kilmonger, he's the only other MCU antagonist with understandable motives that audiences can truly believe in.I understand MCU movies aren't realistic documentaries, but there is no way Thanos should have been the winner in the movie. Thor and Hulk may not have beaten him, but they should have done more damage. On Thanos' home planet, even though he had multiple infinity stones, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star Lord, Drax, and Mantis should have taken Thanos down with their collective strengths.And the ending. Oh my. The most emotional, breathtaking cliffhanger in the history of television. So much so, that Endgame grossed over a billion dollars on opening weekend.","8/10"
"chukkacabra","31 January 2024","Jason Statham, one of my favorite action stars, is back at it again, sporting some of the most hair he's had in years. I'm glad that The Beekeeper is successful, since some of his recent films haven't been as good. It was everything I hoped it would be. Stellar fight choreography, brutal kills, and Josh Hutcherson as an extremely hateable villain. People need to learn to just appreciate strong action flicks, and The Beekeeper is one of the better pure action movies in recent memory, going up there with 'Extraction' and 'John Wick.' If you like action movies and Jason Statham, The Beekeeper is sure to become one of your favorites.","8/10"
"Cinema-reviewer321","22 April 2023","I liked Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and thought they were both fun Marvel movies. I thought Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) was ok, it could have been better because of some of the problems, but I was entertained when watching it.Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne are all good in the movie. Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang was good, I just wish they gave her better dialogue and things to do, and there were some characters that were not needed in the movie.Jonathan Majors as Kang The Conqueror was great, I thought he was interesting, intimidating, and powerful when you see what he can do and his backstory. There was another villain character that connects to the other Ant-Man movie, I thought he was cool for a bit until they did something to the character that I did not like that much.The look of the Quantum Realm looked cool and believable, and the action scenes were good along with having some weird editing at times. The movie is funny most of the time, and then there are some moments that were not funny, but this movie was entertaining.There are problems that involve how certain things play out, but I though Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) was entertaining, funny, and fun to watch. There are after credit scenes that lead to upcoming movies and an upcoming show that was cool, but I think if you like Ant-Man and Paul Rudd then you will like this movie like the earlier two.","3/10"
"Cinema-reviewer321","31 January 2024","What I expected from an action movie starring Jason Statham called The Beekeeper (2024) was that it was going to be a dumb fun action movie with entertaining action and a great performance from the lead actor, along with the director David Ayer giving the movie some kind of style to it; after watching the movie I got what I thought I was going to get, and had an entertaining time watching it. The action movie The Beekeeper (2024) is an entertaining, dumb, and fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously with the lead star being cool to watch, the action sequences being well done, and having simple but easy to hate antagonists; this movie does have issues like some of the dialogue and how the third act is played out, but if you think about any issues in the movie, then the whole thing will fall apart, which is why I say it's a dumb and fun action movie.Jason Stathan as Adam Clay was great to watch him go on a revenge quest to get back at a big company of scammers that did something wrong to a person that he knew that lead to her being killed, so it is satisfying to see him kill off these bad people because you know they have wronged him in such a way that should not happen again; I also liked the certain skills he has in fighting, knowing ways to get in a building, and how he handles situations. Seeing him do his beekeeping job was fine and I liked how he uses certain beekeeping methods against people he is fighting; other than him, there is the daughter of the person Adam Clay knew who died and she is some kind of FBI agent following the brutal trail of murders from Adam Clay leading to the higher ups of the scamming company, but her moments at crime scenes were a bit unnecessary and was not that interesting even though it could have been, since she is connected to someone we know.The antagonist is mainly Josh Hutcherson's character who is a spoiled rich jerk who takes the money from the scammers and puts it out to other companies he owns, or he just uses it for pointless stuff leading to him unknowingly angering Adam Clay; the other character who is more of a father figure to Josh Hutcherson's character is played by Jeremy Irons, who has something to do with what is happening in the company, but not completely where he is also the Beekeeper's target. The action sequences are fun, well-choreographed, barely has any cuts, and is cool seeing the actor Jason Statham perform them with cool stunts and brutal kills in entertaining ways; Adam Clay does make quite a few bee puns, which can be unintentionally funny becomes the movie does not take itself too seriously, but sometimes the lines of dialogue could get weird and just too cheesy on how they are said. I do like the information we get on the organization known as ""Beekeepers"" and how they are used to protect people or protect the ""Hive"" leading to them having fun with the idea, but the third act took itself seriously on how it played out and how people were acting; it should have just kept going down the path of not taking itself too seriously.The Beekeeper (2024) has its issues, but it is a dumb and fun action movie starring Jason Statham that I was entertained by, and while watching thought it was like the other action movie John Wick (2014); the performances are good, the action sequences are fun, and the antagonist is simple and easy to hate so you can be satisfied by what happens to him. If you like cheesy dumb action movies, I would recommend this movie to you, but if you do not like intentionally funny and dumb action movies, then you should not watch this; I expected this movie to be fun and entertaining, and that is what I got.","7/10"
"Cinema-reviewer321","7 July 2023","I love Raiders of the Lost Ark from 1981, I like the second movie Temple of Doom from 1984, but I like the first movie more, I love the movie The Last Crusade from 1989 as much as the first movie, but I like it more than the second movie, and I thought the fourth movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from 2008 was mediocre, with the first three movies being better. The fifth and last movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was good and a good ending to the character, with it being better than the fourth movie, and little better than the second movie, but I still think the first and third movie is better.Despite his age, Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones many years later; he is retiring from his job, and he is watching how the world changes around him since his younger years. Going on this last adventure to find something a friend of his was looking for, and to stop the villain from getting his hands on it, while also dealing with his goddaughter who wants it for her own reasons. I like how Indy is getting tired of doing what he is doing but also still has some love for adventure, he was also good in action scenes in the certain places they go to.Indy's goddaughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not bad, I would have liked more done with her character by showing how she became the way she is, or how she could have learned certain things that are useful on the adventure, along with her sidekick named Teddy who was like Short Round from Temple of Doom. I liked the main villain Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen; his plan involving the Dial was interesting with his plans with the Nazis, and that he has a backstory involving an interaction with Indiana Jones; he was not much of an archaeologist, he knew and used math more to use in his plan that involves time.The opening involves a de-aged Harrison Ford that does look good, but sometimes the voice can sound older than he looked but also it would fit. The opening was great, it looked like the original movies and felt like them with a great action sequence that also sets up the main villain; all the action scenes are fun, nicely shot, suspenseful, and fast paced. Director James Mangold did a wonderful job giving this movie the same look and feel as the original movies directed by Steven Spielberg. The locations or caves they go through look cool, and interesting on how they tie to major points in history.The third act will divide some people, but because of other weird things that happen in the earlier movies, it was not that hard to believe; leading to an ending that is sweet and a nice end for the character. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was a nice ending that had callbacks to the earlier movies, great action, a fantastic musical score from John Williams, and Harrison Ford giving his all in his last movie as this famous character. This movie is not flawless, but I had fun with it, and I think fans will too.","3/10"
"CinemaClown","13 June 2023","The 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the commencement of their Phase 5 slate and it couldn't have started on the worst possible note. Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is a lifeless & lacklustre entry that has the ambition but not the vision to bring its quantum universe to life with any cinematic flair and isn't just the weakest of the three Ant-Man films but is arguably the worst offering in the shared universe.Directed by Peyton Reed, the story finds Scott Lang & his family accidentally transported to the quantum realm where they discover a new threat. All the elements that made its predecessors fun, lighthearted & small-scale adventures is gone in this latest outing as it comes packed with terrible visuals, cringe writing, uninspiring action & bland storytelling. Even the world building & character designs have a juvenile quality to them.Strongly abiding by the Marvel formula and deficient in even the basic filmmaking aspects, the film never manages to create any sort of intrigue or interest despite the uncharted territory the plot takes place in. The dialogues are atrocious, its attempts at humour fall flat every time and the performances are mediocre at best. Much is said about Jonathan Majors' impressive input but his work stands out only coz the rest are much worse.Overall, Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania is the latest eyesore from the crumbling franchise that's been on a downhill journey for some time now and may have just hit its lowest point with their latest run-of-the-mill garbage. A disappointment on all fronts despite my low expectations and an embarrassing piece of blockbuster entertainment, Quantumania is an empty spectacle and an early contender for the worst film of the year. A new low for Marvel Studios.","6/10"
"CinemaClown","16 June 2023","Bigger, better & breathtaking in ways most sequels never manage to, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an ambitious & audacious follow-up that takes what was refreshing & original about its predecessor and builds upon it in ways that catapults its world to better heights and delivers the expected greatness without sacrificing any of the emotional beats that ground its story & characters.Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson in their feature directorial debuts, the film utilises different animations for the different dimensions our characters traverse through while keeping the narrative arresting & accessible from start to finish. And all the time it takes to setup its premise during the first half is the reason why it's able to provide an onslaught of awesomeness in the next half.Everything is an upgrade here, be it the story, characters, animation, visuals, music, wit, gags & underlying themes. And the energy, vibrance, passion, heart & sincerity poured into every frame is evident throughout. Characters, both new & reprising, are treated with care, handled with flair and embedded with personalities. And the twists & revelations surface in ways that only amplify its edge-of-the-seat thrills & our investment in it.The only nitpick for me would be its lack of a proper resolution as it ends on a cliffhanger and is one-half of a full story instead of featuring a self-contained narrative. Nevertheless, it's a minor complaint when taking into account the so many things that it gets right, for there are moments in this picture that had made me wondering if I'm watching the new greatest comic-book film of all time coz it's the perfect story of what it means to be a hero.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a bonafide masterpiece that outshines the first film in almost every aspect and is one of the greatest examples of its genre(s). A marvel of first-rate storytelling and a feat of groundbreaking animation that strikes a perfect balance between its visual & thematic elements, this latest offering in the Spider-Verse series is accomplished on all fronts and will leave its viewers absolutely dazzled yet hungry for more.","5/10"
"CinemaClown","18 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is an impressive entry in the rebooted Planet of the Apes series, and along with the previous two chapters makes up for one of contemporary cinema's finest trilogies. A strong, epic & emphatic end to a saga that began with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it is a moving, meditative & morally complex blockbuster that lives up to its enormous hype, and also cements its status, and that of its trilogy, as one of the most powerful sagas to ever unfold on the silver screen.","10/10"
"CinemaClown","3 July 2023","The fifth & final instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise and also the first to not be helmed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny brings the famous archaeologist back for one final outing yet finishes as a bland & bloated blockbuster that fails to replicate the magic & bravado of its predecessors despite having all the necessary ingredients at its disposal.Co-written & directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the film opens with a thrilling & action-packed prologue that brings the titular artefact into play but then it follows it up with a series of events that just unfold with a straightforward monotonousness. Despite being the final chapter, it doesn't have the urgency, even the exposition is lame, and the action set pieces lack flavour.What makes the ride dull is the same rinse-n-repeat approach that surface throughout the film in addition to it not having any genuine sense of danger or adventure or escalation. Humour is often poorly timed and the picture also fails to provide John Williams any moment to allow his music to soar. Harrison Ford manages to hold his own in spite of the frailty in his performance but the rest are forgettable.Overall, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny begins on a promising note but gets bogged down by issues of its own makings. Most of the problems plaguing this latest sequel can be found in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too but even that disparaged entry employed better use of shots, cuts & outrageous set pieces. This one fares somewhat better as a whole but it is still a lifeless, overlong & mediocre offering.","6/10"

"CinemaSerf","16 January 2024","""Clay"" (Jason Statham) has worked for an off-the-books US government programme designed to provide the ultimate security to the democratic process by providing unlimited training and resources to a group of people whose job it is is to objectively protect the system. These folks are called ""beekeepers"" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of ""Eloise"" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with ""Clay"" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.","9/10"
"CinemaSerf","4 June 2023","Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it's also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you'd expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey's seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it's moments - assuming you can catch it - and there's a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole ""multiverse"" theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I'm not sure I'll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for ""Miles"" and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.","4/10"

My expectations were lowered but still, I'm puzzled by the shallowness of of this effort. Phoebe Waller -Bridge's character is basically just obnoxious. Think Shia LaBeouf with boobs.One of the hallmarks of the Indy films has always been the humor. But
when the titular character is the butt of most of the jokes, you're not winning any admirers. Also the choice to play most of the action sequences in half light, may have helped disguise some of Ford's age but ultimately sells a remarkable actor short. We're aware of his age, we're here watching because we respect and love him and his craft.In the end, disheartening and unsatisfying.","6/10"

"cks116633","24 July 2017","To start, this is the first movie I've ever reviewed. After seeing this movie I felt the need to get my opinion out. So, what a long journey from the city of Misstreadedville with a final destination at Depressingland it was. You're telling me it's not enough that he is running for his life to save his people (depressing). His wife and one kid get killed (even more depressing). But wait, there's more, he and his people become slaves (thanks for reminding me about the worst tragedy in the history of the world). So here's our chance for an awesome battle with good apes and good humans. Epic action to see Caesar be his hardcore self, right? Nope. We see him battle no one and get shot by the person he spared. What an opportunity for mercy to be given back. So that's it right? Wrong again. We see super smart Caesar, not plug his wound and travel through the desert bleeding out. As a father he must have some small attachment to his soon to be orphan kid right. Wrong again.So finally we arrive at Depressingland. To say I demand an alternate/extended ending is an understatement. Please fix this.","8/10"
"Clank_Zoka","4 June 2023","I love Into the Spider-Verse, it's one of my favourite animated films of all time, it was so impressive and very entertaining , so of course expectations are high with Across the Spider-Verse, I saw it yesterday in IMAX and.. I think I love it as much as Into the Spider-Verse, it not better, it was definitely a full blown experience that was worth every second of it.It has everything that makes animation just special and unique, the big story, outstanding visual styles, gripping drama and amazing characters with funny comedy, I was engaged throughout the film and by the end, I did need to have a think about this unforgettable experience, since it left me with so much mixed emotions, laugher, tears, chills and even getting shocked in some places, it just shows how a sequel can be so much effective and big.So yeah, love it, absolutely love it!, exactly the kind of film we need, it respects animation and cinema at it's best, the best film of the year and nothing can beat it I'm sure, go see it when you can, it's worth the big screen experience.It deservedly gets 10/10.","9/10"
"clarkmick33","2 May 2019","There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down.
I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring.
Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers.
And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down.","10/10"
"Classic_Boxing_Matches","9 June 2023","The Lang/Pim family get sucked into the Quantum realm where they encounter a new, fearsome enemy - Kang the Conqueror.I have always been a huge Marvel fan. I can't say I was there since the beginning because I actually only started watching them religiously I'm cinemas since the first Avengers film - everything before that I watched retrospectively on DVD or Bluray. But anyway the first Antman film I quite enjoyed, it was humorous and action packed without being too over-the-top. The 2nd Antman film - Antman and The Wasp - was mostly pretty good but I didn't really like backstory of the villain that much. That brings us to Quantumania aka Antman 3. Since Spiderman Far From Home, I personally feel the Marvel films have become mostly lifeless and unintelligent. Sadly, although not the worst of the post Thanos storyline films, Antman 3 is nowhere near as good as it's predecessors. You could argue the stakes are higher sure and the scale of the story is huge which it is but there's also nothing new being done here... they've added in Scotts daughter Cassy as a new Antman (Antgirl?) and she's just a pointless as a character if you ask me and verh forgetable even though they try make her funny and integral to the story. The returning characters don't seem to have any depth to them and in some cases appear to have changed personalities to when we saw them last so I felt cheated. The overall story also retcons what we knew of the quantum realm.... and it's all explained away with a ""this is different."" Seriously that's it. Another bad aspect of this whole film though was the poor CGI and design. Some characters were dead basic looking and boring whilst backgrounds were bland and at times noticeably fake taking me out of the movie. Anyway, there was a couple things I did enjoy and one of those was MODOK. I usually don't like it when films change character backstories but this I didn't mind at all because it made sense and it was hilarious. The other thing I liked was Kang. I liked how he was portrayed, I liked his design and I liked how he was powerful yet still noticeably vulnerable. Kang by himself is not a Thanos level threat but as we saw during the mid credits scene, I think an army of Kangs probably is!Final Verdict: It really only serves the purpose of introducing Kang to the MCU and admittedly, it does that very well. Everything else about it is mostly forgettable except for MODOK who steals the scene. It's not as funny as previous Antman films and also not as smart, characters act differently and the CGI can be very hut and miss.","7/10"
"classicsoncall","10 February 2018","I'm still astounded by the incredible makeup that goes into creating the ape characters in these 'Planet of the Apes' movies. The facial features are so expressive that you would think they're the real deal. I think that's primarily what draws me to these pictures, as the stories become somewhat formulaic over time. What caught my attention in this one had almost nothing to do with the story per se, but the little things inserted by the film makers that brought back a hint of nostalgia for this viewer. Like the 'Bedtime for Bonzo' helmet on one of the human soldiers in the early part of the movie, and the Chevy II Nova chrome plate that showed up as one of the artifacts in the film. My first car was a 1969 Chevy Nova, so that's where the reference resonates with me. 'Ape-Pocalypse Now' was a bit of a stretch, but what the heck, that was kind of cool too.Interestingly, this was the second movie in a row I've seen in which Woody Harrelson kills himself. Out of sequence as I write this, but I saw ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" just the other day, and this one has Harrelson's character doing himself in too. It didn't seem like it had to go that way, so I guess The Colonel's condition was beyond hope, even though it didn't look that bad to me. The thing that bothered me in the picture was the lack of a back story to the young girl, given the name Nova (Amiah Miller) by the Orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval). One assumes she was the daughter of the soldier that was killed by the ape band, but it occurred to me that didn't necessarily have to be so. It would have been welcomed to have her character expanded a bit on.The way the story ended was kind of novel. The avalanche wiping out both The Colonel's men and the attacking soldiers from the North had the effect of wiping the slate clean so the apes could move on. Unfortunately though, just like the Bible character Moses, our hero Caesar never makes it with his troop to the Promised Land.","10/10"
"classicsoncall","21 May 2023","Well, it finally happened. Marvel has gone full-out Star Wars. Or Star Trek if that's your disposition, but with Disney owning the Star Wars franchise, that comparison is more apt. And not because the action takes place in Outer Space; it's more like Inner Space when you consider the Quantum Realm where the story takes place. The characters go sub-atomic almost right from the start and stay that way until the story concludes. On the basis of spectacular CGI and wonderful cinematography, the film would merit a '10' rating, but then you get to the story itself and that's where you have to average things down a bit. I don't think the story evolved from the two prior Ant-Man films. It's been too long since I've seen them and can't really remember them that well, but my reviews of both don't suggest a direct link to what happens in this one. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this flick, but not surprised that he did his standard Bill Murray type of schtick. He should try mixing things up every now and then. As for M. O. D. O. K., I thought that was Jason Alexander's head in the box. I felt he would have been a good choice for the role, but the guy was really Corey Stoll, who wasn't even credited! Why would that be? Anyway, I enjoyed this about as much as any other Marvel movie, but just like a lot of them, including the first two Ant-Man flicks I mentioned, it won't stay in memory very long after seeing it. Someday when I have the time maybe I'll watch these films back to back, but for right now, I'm pretty much satisfied with one and done.","7/10"
"classicsoncall","21 October 2023","When I first watched and reviewed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", it ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Movies of All Time. It now sits at #67 as I write this. At the time, I thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters. Regarding the story however, it wasn't particularly new or innovative. How many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? This one, if I can make a timely comparison, might have been titled ""Spider-Man: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"". That comes with the territory of taking place in a multiverse, where just about anyone and anything goes. It's just a little bit too much in my estimation, making the story somewhat confusing and disjointed, perhaps perfect for the attention deficit generation, but unappealing to someone my age who grew up on the very early Spider-Man stories. There's some nod to that era, with a brief glance of an 'Amazing Fantasy #15' comic book cover, along with various other covers appearing in too rapid succession to focus on their relevance. Another turn off for me was the clichéd dialog that took place throughout the story, with phrases like 'been there, done that', 'wait, what?', and the ever-popular turn of phrase, 'are you serious, right now'. It all made for a direct appeal to an under twenty-five-year-old audience, nothing wrong with that, but with limited appeal to someone who's outgrown their teen years. At present, the movie ranks #22 on IMDb's Top 250. I think it hit as high as #11 when I was following it when it came out. That's higher than its predecessor, and will probably remain that way as both progress down the chart over time. The fact that it was not a done in one film was also a mild annoyance, particularly since it didn't recommend to me that I had to catch the next installment, considering the disorderly course of this one.","10/10"
"classicsoncall","27 December 2023","I'm a little surprised at how the movie got panned by critics and seems to get the brush off here on IMDb. It actually rates a bit higher than 2008's 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', which doesn't put it dead last out of all five films of the franchise. Here's what I think - if one hadn't seen any of the other Indiana Jones flicks, I think this one would rate quite a bit better than it does now, a '6.6' at the time I write this. Yes, it's got a ludicrous time travel component to the story, but is that any crazier than getting chased by a huge boulder (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") or eating monkey brains (Temple of Doom')? I had a pretty good time with this one, starting right off with the escape from the Nazis and Dr. Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), and the quick transition to 1969 with the Beatles' 'Magical Mystery Tour'. The song's title heralded all that magical adventure to follow attempting to locate Archimedes' Antikythera, the legendary Dial of Destiny with the power to open fissures in time. At eighty-one years of age, Harrison Ford shows he's still got some gas in the engine when it comes to keeping up with the much younger cast. His character's reconciliation with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) at the finale was a nice way to bring the franchise to an end, and I think the filmmakers did a pretty good job of keeping the spirit of Indiana Jones alive through all of four decades. We even got to know Indy's real name, as I don't recall it ever being mentioned in any of the other stories. For those with the need to know, it was Henry Walton Jones, Jr.","7/10"
"classicsoncall","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","10/10"
"classicsoncall","6 October 2017","What amazes me about director Ang Lee is the totally disparate types of films that he puts together. One wonders how ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and this movie all come from the same creative mind. I just find it fascinating.Of those other films mentioned, this is one that comes closest to resembling a spiritual journey for the principal character. Told at first as an allegory, and later contrasted with the 'true' story of what happened when the young Pi (Suraj Sharma) survived a shipwreck ordeal, this appears to be Lee's take on a search for God and for the meaning of existence. I didn't find the adult Pi's (Irrfan Khan) challenge to the writer (Rafe Spall) about the proof of God's existence as being definitive, and I don't think that's what one's take on the picture ought to be.I think what the story should reaffirm in anyone watching it is that one has to meet life's challenges as they occur with a sole reliance on one's ability to think things through, form a plan, and execute it to the best of one's ability. What Pi had to endure on the open ocean was nothing short of an impossible situation, yet he made the most of it by using his own wits and the available resources he had. That he had to overcome the challenge of a vicious adversary in the tiger, forced Pi to consider his options, none of which included the easy way out of simply giving up.The CGI and special effects in the picture are extraordinary, as evidenced by awards won for Cinematography and Visual Effects at the 2013 Oscars. For his effort, Ang Lee also took home a Best Director. It's on the strength of this and other films by Lee that I seek out his work whenever a new picture comes out that he's directed. Whether you like them or not, he always delivers a compelling movie that makes you think when it's over, and that for me is always a good thing.","10/10"

"ClaytonDavis","28 September 2012","There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of ""Pi,"" a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with ""movie stars."" Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it.Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)","8/10"
"ClearAllSpam","28 April 2019","Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense.
The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring.
I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again","10/10"
"cliftonofun","10 July 2023","They managed to land the plane, literally and figuratively. While the last Indiana Jones movie left a bad taste in my mouth, this one offered a satisfying final chapter. Ridiculousness is baked into these types of adventure tales, but that ridiculousness should enhance rather than dampen the story. Dial of Destiny rides that line. The first half or so just flew by - great action storytelling that left me cackling with delight. The second half got a bit bogged down, but still managed to inch across the finish line. It is fitting that this last Indiana Jones story would be not only an epic quest, but a reflection on what it means to grow older and figure out our next/final chapters.","6/10"
"cliftonofun","5 May 2019","Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU.","10/10"
"clydekaila-04310","10 August 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" does an incredible, if not, amazing job of keeping the audience totally immersed in the story. With a perfect balance of telling and showing with its unmatched comic like animation, fresh and free flowing dialogue with undertones of humor and seriousness alike (achieving a perfect mix, adding to the story with cinematic aspects amplifying tone), outstanding street and abstract art and coloring along with beautiful cinematic lighting alike and masterful storytelling seamlessly completing the character arc of even the newer characters, hooking viewers deeper and deeper into the story unraveling every level (there's so many levels to this. Not to much. Just right. Oh soo good!) with every scene or sequence of scenes and act along with the totally insane and literally out-of-this-world action sequences and effortlessly engaging sound scape. A total must-see. A masterclass in storytelling and digital animation. Absolutely Brilliant in every way. Huge thanks to the Directors, Producers, Writers, Animators and Sound scape teams and Actors. Absolutely CANNOT wait for Beyond The Spider-Verse.","10/10"
"cmalpelli","2 July 2023","Personally I thought that the movie was pretty good, I'm curious why so many people were so harsh regarding the story, I thought it was just fine. The acting was great and the CGI was exceptional, combining for a overall good movie, the critics are hard to please these days which I find odd given how many garbage movies we have at our disposal in the past 20+ years. What exactly are people expecting, yes I've seen better movies but I've also seen movies that are much worse, I truly hope that this won't be a trend moving forward that each and every Marvel movie will be scrutinized to the fullest extent.","7/10"
"cnitinb","22 November 2012","Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'? But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!","9/10"
"coachsalm","10 July 2023","I have grown up with the Indiana Jones movies, so perhaps I'm biased, but I don't know what more Indiana fans could want in a movie. We get one last time to spend 150+ minutes with our favorite archeologist.The gift of Harrison Ford keeps giving and after 40+ years the 80 year old Harrison/Indiana gives a great and appropriate performance. I thought the de-aging scenes were great and incredibly natural looking.The action scenes were exciting and didn't drag on as they did in the interminable Flash and recent Guardians of the Galaxy. The CGI wasn't overwhelming and didn't detract from the movie as in those above mentioned movies and the latest Any Man film.The story was great and all the performances were in keeping with the exceptional jobs done by actors in the other movies in the series.If you're an Indy fan go see the movie and enjoy yourself!","6/10"
"coastdaze","13 January 2024","It's a shame that action movies don't have a category of their own. Statham never disappoints me. I think this is one of his best movies, but I generally like them all. I am a woman and I don't know any other woman who likes action movies like I do, unfortunately. The Beekeeper is a 2 hour romp into that genre of movie that makes me hope there are men like this in the world. Beekeeper flows well, the action is top notch and fun, maybe a little shocking at times. Well-written screenplay. Nice photography, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Sure, some may say Statham always plays the same type of character...why not, he's great at it. And his co-star, Raver-Lampman, wow. I like this gal and I don't remember seeing her in a movie before. I feel the same about Naderi. I'd sure like to see another great script in B2. I don't think the Beekeeper/Agent Parker justice storyline is done yet. Oh, and it was so good to see Rashad again, it's been too long. Jeremy Irons, too. Fun ride.","10/10"
"coasterdude44","7 May 2019","This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with ""Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home"" coming out later this yearOverall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get","10/10"
"coasterdude44","8 September 2019","I'll admit that this is the first time I have seen anything Dragon Ball Z related, but after seeing this I am d keen on seeing more from this franchise and consider watching the original show. The one thing that struck me out of this film than anything else was it's incredible animation, direction and pacing. This movie never drags and is able to keep the viewer's attention throughout. All the characters were entertaining and the fight sequences were all great and well constructed. Overall a stunning and incredibly entertaining DBZ movie that should please any long time fans of the Dragon Ball Z franchise and is a fresh new installment in it's series of film, which is probably their best one yet in terms of quality. I'm excited to see what they will do next","10/10"
"cocalvert","17 January 2019","For a series that doesn't place a heavy emphasis in detailed plots and developments, the story was explained well enough from both the antagonist's to the protagonist's. Best news about this movie is Broly not screaming Kakarot's name for his entire screen time.
CGI and other special effects were well executed and brought a ton of flavor to the film along with the fight scenes themselves. If you are wanting a movie that strictly highlights the awesome duo of Goku and Vegeta then this is the movie for you! Best Dragon Ball movie yet.
Like most anime action movies it does have it's obvious drawbacks, but temper your expectations and you will come away pleased.","6/10"

It was a wonderful Adventure. And in case anybody didn't notice, they will be a sixth or 7th and 8th and 9th Etc as long as it makes money. Why? CGI baby! It's so realistic now! They can make stories up for whatever age Indy happened to be at the time.If Harrison Ford chose to for the sake of his offspring and family, he can sign off on his image being used indefinitely for the characters as long as somebody is there to benefit from the gross sales.Long Live Indiana Jones movies starring Harrison Ford.

"colewaters","22 July 2017","War For The Planet of the Apes was a fantastic film especially in 3D. Once again Ceaser was the main Ape and I was super excited to see that. The film was kind of confusing at first, but it quickly became really enjoyable this was by far the best in the series. The 3D in this movie was stupendous every second of the 3D was amazing. Woody Harleson was great acting in this movie like always.Parents this movie is really violent with a lot of war violence and brutal action so if you don't want your little ones to see this kind of movie then just wait till they get older but show it to them in 3D. Like I said in my Dunkirk review this film was perfection and the director did a great job directing the film. Besides the slow and confusing part at the very beginning the rest of War For The Planet Of The Apes was fantasticThank You for reading and I hope this review helped enjoy the filmMy score 10/10","4/10"
"colewink97","5 June 2023","Spider-man was a a visually transcendent cinematic experienceThat movie just did some incredible things for animation & story telling.

"colinozz","31 January 2024","The Beekeeper is BETTER than John Wick. There I said it, ignore the negative comments, it is actually an intriguing storyline that drags you in. It was a big budget action flick that somehow reflects our society. Of course with this much action it stretches credibility but what action flick doesn't? I highly recommend watching this movie, not to critique it but to sit back with your popcorn and enjoy over an hour of pure fun. Jason Stathan love him or hate him is one hard man in his movies. Jeremy Irons played a role almost identical to his role in Margin Call another of my favourites which was actually better than the big short. Go and enjoy a great movie..","10/10"
"comicnerd-22808","9 January 2020","Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money.","10/10"
"Committed_to_nitrate","8 July 2023","Like an obligatory visit to an old relation, it's nice to catch up but after a while, you're looking for an excuse to leave.The original Indiana Jones films had a wonderful sense of nostalgia for the old movies and tv shows Spielberg and Lucas grew up with. Whereas those ones were inspired by classic boys own adventure stories by the likes of Rider Haggard, this seem inspired by The Expendables and other trashy action pictures.This is a reasonably enjoyable film but the endless succession of fights, car chases, fights, fights and more fights just get tedious after a few hours. Ford and PWB are both excellent creating real people you can believe in but the story lacks soul. The relationship between them feels genuine and actually quite touching but there's far too much padding. It feels like they were given $300M and told to just spend it on whatever they could.It's certainly worth watching but it's disappointing.","6/10"
"comolgab","12 January 2019","Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","10/10"
"condythug","17 January 2024","Good action movie with the reliable Jason who kicks ass throughout without moving a muscle in his expression. Fun mindless movie; suggest viewers to avoid overthinking the plot (there is none) so that u can enjoy the good action sequences.I would normally not watch Jason's movies but since there are hardly any good movies these few weeks, this is a good one to tide the time till the good ones come back.6/10 for good action and overall fun movie for those not overthinking the plot. The ending is really a bit underwhelming but on hindsight its my fault for expecting some twists since the movie is as expected. Pay your movie ticket price and get 2 hrs of action. That's it!","10/10"

"cookienocrazy","26 January 2019","I should start this by saying this was my introduction to the Dragon Ball franchise, and as some other reviewers have noted this might not be the best jumping in point. That said, fresh impartial eyes can be useful for giving an objective review, and I am familiar with anime, as well as other Japanese cinema and culture.
There was definitely something to enjoy here; the animation was solid, the soundtrack and audio in general was good. BUT this film suffers from major structural issues.
The first half of the film is fairly rushed backstory, rushing you through some pretty complex and convoluted history without allowing any space in which a character (any character) can be written with even the slightest depth. The second half is a fight scene between a few of those characters. Really, the whole second half of the movie is one drawn out battle. It's an impressive battle, with some pretty great direction and engaging moments. It's not unenjoyable, but it lacks the depth required to care about the outcome.
Ultimately, this film doesn't really have a story. It has convoluted BACKstory and a fight. That's all.
As I left the cinema I overheard some die-hard fans say 'it felt like half a movie'. I agree. There's stuff to enjoy in that half a movie, but that's what it is.","10/10"
"coolbirish","21 January 2019","No more hating Kakorot for crying too much next to him as a baby that drove him to insanity (yes that was a thing). Now we have a true origin story for the Ledgendary Super Sayjan. That, mixed with seeing an even darker Freeza, in my opinion is what makes this the best movie in the franchise to date. The graphic style has changed which they are known to experiment with from time to time but the fight scenes do take you on a wild ride.","10/10"

"coreyjdenford","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","1/10"

"cosmo_tiger","10 February 2013","""He said you had a story that would make me believe in God."" Pi (Sharma) is a young man living in India trying to find himself. After discovering Krishna he finds Jesus and has to convince his family he is serious about it. When his family falls on hard times they decide to sell their zoo and move to Canada. When an epic storm hits the boat they are traveling on everyone but Pi is lost. Now on a life boat with only a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker to keep him company he must figure out where he is and how to get to land. I have said before that 90% of the way you feel about a movie is the expectations you had for it going in. I expected this to be boring and I was not excited about it at all. Almost from the beginning it had me interested and by the end had totally won me over. This is nothing like I expected at all. The movie is very religious and extremely deep and very thought provoking. By the end you are questioning everything you saw and leaves you wondering what to believe. That is the sign of a good movie, one that leaves you thinking about it long after its over. While I don't think this is the best picture of the year I did like it much much more then I expected and will say its one of the best of the year. Not bad for a movie that I expected to fall asleep watching. Overall, surprisingly good and very much worth seeing, you will be surprised like I was, the trailer does not do the film justice.

"Couchkik20","30 January 2024","I like that the pitch is what if Halloween's Jason (or any immortal slasher killer) was the good guy. This movie makes REACHER look gentle, sophisticated and subtle. The silliness of this movie is enjoyable. We're talking 80s dumbness with a bit of Luc Besson's movie's shiny look and stupidity. This is a violent comedy vaguely inspired by John Wick but happy with being fun and crazy with some bad CGI explosions.Of course you have the diversity female part as the badass cop to side with our invincible white hero. Jason Statham is half Bruce Willis half video game meathead and the less he talks the more he's in character. Josh Hutcherson looks like Jack Harlow if he was in Duran Duran.

It's not even funny. At all. It's just there. Taking up two hours of your existence you'll never get back. Thankfully I didn't pay two cents to see this turkey in the theater. Worst villain of all time in any Marvel film. He is stale, bland, and a combination of ever villain in every rotten Sci-Fi film. Stop making these movies. You've jumped the shark. The MODOK character is laughable in all the wrong ways. From the dialogue to his appearance. Spend a few shekels to at least make the film visually appealing. You don't care if they ever get out.

"cpbottss","3 July 2013","Let me start this review by saying I have enjoyed many of Ang Lee's films in the past. Let me also say that I am an animal lover. And as an animal lover I am appalled that this movie got made. Now I am fully aware that a significant portion of the animal scenes were cg. Nonetheless, the extent of distress that the animals suffered in the actual scenes that were used on top of a blue screen amounted to nothing less than gross levels of animal cruelty and so typical of a person completely indifferent of modern day animal issues. For that Ang Lee should be ashamed of himself. Bottom line, I can't say strong enough that this is NOT a story that should have been put on film!!!I say that for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that the start of the film was culturally inaccurate. The mere suggestion that an Indian boy could freely and happily explore Hinduism, Islam and Christianity is nothing short of ludicrous and extends way beyond the scope of being able to 'suspend disbelief'. As for the cg, again, I felt is was ordinary at best and certainly not worth all the Oscar buzz it achieved. Don't get me wrong, I got the bigger message. I just don't think the vehicle for it was suitable for film and I don't think it can be even mentioned in the same sentence as films like Avatar. I have not read the book and I'm sure it was a great book, but it should have stayed a best selling novel. As for the film; it is used toilet paper and for his complicity in gross acts of animal cruelty, I hope Ang Lee never works again.","10/10"
"craigearl","22 June 2019","Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?)
2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA).
3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void.
4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration.
5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!","10/10"
"craigrobinsn","28 April 2019","The end of an era! The hard core fans will absolutely love endgame as it's really does round of the series with awesome cameos from various films. If you've been attached to the MCU through out and watched all the others, you'll love this. (Visiting Guardians 1 or Avengers Assemble) However if you're a casual fan you may not get as excited when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"". A line we've all been waiting for since the beginning, or appreciating Captain America welding the Mjolnir since the teaser from Age of Ultron.However it's not as fast paced as infinity war and more predictable than infinity war. We knew someone would die at Volmir for example and very likely Stark would be a sacrifice due to strange handing over the time stone. The film started off slow, however had an awesome finish!Overall film is 8/10 from me! I think the film was amazing, but perhaps needed to be little more faced paced like infinity war and less character development (we've had 22 movies) well worth watching!","6/10"
"Crazy_Cracker17","1 May 2018","All over movie is good. better than AOU. but the problem remains same. they keep cracking jokes which makes . I liked only one character doctor strange. he was only serious about everything. banner trying to make hulk out and hulk dont wanted to, that part in starting and in end were so stupid. no good music, no avengers theme, no any sequence 
there is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches.
even end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.Tony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it.
action scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war.
This is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there. No complicated plots. plot holes. no combination of music/sound. 
no interesting and emotional plot like civil war and doc. strange movie.I hope next part will be better than this.
it has its flaws and big disappointments, but still its watchable movie and forgettable movie too.","10/10"

"cricketbat","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.","7/10"
"cricketbat","16 February 2023","I would like to review Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but there's no time! Don't you see? We just don't have the time to talk about this movie! I'll review it when I can, I swear! That's basically what Ant-Man 3 feels like. A few simple conversations, a couple confessions, and most of the problems in this movie would have been resolved. However, I was happy to see that it isn't too tied into other MCU properties, and it does offer some resolution in the end. Paul Rudd is likeable, as usual, and the filmmakers are swinging for the fences with the visual effects, but the story just comes up short.","7/10"
"cricketbat","24 April 2019","Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga.","10/10"
"cricketbat","28 December 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes is a fitting conclusion to this surprisingly well-done rebooted franchise.

"cricketbat","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it's still completely unnecessary. I consider Dial of Destiny to be a second chance at an appendix to Indy's story. The plot of this movie never seems to get out of second gear. In fact, I was surprised when I realized the climax of the film had passed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is fine in her role, but she seems to be trying to steal the spotlight at times. And while the de-aging visual effect has improved, it just doesn't look quite right. For me, Indiana Jones is still a trilogy that concludes with the Last Crusade.","7/10"
"crimson-17255","30 July 2017","The only reason I went to check out this movie is because my brother wanted to and since I'd watched the previous movies I figured it'd be fine. I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep in the theatre. There was hardly any action, the point of the movie seemed to be learning that revenge is not the way to go (unless you want to get your whole ape race captured by the evil man in sunglasses), and...well, nothing else","10/10"
"Cristi-Taly","9 October 2017","This movie is very intelligent created... Is the reality presented in an artistic, very artistic way... The evolved people understand the messages hidden behind the appearances, but the others don't... Unfortunately the world is full of humans less evolved than the apes in this movie. And because this kind of creatures get the power over others, the world (our world!) is in this generalized crisis as it is today... GOOD PEOPLE, UNITED CAN CHANGE THE WORLD!!!...","1/10"
"CriticalThinking2","30 April 2019","After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws.","10/10"
"cruise01","13 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars.The Beekeeper is a pretty good action thriller film that puts Jason Statham back in a action role and at what he does best. This might as well be his version of a John Wick franchise.The plot is following a beekeeper (Jason Statham) after the lady he has been helping dies after being scammed and stolen from everything. He decides to go on the hunt for those that are responsible. Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen. Sure the dialogue can be a little repetitive with characters explaining a beekeeper and how they are meant to protect the hive which sure is explaining it to the audience of who this character is.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining action films from Jason Statham since the first Transporter films.","9/10"
"cruise01","14 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is an amazing film all around. It does conclude the story arc with Caesar; from the human experiments and extinction to dealing with Kopa's hatred towards humans and going against what he believes that not all humans are bad. It is a satisfying third film that ends on a high emotional note were there is enough development that you care more for the apes than the humans. Director Matt Reeves does not leave out the emotionality on the humans as well. He does build the emotional impact on how the virus has affected them and reshape the rest of the remaining survivors. Even, when the virus has evolved and started to affect the victims from speaking. I feel like Matt Reeves was inspired by a lot of films and biblical themes to help create this plot of Caesars movement on trying to find peace for his family and apes. He is minding his own business with the humans. He is just protecting his kind from harm. Until, Colonel (Woody Harrelson) wants to wipe out all the apes and trying to save civilization. When Caesars apes are captured and forced as slaves. Caesar will do whatever it takes to set his apes free and to find them a peaceful home. The plot was amazing; it does conclude the trilogy well. Also, opening up the movie for more with other stories to tell as characters grow over the time span and become something without giving away spoilers. The film introduces bad ape (Steve Zahn) who mentions that there are other apes out there in the world that evolved like Caesar did and talk like him. It does open up that there other evolved apes like him. And also, the film brings in another human character of a little mute girl (Amiah Miller), who is lost and alone which Caesar and Maurice bring in to their group.The action sequences are breathtaking and the climax battle with the military is exciting and epic. I love the new setting and concept with Caesar and Maurice going after the colonel for his attacks towards their camp. It is an epic journey and Caesars journey as he is becoming a figure of a leader that sets his apes free and knows what is right and wrong. Caesars path towards revenge against the colonel does make him question if his hatred is making him become like Koba. The visual effects are impressive. Every detail and sequence is great. Michael Giacchino music score is beautiful and amazing. Probably one of his best works yet. Woody Harrelson as the villain, it does make him feel like a cliché villain when he walks to an outdoor camp with sunglasses at night but that is not a major issue with the film. There are a lot of great emotional moments with the film as the little girl is trying to help Caesar when he is starved and captured to some breathtaking action sequences. Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes is a great amazing film. It ties the trilogy up well in a high emotional note. The visual effects and the performances are great. The action sequences are exciting. The plot is epic with Caesar and his journey to saving his apes. I definitely recommend to see the film if you seen the others or not.","3/10"
"cruise01","5 September 2023","5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is an awesome animated superhero film that tops the previous film as it continues the Miles Morales storyline and this time taking its setting in other multiverse which him and several other spider mans are trying to stop a villain called the Spot. The action sequences are incredible. Its very stylistic while the animation is an energetic filled that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Editors and directors were amped up on energy drinks working on this project. The soundtrack and music score is awesome. The story is great. It dives into an emotional connection with Miles responsibility as Spider Man vs. Telling his mom and dad about his secret. While trying to save everyone. The film ends in a bang and a cliffhanger which you ll be anxious for a sequel.Overall, it is one fun wild ride that is a superhero film that is energetic and stylish that wont disappoint to superhero or action fans.","10/10"
"crwnroyale","25 June 2023","This is a movie is a must watch after you see the first one. You will not be disappointed. Nicely made family movie. I also truly enjoyed that I didn't notice any subliminal targeting of sexuality. Miles is still trying to grown into himself and figure out who he is. He is a smart young man but struggles with balancing life as hero, student, and a son. This movie has some classic throwback moments that links it to other spider-man movies.You will be drawn into the movie quick and begging for more. It was very funny noticing that Miles isn't the only spider-man that tries to disguise their true voice when talking to family.","10/10"
"css_i","12 January 2019","This Movie has shown what a DragonBall film could be at the TOP of their game. Superb Animation with an emotional storytelling that finds its heart despite the massive action sequences. You will feel for the Saiyan Race for the first time. You WILL care about the Broly character and what he has endure since his exile.Akira Toriyama manage to give the proper place not just to the origin of the franchise but to Broly himself, not as an evil killing machine but more of a result of the terrible circumstances of his childhood.The soundtrack of this film is superb as well, hitting all the good notes where they need to, in the drama and the action scenes the music just felt right.This is a great film for Fans and definitely Newcomers who have no idea where the Saiyans come from or what fuzz is about.As a big fan who owns a big part of their classic films i can say without a shadow of a doubt, this is their BEST WORK!","10/10"
"cstull91","8 June 2023","The film made me so upset because there was no epilepsy or flashing lights warning, horrid sound mixing, and overall so flashy it just wasn't fun. I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.It honestly felt expensive, but overall just lazy.Really disappointed.","7/10"
"CubsandCulture","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","5/10"
"cultfilmfan","25 November 2012","I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book, but have read Beatrice and Virgil, which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi, was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know, I am not a fan of 3D, or basically even in seeing films in 3D, but to me, Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology, or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening, or perhaps ugly, but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot, so I do not spoil it for other viewers, but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character, Pi, he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times, that he does not quit, or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself, but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times, he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging, or difficult times, but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives, but on the same thought, I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs, alcohol, or sex, but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming, but through all of those trials, I have been able to rely on God, and while often in those situations I felt anxious, or like giving up myself, I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough, or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No, going through it was not always easy, or fun, but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction, or some type of sin that while it may not seem so, is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy, or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier, healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin, addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him, give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days, weeks, or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand, but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes, ears, senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about, but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement, but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it, but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover, or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films.","6/10"
"curmudgeon86","2 October 2023","Into the Spider-Verse was one of the rare big studio movies that felt fresh, authentic and full of heart. Across the Spider-Verse falls short of matching its predecessor in each of those counts.Whenever a superhero movie succeeds, big studios try to distill its essence down to a formula, trim out any creative risks to make it safe for large-scale public consumption and add some fanservice. This is the case with the second instalment of Spider-verse.Except for the art. The art was brilliant and original. But little else stays with you after after the end.On a side note, is anyone else tired of multiverses? In the first movie, spider-beings from different dimensions were fresh and funny. Twenty popular movies and series later, it feels played out. The central plot feels like something out of an old Rick and Morty episode.But the bigger problem was this: the essence of Spider Man stories is that he is both a teenager and a superhero. He has typical teenager problems, struggles to juggle his double life, makes mistakes and learns from them. The first half of the movie followed that template and was good fun to watch.But then the movie turns it upside down and the teens become smarter than the adults. The adult Spider folks in Spider HQ(which was basically Citadel of Ricks from R&M) not only approach a sensitive conversation with Miles with the delicacy of a sledgehammer, it's unclear if they even know what they are talking about.The centrepiece of the movie is an extended chase scene with little suspense about the result. Here's another thing that annoys me: making your hero suddenly overpowered by having them beat other characters in a way that defies in-universe logic.The English punk spiderman made me chuckle though.","8/10"
"CutlasSaber","4 July 2023","Maybe the headline for this review is dramatic, but even without my high expectations for this film it still ended up being a little disappointing to me.By no means is this movie bad, but compared to its privious installments it's a huge step down in my opinion.But what did I like about this film? Ignoring the plot holes, the story was pretty decent. Action was fine, and Harrison Ford did a good job with his stunts (yes, Harrison Ford did his own stunts). Admittedly the stunts weren't as great compared to the other Indiana Jones' movies, but with his age can you blame him? He did the best and I think the results were fine.The characters were fine too I guess. Wombat was probably my least favorite character, but I assume she's supposed to be unlikable with how her whole character is selfish, which is something Indy acknowledges.If you didn't care for the supernatural aspects in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you probably won't care for this film then. It's really hard to explain without going into spoilers, but the Dial itself does have some sort of supernatural powers that end up being the whole climax of this film. But at the end of the day it matter to me, and it shouldn't matter to you anyways when a movie like Temple of Doom introduced voodoo.I'd say my biggest complaint was how this film played it too safe, but other than that I'm not mad at its existence because it doesn't really change anything for existing. The film's fine, its re-watchable for the action, but maybe not so much it's story. It's entertaining when it has to be, an underwhelming yet decent conclusion, and that's pretty much it.","7/10"

"cwt-73297","29 April 2019","The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next.","7/10"
"cyguration","8 April 2021","...of an Academy Award.A lot of people felt Serkis should have won for his portrayal of Gollum, but he puts that performance to shame with his turn as the not-so-poker faced leader of the apes, Caesar.It's the understated emotion that really bubbles to the surface in Serkis' depiction of the reluctant but always resolute Caesar.It's not easy to give a performance through a CGI ape and convey to the audience through vocal intonations and an extremely limited speaking script the hurt, the ambition, the hate, and the pain that Caesar feels, yet paired with an incredibly talented special effects team, Serkis manages to pull it off.I suppose I can't give all the credit to them, because the script for this film is way above par. It works on so many different levels, and it's really quite something because I just got done watching Godzilla vs Kong, and oh boy is there such a stark difference in screenplay quality between the two films.All while watching War For The Planet of the Apes I was thinking to myself ""Why couldn't the Transformers get this sort of on-screen characterization and treatment?"" The Hollywood excuse is always ""No one wants to see robots fighting for two hours!"" and yet that's always the best and only parts worth watching when it comes to the Transformer films.Here, however, director Matt Reeves flipped the script (I suppose you could say literally) by putting the focus on the CGI apes instead of the humans. The entire story is about Caesar -- everyone else plays second fiddle to Caesar.It basically proves that you can make a quality, character-driven film without tacking on some ridiculous human sub-plots just to pad out the time or tie together action scenes.In this particular case War For The Planet Of The Apes is probably misnomer given that this is not an action film. Yes, there are action scenes, but this is all character drama, with a few action set pieces to payoff the trilogy.I thought the original Dawn of the Planet Of The Apes was an okay film, nothing too memorable. I didn't care all that much for Rise of the Planet of the Apes. However, I have to say that I adore War For The Planet Of The Apes.The difference boils down to bringing the emotion out of the leads (who are all CGI apes), giving the main antagonist a complex and multi-dimensional approach to his self-proclaimed ""purpose"" and a few twists you likely won't see coming.I can understand why a lot of people may not like the film because it's methodically filmed and paced. This isn't The Fast & The Furious, and if you go in expecting more ""War"" rather than ""Planet of the Apes"" then I suppose you'll be sorely disappointed.However, if you're looking for a movie that's actually really well directed, better written than it has any reason to be, and a lot more emotionally driven than most other Oscar-bait dramas, then you'll definitely enjoy War For The Planet Of The Apes.And it still irks me that Serkis wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance. I didn't bother checking to see who won best actor for 2017, but I'm finding it hard to believe anyone turned in a more layered, heartfelt, and multi-dimensional performance than Serkis did with Caesar.","8/10"
"d_z-a","31 January 2019","Amazing movie, It truly did justice to the series and is the pinnacle of animation of this series. The battles were amazing and the art style was just absolutely beautiful and made the movie a true treat to watch!
However i did have some quirks with it.
Number one, They ditched the music for the fight scenes in favor of some ridiculous chanting. I was very annoyed at this but didnt take away a star since everything else was so well polished and i dont believe it deserves to be punished for this ( although it really should)
Second they made Brolly just a bit too strong from the start. He should have had to work a little harder to attain the power he got to , and the movie in turn felt a little rushed.
So in all honesty the movie actually deserves a 8.5/10 but it was such a treat in every other aspect that i feel obligated to give it a perfect 10/10!","9/10"
"D-Defoe","13 July 2017","What I do not like about this movie is the basic message: Humans in comparison to animals cannot be trusted, they show no mercy, the animals reach the higher ethical ground and should survive and reign the world.How is the goal of this message achieved? First, the whole movie plot is filmed from the perspective of the ape- society, their families, their friends, their love and their sorrows. Unlike the perfectly arranged classical Charleton Heston movies in the 60s which bore a shock element in a dark post-nuclear, post-apocalyptic world, where mankind destroyed itself, this movie aims at showing the worthlessness of human beings. The little blonde girl whose father got shot dead by Cesar, didn't loose a single teardrop for her father, but after a short while befriends herself with the apes, starts crying for a dead gorilla, who gave her a flower, gives water and food to the imprisoned killer of her father, Cesar, and feels herself quite comfortable now growing up as a monkey daughter in the sense of a Tarzan, yet in a considerable lower social position. Second, other humans, except maybe for Woody Harrelson as a pittiful leader of a small company, do not have character depth in this movie, and are basically the enemies, and except for the little blonde girl, they all die, either killed by monkeys, by themselves, or by a snow avalanche.What a stupid movie! What a stupid message! Worthliness of human beings is being shown here. Of course the human is bad from nature (described as sinner), as the Bible tells us, but he is not worthless, and as Gods creation is above the animals. Here you see the perversion of this idea to the extent.Now to the ambiance: Cold, snowy, Alaska-like landscape, no cities, no larger Human or animal dwelling places. Most of the time 5 apes and the little blonde girl take the central part in the non-inhabited boreal wilderness on seek of revenge.The fights: starting with a tactical nonsense Human uphill assault with well equipped tactical weapons against spears and still being lost. Only 3 humans and a silver-backed Gorilla get captivated, and after a short interrogation get released by Cesar, but later become his fiercest enemies again. Major explosions quite in the end of this almost two hours movie. I spare to pinpoint the many flaws of the fights there, just dumb.Better title in this case would be: ""War for the little ape reserve in the Northern Alaska (or whatever landscape it represented)""Cesar's portrayal - in the beginning: the good leader - in the middle: the bad revenge seeker - at last: and the ugly Spartacus in the workingcamp Conclusion of the movie: all humans dead (except girlie who feels herself as a monkey) and the long exodus to sunny monkey land next to a big evening-sun-bathed lake, where they all lived happily there after,...oh no, not all, Cesar finally died from his arrow wound, which he survived for the 1000 km trek through the deserts of death Valley (or whatever location it represented), with a last glimpse of his little monkey-boy playing with the little blonde human girl, he died right in the arms of his Orang-Utan friend Murksy, Mopsy...forgot the name.

"D4V1D2411","4 August 2022","When I watched this movie when I was a kid I was amazed. The story of survival was really impactful watching it the first time, the way Pi and Richard Parker interact with each other, one being and animal and the other being a human is really interesting, unique and sweet in a way. You feel a lot for both of them and their relationship that ends sadly. I dont know if its just me not being objective because as a child I loved this movie, but this journey is still one of favourites.","2/10"
"dabsbordeaux-52304","1 February 2024","Typical Jason film but decent if wasn't for the ""heroine"".What does she bring to the film at all ? She is a distraction and a disappointment every time she appears on screen.The film would have been much better off without her. She is not credible at all and seems uncomfortable in that role, even clumsy.She is obviously not built for this , and when I have watched her "" the umbrella academy "" ( I think ) it was more her style as not much was required of her...
I have enjoyed watching Jason which I hadn't seen much of lately , but she has ruined my film experience. She tries to play a solid character who finds everything, sees everything, understands everything, knows everything , but in fact ruins everything...
The rest of the cast were very good and although you can predict everything that will be happening next , the action scenes were good and almost credible ...;-)7/10 for Jason's performance.","10/10"

The storyline is overall amazing and the characters is so amazing. Everything about this movie is incredible. This movie has it all , those cute comforting scenes, action scenes and fights, those scenes when you just can't stop crying it has it all. Endgame is such an experience. This movie is and I think will always be the turning point of marvel.","10/10"
"daendil","6 May 2018","Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","2/10"
"dagallop","8 June 2019","What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again.","10/10"
"daisukereds","1 February 2024","Jason Statham remains a quality lead, and an action actor to be respected.. even if the vehicles he is in sometimes stink.Thankfully, the Beekeeper is cheese enough to be enjoyable! With great build-up, increasing stakes, ""good"" bad people (not liking Hutcherson helped a lot, great casting) and dumb enough developments to be fun. But there's an underlying sense of competence that allows you to be entertained, and not laugh at the movie's expense.. maybe the dialogue could have been improved, but the general idea and execution is solid. The Equalizer comparison is quite apt!Easy recommendation for fans of the actor and action scenes with a purpose.If allowed, I'd give this half a point more than I did.","7/10"
"dakwamyth-61293","12 February 2024","I like the attack on these scramming companies, and this movie dose just that. The law has failed to control these companies. And politicians use them. I think the only weak point here, is that the President claimed in Privet she did not know. In fact a Politician likely would have known, and worked to protect them.But anyhow, the story was very well done, and enjoyable to watch. Excellent cast and crew, that put this together very well. Statham did a wonderful job with his character, as well as the others. The woman that played the Daughter and FBI agent, did very good on her complex view on things. You kind of expected the ending, because it was the way most movies are done. But she kept you wondering which way she would go, with as few signs as possible.","10/10"

The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe.

"damh_frikinlater","21 November 2012","The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.But if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.If you think that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make ""Tron: Legacy"" looks so cool and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year.","10/10"

"danchilton-71955","23 February 2023","The problem with Marvel trying to widen the scope after the universe effecting events of Thanos and his technicolour dream glove is that the more you explore ""different"" realms the more obvious it becomes that everything is basically the same. The multiverse of ""madness"" turned out to be the universe of ""quite similar but the traffic lights are upside down"" and here the unknowable quantum realm, where physics and time don't exist in any way we understand, is just another alien world.To be fair, the alien world is a pretty cool one. There are funky creatures and weird characters, giving things a 50's B movie or Flash Gordon vibe, complete with appropriate wacky visuals. Sadly all this stuff is rushed, not really giving the chance to take in the view or enjoy fun moments, including a cameo everyone would surely love to have seen more of. You get the feeling an earlier phase of the MCU would have leaned into the ""Lost in Space"" of it all a bit more but here we have to move quickly on to the Super High Stakes. These involve Jonathon Major's Kang, played in a reserved style that makes him menacing but a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. Given he is from another dimension that may be the point. Kang's sidekick MODOK is a fun take on a ridiculous villian but the departure may divide comic book fans.On the hero front its good to see Michelle Pfeiffer given a substantial role and it looks as if a grown up Cassie Lang is intented to be a fixture going forward but Evangeline Lilly has such a reduced role it seems pointless keeping ""The Wasp"" as part of the title. Micheal Douglas is enjoyable when on screen but kept mostly to the periphery of proceedings and while he is having fun you can tell he isn't exactly massively invested in whats going on. Leading man Paul Rudd is, well, Paul Rudd. He brings the charm and liability to Scott Lang you've come to expect. He manages this despite being stuck with a pretty stupid character arc where he begins the film suddenly averse to helping people for no well defined reason.This is symptomatic of some fairly lazy writting in parts, with some of the most by the numbers dialogue yet seen in a Marvel movie. Fortunately there is enough visual and stylistic creativity on display to make the film more than watchable, if certainly no Giant Man of the genre.7 hyper intelligent insects out of 10 ants.","1/10"
"dandare4479","28 June 2023","Out of all the films releasing this year this was perhaps my most anticipated, nostalgia hey. But also my most feared from a legacy destroying perspective, especially after Crystal Skull. However Dial of Destiny is definitely grounded in classic Indiana Jones spirit. Adventure, action, and humour are all there in abundance. If you're willing to overlook some ropey cgi and the odd humour that doesn't hit its target. There's alot to enjoy and admire. James Mangold deserves credit in the way he has handled such an iconic character.Ford is fantastic as always, as is Mads Mikkelson.

The top-tier story telling continues, old characters return and new characters are introduced. Very well-crafted plot twists. YES, with a plural. I dont know if this story is completely original or they are following comic material, but its brilliant and ties in to the first movie. Frankly it feels more like one long story broken down into three parts, and we're smack right in the centre. The finale chapter is gonna be brilliant.Animation is returning to the spotlight.

Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that?

"danielharden","30 July 2017","The Planet of the Apes franchise is no stranger to remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels and literally every kind of incarnation or adaptation a film franchise can have. Back in the late 60's, early 70's we got the original film, plus several sequels, then in 2001 we got whatever the hell Tim Burton made, and then in 2011, Rise of the Planet of the Apes started, what is by far the best prequel series ever, and has thus far been, one of cinema's greatest all time film trilogies. 2017 marks the end of this prequel series with the release of War for the Planet of the Apes, The third and final film in this phenomenal series and yet again Matt Reeves strikes gold.What is by far the films greatest strength, is its depiction of war. The film creates a very realistic representation of what a war is like. There are multiple different battles going on, between opposing sides and within the same sides. Apes clash with apes and humans clash with humans, the film doesn't depict a black and white version of a war, it knows war is more complex than that and respectably portrays this. The film also adds quite a lot of depth, depicting characters inner conflicts rather than just the physical ones seen in battle. This really added to Caesar's already established character and gives him even more of a character arc than he has already had. Not only does Caesar get added depth, but Woody Harrelson's Colonel is given a very intriguing and personal backstory. This really added to the films realistic presentation of a war, showing both sides as having their own inner struggles and presenting both as in some way human. This film packs an emotional punch which is surprising from a blockbuster franchise film, even if the last two films have been glorious.Matt Reeves excellently directs this film, depicting war realistically and respectably, while also making a nonstop, action packed movie that deals a great deal of emotional impact. War for the Planet of the Apes is extremely engaging and is an utter joy to watch, thanks to an action packed script and masterful directing, well done Matt Reeves. As well as Matt Reeves, Andy Serkis strikes gold once again as Caesar. The man is truly a pioneer of motion capture and a living acting legend because of it. The man plays Caesar again, but differently to how we have previously seen him. Serkis shines once again, nailing the deeper inner conflict of becoming Koba, consumed by hate, unable to forgive, as well as slipping back into the role of Caesar like a pair of comfortable shoes.To criticise this film is hard, the criticisms for this film fall into the nitpick domain of film criticism, but nonetheless I shall state them. The film is awfully predictable, but in all honesty, what do you expect from a blockbuster movie and franchise sequel? Most films can be predictable if you think hard enough. Also the human soldiers/security in this film are hilarious. In the latter part of the film, the human henchmen are used so conveniently to progress the plot, being so hilariously bad at their job. This does take away from the realism the film creates with its depiction of war, and occurs so frequently that it's comical. I constantly found myself thinking ""How have none of the humans seen this?"" and ""Are you seriously going to do that? You are a trained soldier!""To conclude, War for the Planet of the Apes is the ideal end for this fantastic film trilogy. Andy Serkis and Matt Reeves are phenomenal once again, one upping on their previous efforts. The film does have some dumb moments near the end to further the plot and is a bit predictable, but the realistic depiction of war and the brilliantly crafted, action packed movie, with an emotional motive, outshines all the criticisms or nitpicks with the film. Apes together strong!","9/10"

From the very first scene to the final credits, this movie delivered a breathtaking visual experience that was simply unmatched. The attention to detail, vibrant colors, and innovative animation techniques made every frame a work of art.What truly set Spiderverse apart was its unique storyline and compelling characters. The film brilliantly introduced us to a multiverse of Spider-Men and Spider-Women, each with their own distinct personality and backstory. It was a joy to witness the diverse cast of characters coming together, forming an unlikely team of heroes who were relatable and deeply human.","10/10"
"danjstanley","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:
""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","7/10"

All my minor gripes about Into the Spider-Verse are absent and in its place captures the panel-to-panel thrill of reading your first ever Spider-Man comic. Smart, imaginary and completely unrestrained, Across the Spider-Verse might just be the very best Spidey movie ever made in what is an extravagant, very cool love letter to graphic design, executed with superb draftsmanship and giddy, infectious joy.It does lose half a star for the lack of The Emissary from Hell himself (also no 90s Christopher Daniel Barnes Spidey, but that's a personal peeve), although I bet good money he'll be in the next one.","9/10"
"daphnebiatchie","28 January 2019","Alright, I'm from the generation that watched dbz on cartoon network when i was just a kid. I watched the Broly movie years later then, and I loved them (well, the first one anyways, the second one was okay'ish)From that point of view, I have to say... it's not the same broly,
he looks the same, at some point, and yes, the story behind him is a bit better,
but all that made Broly Legendary, isn't there.What made ""old Broly"" great, was that he was a brute, unstoppable, vicious and just mocked his opponents efforts with a grin and a devastating counter attack.That Broly isnt there in this movie, and if I'm honest, the first part of the movie, the flashback, that part was great, excellent even, but the fight and ""whole idea about broly"" , it just feels like a way too long friendly practice fight.
it doesnt seem like anyone is ever getting desperate, Brolly is powering up to stand a chance against ""the good guys', instead of the other way around.The animation is top of the shelf though, music is good, voice acting..reasonable good, nothing particulary good or bad, just DBZ.I liked it, but hoped for better, and well... there wasnt anything at stake, so there never was any tension building up.
I hoped to see Broly, but it felt more like..Goku vs ""super annoyed Goku""Go watch it if you're a hardcore fan, or just curious, otherwise...dont trust ratings that give max stars for this imho","9/10"
"daralad","18 June 2023","I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.","10/10"

I've completely lost hope in MCU but will keep watching because of my stupid completionist side. That aside though...""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" was one of the worst disappointments of 2023 and ruined my day. Here I was after a long day from sitting infront of a computer working from 7 am to 3 pm (I'm a Data Technician with speciality in programming) and thought I would go home and enjoy myself with this movie without watching neither reviews or spoilers and turned out to be my biggest mistake. This was God-awful. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Didn't make me laugh like the first Antman movie did, hell even the 2nd one. The pitiful attempt at humour bordered on cringe almost. It was so uncomfortable.

"darkreignn","14 January 2024","I am not a fan of David Ayer, but I am a fan of Jason Statham, and so - also being inspired by the positive reviews - I decided to drag my dad to the theatre with me to watch this movie. And on one hand, I enjoyed it as a Statham action vehicle; on the other hand, this film is chock-full of virtually every single David Ayer cliche that you can imagine.Is there near-constant cussing in this movie because of script writing that would make middle school students blush? Yes, there is. Are there a large number of ridiculous looking and absurdly dressed characters that you cannot envision being in anything other than an Ayer picture? Oh, you better believe it. And is there over-the-top violence that has absolutely no business being portrayed as anything that would remotely even take place in the realm of reality? Of course! It's all standard Ayer fare, and while I am not too much of a proponent of that, I found ""The Beekeeper"" to be as entertaining as it was thanks, in part, to those creative decisions.As much as I would've appreciated a more straightforward, grounded take on the action genre, I'd be lying if I said that the ludicrousness of it all wasn't entertaining, because it was. From the constant bee puns and the hilariously energetic villains that would give Jordan Belfort a run for his money to Statham's stoic and almost inhuman performance and all of the horror villain-esque violence that he delivers upon his enemies, ""The Beekeeper"" is straight-laced farce. This is a movie that's dumb, and knows that it's dumb, but plays itself as serious as humanly possible. Because of that, you'll find yourself laughing with the movie while also finding a great deal to enjoy from the action sequences.""The Beekeeper"" features Statham at his most brutal, perhaps ever, employing a range of tactics that dispatch the film's villains in increasingly violent manners. Statham is a force to be reckoned with here, more akin to The Punisher than John Wick, and it really works. It's all very silly, but the brutality is fitting, especially since the villains are so despicable. You really want to see the villains get what's coming to them, and you get that through a series of action sequences that are each more elaborate than the next. I cannot emphasize enough how stupid the movie is, but I also can't emphasize enough how fun it is to watch on the silver screen.I am still not a fan of David Ayer after watching this movie, but I am impressed about how entertaining ""The Beekeeper"" managed to be. As I said, I would've preferred a more gritty, serious action movie than this was, but for what it was, this was fun, and I will definitely be adding this to my physical media collection.","2/10"

""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" is packed with high-octane and colorful action, warmhearted humor, and even some emotion and heart. Don't believe me? Read on!""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" hooked me almost right off the bat. The animation was crisp, colorful, and clear, and the story was surprisingly gripping. In the first ten to fifteen minutes you're introduced to plot points including themes such as paranoia, planetary domination, and betrayal. And as if that wasn't enough to grip me, at a certain point I even found my eyes starting to swell up; my cousin looked over to me, asking, ""Are you going to cry?"" And I wiped my eyes and said, ""I might.""So, ""Broly"" has high-quality animation, and a surprisingly well thought out plot - what else does it have going for it? For one, the soundtrack is, simply, epic. The music is big and brash and loud, and enhances the intensity of the action, as well as adds to the emotional beats.Also, the movie has a really good sense of humor throughout that never seems overly ridiculous or cartoony; there are multiple subtle lines of dialogue or sly actions that the characters make that add a real personality to this movie, never contrasting negatively against the semi-dark plot. Sure, there is comedy, but it doesn't feel shoehorned for mass audience appeal - everything feels surprisingly natural.""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" is a genuinely good film. There's enough cinematic meat for you to chew on with its soundtrack and beautiful, fluid animation, and especially with its story - the movie takes its time setting up the main plot, introducing characters and storylines that you'll want to see through to completion, even if you're not a huge fan of DBZ.","10/10"
"darkreignn","26 February 2023","Surprise! I really enjoyed this movie, which was surprising as it seems to be getting lambasted by critics and audiences alike. And on one hand, I can understand; people are getting superhero fatigue, and Ant-Man never was the most popular character out there. On the other hand, this third entry in the ""Ant-Man"" series of films is a science-fiction adventure that I, for one, couldn't get enough of.If you're a fan of straight up sci-fi, I honestly can't imagine how you wouldn't enjoy this movie; virtually from beginning to end, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an exercise in engaging world building and incredible visuals - on a purely visual aspect this movie is a 10 out of 10; the movie takes viewers through a world - a universe - that is so interesting to look at that I found myself almost jaw-dropped for 90% of this film's runtime. But of course, great visuals can only take a movie so far.Luckily, ""Quantumania"" delivers on pretty much every other aspect as well. With fantastic chemistry between its main characters, the film is a sheer delight to watch in terms of characterization and character interaction. Paul Rudd is charismatic as usual, but I was even more impressed with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kathryn Newton; you'd think the ridiculous subject matter would lead to ridiculous performances, but they're all bringing their A-game here, which was unexpected but appreciated. Now I know what you're thinking: ""How was Jonathan Majors?"" Let's talk about it.Introducing a new villain, Kang the Conqueror, ""Quantumania"" is apparently setting up the next biggest Marvel baddie. And while I found Kang to have a lot of potential, I wasn't particularly impressed with his villainy here, as much as I enjoyed Majors in the role. While Majors adds a cold menace to the character, I found a lot of Kang's dialogue to be trite and evil for the sake of being evil. While his initial introduction is more nuanced, the film foregoes that, and instead makes the character extremely one dimensional. That said, I did feel as if he was a worthy enough opponent in this movie, and I am interested to see the future development of this character.If you're going to see an MCU movie, you most likely care about the action; while ""Quantumania"" didn't have a ton of action in it (the movie focuses more on adventure than action), the action it did have satisfied me. While the action is extremely CGI heavy for the most part, I found it exciting in its sci-fi centricity - it really felt like I was watching a ""Star Trek"" movie, and while some people may not like that, I absolutely loved it.Overall, I had a fantastic time with this movie. Audiences seem to be turning on Ant-Man and on the MCU in general, but I found this to be a refreshing take on the genre with its emphasis on pure science-fiction adventure. You may not enjoy this as much as I did, but if you're a Marvel fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a watch.","7/10"
"darkreignn","9 January 2018","Oh my God, what a movie. This is no doubt one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie I have seen in 2017. In my quest to review every ""Star Wars"" movie, I decided the next logical thing to do was to watch ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" and I'm so happy I did.Advertised as a straight-up action flick, ""War"" is anything but. Yes, it opens with an amazingly directed action sequence where a group of human military combatants attack an ape base that is located in the deep words, but that is pretty much the only ""big"" action sequence until the very end of the film, and even then the action is more of a way to further the story rather than something thrown in there for the audience to marvel at and enjoy. Because of this, I can see why the user reviews for this film on IMDB are absolutely atrocious; 1/10 star reviews plague this movie, with a ton of people saying that this movie is ""insufferable,"" ""boring,"" ""nonsense,"" and ""one of the worst films I've seen in the cinema!"". The reviews among the general audience have been mixed, to say the least. People have said that this movie does not contain a war, that there is little action, and that the previous film had more of a war than this film did. My own cousin even said, ""that movie is not that good, it's actually pretty boring; they should've called it 'one battle for one small piece of the planet of the apes.'"" I would wholeheartedly disagree with every single criticism that has been thrust upon this movie.For one thing, this movie is a WAR in every sense. If the humans succeed in their goal of eradicating the apes, then the planet will once again belong to them. However, if the apes succeed in their goal of surviving and stopping the violence that the humans seem all too eager to engage in, then they will be able to survive and live in peace without worry of being slaughtered. Sure, there may not be set-piece after set-piece of violent combat, but there doesn't need to be; from the opening scene, the stakes are made explicitly clear as the humans trek through the woods with ""monkey killer"" written on their helmets.And when it comes to the killing, all of the action in this movie is filmed beautifully, artfully. The opening battle sequence left my jaw on the floor with its mixture of aerial and wide shots; everything was shown clearly, without any form of shaky camera. There is no doubt that the action in this movie is amazing, but just because this movie is not constant action from beginning to end doesn't mean that this movie isn't riveting from start to finish. I legitimately don't understand how, after watching the first 20 minutes of this movie, one would not be 100% engaged in the goings on of the film's world. Seeing Caesar's motivation for wanting to track down Woody Harrelson's character is truly heartbreaking and you can't help but root for Caesar to obtain his goal, but at the same time you do see where Woody Harrelson's character is coming from as a colonel.The acting and the CGI are of course, as with the previous 2 films, top notch. Woody Harrelson and Andy Serkis do an incredible job and both give emotional performances. Surprisingly, Amiah Miller also gives a subtle and sweet performance as a child who has lost the ability to speak. Everyone in this movie, whether they be ape or human, does a very good job and the CGI is so lifelike that you will honestly forget that you're not watching animals. I literally don't have a single bad thing to say about this movie, and because of that I am not sure why I am not giving this film a perfect score of 10/10. I adored this movie with all my heart, but I base my ratings out of my gut feelings, and my gut told me to score this film a 9/10, so that is my final rating. If I had to give a reason, I would say that this movie is not as good as the first two films of the trilogy, but it is no doubt a strong sendoff that I will always remember fondly, much like how I remember the first two movies fondly. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an emotionally resonant film and a fantastic ending to one of the best movie trilogies of all time. The clear and slick directing will captivate you as soon as the film starts, and Caesar's struggle for revenge while trying to keep hold of his humanity will keep you engaged until the very end; this movie is an action movie, but it is also a very human drama, which is ironic because the main characters happen to be apes.9/10 (Review available to read on my blog - if interested, please click on my account and follow the link to my blog!)","4/10"
"Darksidecrew","30 June 2023","We are back for the fifth and most likely final Indiana Jones film. I will say off the bat that I do not agree with any of the early negative buzz.The film starts in the mid 1940s with the de-aged Harrison Ford. This portion of the film was much longer than expected as I expected it to be a minor flashback but it's quite a lengthy entree. The de-aging is good but not as good as the still pictures would have you believe. It suffers with certain movements and in certain lighting. That said, some sections look phenomenal. However it is the current day Harrison Ford voice coming out of the young Indiana Jones face and he walks like an old Harrison from time to time too. However I really enjoyed it and got caught up in it that I think I could easily take a whole film of it.Then the film shifts to current day Indiana Jones in 1969 and looks gorgeous. Some people were critical of Mangolds direction but I think he did a great job. The acting is great also except the child actor who I thought was subpar.The third act may be too much for some people but in context of the series it is less over the top than crystal skull and a bit more out there than the original trilogy endings. It was a great rousing adventure and kept the tradition going of the odd numbered Indiana Jones films being the good ones and that the nazi villains being in the good ones also.","7/10"
"DarkVulcan29","12 June 2023","A lot of films seem to be exploring multiverses, and superhero films are no exception. An awesome follow up. The animation has a joyfull comic book feel to it. And not to mention the awesome voices to the characters bring incredible life to the characters.I liked the look of the other spider man from other universes. And Miles and Gwen really click, you buy there connection like from the first one. Still hoping for a live action Miles Morales and Spider Gwen movies. I like the main villain, you feel bad for him, and you understand why he does what he does. I'm really looking forward to the next film, it has an ending like The Empire Strikes Back(1980).","8/10"

And while some ape comrades join Caeser on his path, Caeser wonders will he become has bad as the colonial.Andy Serkis really gives another good as Caeser, a very good motion capture performance. Woody Harrelson also steals some scenes has the bad guy, when you look into his eyes you really see madness, but there is one scene where his character explains why he does what he does, and that I believe should get Harrelson an Oscar nomination, cause he was so riveting. At times the movie feels like a two part, one part revenge drama, and second part escape drama. The other actors in motion capture suits also do well when acting has smart apes. I feel the ending really sets up for the 1968 film starring Charlton Heston.","6/10"

The villains here are so annoyingly smug you'll be waiting for Statham to get at them. Josh Hutcherson plays his role pretty well, acting like he is high part of the time, and Jeremy Irons is also good, although very little is done with him. My only complaint is that it ends in a typical Jason Statham way, kind of leaving it open for a sequel, maybe I was hoping for something different. But stil an entertaining action thriller.","8/10"

Although it does drag in spots, too the point where I was dozing a little, but it then it picks up. I think this is the best film of 2012, I hope it won't be missed by the Oscars.

"DarkVulcan29","30 June 2023","I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end.","6/10"
"darkwizard404","17 January 2024","This is the kind of action film Jason Statham is famous for. This is him doing what he does best. It was intense from start to finish. What I really liked about this movie is how the story unfolded. It has a nice beekeeping element attached to it which adds a beautiful flavour to the story.The director David Ayer has made some really good movies in the past like Harsh Times, End of Watch and Fury and this is one is yet another great movie from him. He knew exactly what kind of story he wanted to tell and he was able to do it nicely.This movie is about taking down scammers, which is a concept that wasn't touched yet until now. Glad a movie like this is made since phishing scam has become extremely widespread these days. To the Indians, this movie is for you people.","7/10"
"datautisticgamer-74853","25 January 2019","As someone who watched the entirety of TFS's abridged Dragon Ball Z, I guess I could consider myself an on-and-off fan of the Dragon Ball franchise. For that reason, I was near-captivated by the thought of seeing this movie at my local AMC. My (brief) opinion?At times, the plot felt a little too eager to get to the action scenes, though the action is trademark Dragon Ball: with well-crafted effects and general unpredictability, the animation really helps bring out the action scenes. The writing is occasionally hilarious, but mostly it does a fine job of developing its ""new"" characters. Unfortunately, it doesn't really develop Goku, Vegeta, or some of the other returning characters, as if Toei assumed the audience knew who they were. But that's the thing about anime films like this; they were made for fans. So while it is understandable where Toei was going, it still would have been nice to see a brief time lapse of how other characters like Bulma came to be where they are in the film.For casual audiences, this may very well be worth your time with its action, surprisingly wonderful animation, and insightful backstories on Broly, Paragus, and a few others. For families, do keep in mind that since it's a Funimation dub, they kept most of the language and violence intact from the original Japanese version. On the other hand, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy this film if you are a Dragon Ball fan. Hey, at least it's better than Evolution, right?","7/10"
"dave_maguire","19 February 2023","So I'd seen articles saying that hits film had received the lowest score for a marvel film, but was sure this couldn't be correct - after all, we've all seen Love and Thunder haven't we!So I went in with an open mind and upon finishing the film I was left with an unsure feeling about the film. Ant man is great character and I've enjoyed his films and appearances so far in the MCU, and all of these have been quite lighthearted, which makes me feel that the more I think about it, the more I feel that he is the wrong character to introduce the ""new big bad"" into the MCU. Don't get me wrong, given the setting I'm not sure who else could, but the tone of the film is more serious as a result of it, which doesn't seem to fit an Ant man film.It not without its good points of course, Paul Rudd is.... Paul Rudd, and that's never a bad things and he plays the plays the part great yet again, and some of the supporting cast are good also, Michael Douglas was bearable for a change, and I found Evangeline Lily to once again okay the Wasp well. Thee were some some action scenes in it and I found the CGI landscapes seemed to be visually stunning in places, and even though it maybe wasn't all great, to say this film was largely based on green screen, overall it was good.Unfortunately the film was let down by a few things, pacing being one of them as it is all over the place, which causes this to film to drag...a lot, especially in the middle section. There are also a few plot holes and issues that let the film down also. Many surrounding Janet:1. We were told she was alone in the quantum realm, yet she evidently spent years in there fighting a maniacal tyrant..... this never came up in conversation when she was home? Even when they decide to farm quantum particles at the end of the last ant man? Heads up might've been nice for Scott?2. If you're helping Cassie (who is apparently now also a technical genius???) build a machine to study the realm, maybe point out the dangers of it before she does something like this - don't tell her it's an empty realm then have a go at her for building it.3. When you're IN the realm and your family find out something is going on - tell them! None of this ""trust me"" ""there is no time"" crap!Also, I was under the impression, and could be wrong out this, that the suit protected the wearing when shrinking/enlarging, so I'm unsure why Scott and Cassie can take their helmets off, mid battle also, and it not affect them?Unfortunately for me, the main issues were the villains. M. O. D. O. K was never going to be an easy villain to show in live action - unfortunately some characters don't transfer well from page to screen, such as Galactus, so he was never going to look great, but it was the portrayal of him what was more annoying as, despite being feared as a hunter by the locals, he was purely played for laughs through the whole film. He was done better in the Avengers game! But for me the worst one was Kang! I guess the credits scenes show this character was somewhat of a red herring regarding being the ""next Thanos threat"", but this guy couldn't even lace his boots! At no point did we get any indication of his power or threat level, and gets beat rather easily by a regular human man who ""talks to ants"". I honestly expected some of the main cast to be killed in order to put across the threat level but no, everyone is fine - no trouble! Even after Scott and Hope seemingly get trapped in the quantum realm - oh hang on, let me just turn the machine back on... sorted!Also, the whole mulitiverse Kang situation doesn't entirely make much sense to me - so ""He who remains"" was worried of what would come if he got killed, which we all assume was this Kang we saw, who advises that he needs to get out of the realm and warned of what would happen if he didn't, but now he got killed, all the other variants, who banished him for trying to kill them all, decide now that Humans have killed him, they should kill the humans??? Huh?? What?? It really makes no sense?! To me, Kang would be better served just being the antagonist in the Loki series instead.So as always, it's sometimes easier to point out negatives than positives so it probably sounds like I hate this film, it's not perfect, but it's better than some of the more recent efforts.","7/10"
"dave-1205","12 January 2024","The film's narrative hinges on outlandish scenarios and unbelievable action, often veering into unintentionally humorous territory due to its sheer absurdity of specific sequences.While films, even those with mature content, can offer immersive experiences, 'The Beekeeper' falls short. Its graphic elements ('18' UK, 'R' US) juxtaposed with its stretched plot create a tonal disconnect that alienates its intended audience, leaving viewers unable to suspend disbelief.While the film delivers the genre's requisite action sequences, the plot struggles to maintain credibility, often indulging in exaggerated scenarios that feel more amateurish than polishedStepping out of a well-crafted movie is like emerging from a captivating dream, your mind buzzing with the story's echoes. Sadly, ""The Beekeeper"" left me thoroughly indifferent.","6/10"
"dave-mcclain","14 July 2017","""War! What is it good for?"" soul singer Edwin Starr famously asked in 1970. Since the song came out at the height of the Vietnam War, it's doubtful that humans fighting apes for control of the planet is what Starr had in mind. Or maybe it was. Two years earlier, legendary actor Charlton Heston starred in the film that launched a franchise. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" told the story of a group of astronauts who landed on a planet inhabited by apes that could talk and humans that couldn't, only to discover (50-year-old spoiler alert) that the planet was earth in the distant future. In that case, the humans had clearly lost and earth had become a planet of apes. Then, a series of early 1970s prequels and sequels told the story of how that happened and what were the long-term repercussions of all of it. Next up (deliberately skipping over the silly 2001 remake), 2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" introduced Movie Fans to a pet chimp named Caesar who learned to talk and later led a rebellion against his human oppressors. In 2014, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" more clearly drew the battle lines between apes and humans, while 2017's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (PG-13, 2:20) takes that conflict to a whole new level and shows us a war that's at least good for determining who will dominate the entire planet.As this film opens, the intelligent talking chimpanzee known as Caesar (performed for the third time by Andy Serkis, again via motion capture technology) is fully in charge of the colony of apes living in the woods of northern California and dealing with the fall-out from the events of the previous film. The humans' numbers continue to diminish due to the Simian Flu, which is caused by ALZ-113, the same drug which caused the apes to develop human-like intelligence and gave some the ability to speak. As if that weren't bad enough, the virus has mutated, causing people who catch it to lose the power of speech and regress to a more primitive intellect. The humans are also still angry at the apes because of the apes' attack on San Francisco in the last film. In an attempt to preserve what's left of the human race, a rogue military leader known as The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is killing any people whom he suspects of being infected by the virus – while also trying to wipe out the ape population. After repelling one attack by the Colonel's forces, Caesar sends the survivors back to their camp with the message that leaving the apes alone in the woods could stop the fighting between ape and man. But the apes are also making plans to migrate across a vast wasteland to a distant location where they can live in peace.After an even more devastating attack by the Colonel and his men, the apes set out in search of that new home, but Caesar won't go with them. He's grown angry, bitter and vengeful and has decided to go after the Colonel personally, but Caesar's trusted lieutenants, Rocket (Terry Notary), Maurice (Karin Konoval) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) insist on coming to help. Along the way, they join forces with another talking chimpanzee called Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) and pick up a young, orphaned mute girl whom they start calling Nova (Amiah Miller). When the group finds the Colonel's camp, they are horrified to discover that his soldiers have captured and enslaved the ape community that had left the woods and are now forcing them to build a wall around the camp. This begs the question as to what or whom the Colonel is worried about keeping out, but also sets up a battle of wits between him and Caesar and a struggle for survival between apes and humans which seems destined to culminate in an epic battle.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a fantastic movie which represents the culmination of one terrific trilogy. This ""Planet of the Apes"" series established an interesting and layered mythology that continues to build on itself and get better and better as it develops. The third movie is influenced by many earlier films from various genres and decades, but is perhaps best understood as a combination of the classics ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and (especially) ""The Ten Commandments"". The intricate plotting by returning scribes Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves makes for an engrossing film that is filled with rich symbolism and important lessons for all of us real-life talking primates. Reeves is also back in the director's chair and again gives us a well-paced story full of action, excitement, suspense and heart. Last, but not least, the visual effects and acting are every bit as outstanding as in the previous two films (if not better) – especially when it comes to the motion capture performances, particularly that of Serkis. (And would the movie awards community please FINALLY recognize motion capture performances simply as PERFORMANCES, as worthy of accolades for excellence as any other, whether accomplished through prosthetics, from within intricate costumes and hair-styling or just with the simple but skillful use of the voice, face and body!) Now, returning to the question asked at the beginning of this review, what is war good for? In this case, one exceptional film. ""A""","7/10"

But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects.

"davidgee","25 July 2017","Not a lot to say about this. There's a limit to how much magic today's over-done CGI can inject into to a franchise that's run out of steam. Caesar (Andy Serkis), the thinking man's King Kong, takes the last band of apes to a mining colony run by the vicious Colonel Woody Harrelson, where Caesar's son is among the prisoners. The war is not just between the slave-apes and their masters (humans and 'collaborator' gorillas) but also between the colony and another army of humans who've survived the apocalyptic virus.There are pleasing nods to other movies outside the genre. Some early snowscape panoramas reminded me of David Lean's awesome cinematography in DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, and the prison colony is a cross between Mad Max's THUNDERDOME and Kurtz's jungle hideout in APOCALYPSE NOW. Woody Harrelson's 'transition' from monster to misfit makes no sense, and the humanity of the 'good' apes contrasted to the inhumanity of the humans is ladled on much too thickly. The sequels to the 1968 Charlton Heston PLANET OF THE APES became progressively dafter, so we must hope they shelve the franchise back in the studio archive for a decade or two now that this remake trilogy is complete.","8/10"
"davidgee","4 January 2013","You already know the story. Emigrating to Canada with his family on a rust-bucket freighter, an Indian zoo-keeper's son is the sole survivor when the ship goes down in a storm. Not quite the sole survivor: he shares his lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orang-utang . . . and a magnificent Bengal tiger improbably named Richard Parker. Mr Parker soon eats his companions, apart from young Pi Patel who retreats to a raft made of debris strung out behind the lifeboat. They survive on the lifeboat's rations and some fortuitous fish catches until they beach on a floating island populated by mongooses (not mongeese, I just looked it up). Over time they reach an uneasy truce, but the script is at pains not to sentimentalise their relationship.Apart from Rafe Spall as the writer to whom the adult Pi is telling his tale (and a cameo by Gerard Depardieu), all the cast are Indians. Suraj Sharma, who plays the castaway Pi, is not one of those preposterously handsome Asian stars, he's quite ordinary looking (actually I was reminded of an Indian version of Labour leader Ed Milliband!) but as natural an actor as SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE's Dev Patel. The animals are mostly CGI but very believable, especially the fabulous Richard Parker. The storm scenes are spectacular; in 3D you almost need to put an umbrella up.The movie is perhaps a tad too long, but it's never tedious. The feeling of being taken on an adventure rarely lets up. Full marks to Ang Lee, a director whose career has taken many a crowd-pleasing turn. This is a magical alternative to the Christmas pantomime.","9/10"

Matt Reeves follows up one of the best big budget special effects driven films of the last decade with a very good film that understands where the central character needs to go next.It's been several years since the events of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Caesar has been running a guerilla war against the remnants of the US military at his heels. The movie begins with a pitched battle as the military finds the ape refuge and attacks only to get defeated soundly. Caesar has hardened since the war started, but he's still grasping onto his morality, manifested by him letting the few survivors go back to their colonel with a message that the war could end if the humans would simply leave them alone. That, of course, does not come to pass. Instead, the colonel brings in a special ops force to sneak in at night and assassinate Caesar in his sleep, killing Caesar's wife and eldest son instead. This does to Caesar what Koba had wanted from him before his death. Koba saw nothing good in humanity, and now, having felt the terrors of war firsthand and personally, Caesar falls into what Koba had wanted before his death.The new film intelligently keeps Koba around, not as a primary antagonist, but as a ghost who haunts Caesar. The defeat of Koba himself doesn't defeat Koba's ideology. That's something that Caesar must continue to fight long after Koba himself has died. At the death of two members of his family, Caesar falls instantly into that, abandoning the ideological fight that he had won, and seeing nothing but the innate evil of humanity. He sets out on his own (with a few others who refuse to be left behind) to kill the colonel himself while the rest of the herd moves off to find somewhere else to live, their location having been revealed to the humans.Along the way, they pick up a mute girl, and while the girl herself ends up working really well, I feel like her early introduction, right after Caesar has determined that he has become a Koba-like nihilist, is a bit too obvious. Suddenly, Caesar has a little human girl who could never be a real threat to him in his presence right after he picked up his anti-human feelings. Well, yeah, she's going to be one of the primary vessels to get him out of it, why do you ask? They also end up meeting a new ape, one who has no connection to the group but still can speak and has the increased intelligence of the rest, Bad Ape, a former denizen of a zoo who's been barely surviving just outside of humanity's reach and knows of the likely place where the colonel went to.What's interesting about the human characters in this, the third of the rebooted Apes franchise, is that the humans are possibly even more interesting than the apes for the first time. The Colonel is a version of Colonel Kurtz in the movie's most obvious reference to Apocalypse Now. He's a madman who's seen things that his superiors haven't. They don't understand, and, what makes him most interesting, is that he's actually right to a great degree. His effort to destroy the apes isn't driven by hatred, but by a change in the nature of the conflict that Caesar doesn't even realize has happened. The virus that wiped out most of humanity and made the apes smart has mutated and started making humans no more than beasts. It's not a clash of civilizations, it's a fight for humanity's survival, and no one has realized it yet other than him. To add to the character, Woody Harrelson is absolutely electric as The Colonel. He's quiet, intelligent, zealous in his belief, and cruel all at once. His scenes with Caesar are the absolute height of the film as Caesar steadily gets to know the man he wants to kill.Caesar's hatred, though, gets balanced with the fact that The Colonel found the herd and captured them, forcing them to build a wall at the abandoned weapons depot. He can't simply act on his own emotions despite moving in ways designed to separate himself from responsibility. Instead he finds himself grounded by his own people, no matter what he tries. He can't completely descend into Koba's viewpoint. He still has a small son to worry about.It comes down to the conflict between The Colonel, who's taking a by any means necessary approach to a fight he knows he losing, and Caesar, who was willing to take a similar approach in a fight he had thought he had already lost, that is the center of the film. Perhaps the best scene is when the conflict comes to an end, and Caesar cannot take his vengeance anymore. It's a mixture of pity, anger, and relief that goes across Caesar's perfectly rendered digital face, and it shows him a different way forward, one that helps him purge himself of Koba's ghost completely.War for the Planet of the Apes is steeped in the history of the franchise, using elements such as Nova, Charlton Heston's voice, the Alpha and Omega symbols from Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and the human muteness as building blocks in a story about Caesar's final journey into leadership and personhood. It also intelligently uses movies of the past, particularly Apocalypse Now, as inspiration for how to tell this story, going beyond parody and firmly entering homage while standing on its own two feet. I suppose my only small problem is the early use of Nova, though I do appreciate how she gets used later. Still, the movie is a very good final chapter to this new Apes trilogy.","10/10"
"Davor_Blazevic_1959","3 January 2013","With his latest movie, ""Life of Pi"", Ang Lee further establishes himself as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors. Starting from his Taiwanese beginnings, and his highly enjoyable, family-harmonizing ""Father Knows Best"" trilogy (1992-1994), through his Academy Award winning works on gracefully choreographed, highly spiritualized Far East martial arts tour de force ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000, best foreign-language film) and on an uncommon yet nostalgic portrayal of the Old West in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005, best director), to his other titles like ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995), ""The Ice Storm"" (1997), and ""Lust, Caution"" (2007), quality and Kubrick-like versatility shown in his movies offer continuous attraction for wide audience of his admirers.Lee's latest and, so far, easily, greatest movie, ""Life of Pi"" is based on a screenplay adapted from the acclaimed fictional adventure novel written by Canadian author Yann Martel.Throughout his childhood, due to matching pronunciation of French word ""piscine"" (pool, swimming pool) and English word ""pissing"", Piscine Molitor Patel, named that way after later abandoned Parisian swimming pool, so predictably suffers from being nicknamed ""Pissing Patel"". In order to avoid it, once in high school he finally shortens his name to Pi Patel... Nowadays middle-aged Pi tells the story of his life to a visiting writer, apparently a book author Yan Martel's alter ego, who is seeking for the literal inspiration. Retrospectively, Pi divides his childhood and adolescence into three segments. In the first segment he gives shorter account of his life until the age of 16, describing his interaction with his family and schoolmates, in particular his relationship with his father and a girlfriend, concentrating on his exploits of God and spirituality, meandering between multitude of religious practices while in the last one he briefs about his testimonial given to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, investigating the reasons why the ship his family was relocating on from India to Canada sank. Most detailed, and therefore the longest, is recollection of his 227 days in a lifeboat, an extraordinary ordeal he went through after the ship has capsized and everybody else, crew and passengers, died Well, everybody human, but not everybody living. Namely, a number of terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo, offered for sale and brought along with other family belongings, have survived, too. But, not for long, because, while confined in the most limited space as they were, surrounded by vastness of the ocean, the law of the ""survival of the fittest"" prevails, takes its tall, and pretty soon Pi finds himself in a company of a single one topping the food-chain, a Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker. Not to reveal the story further, it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories: in an engaging tale—whether allegory or depiction of realistic, believable events, filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity, imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts, encouraging the same in viewers—of an uncommon character, indeed, brought to on-screen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads, remarkably presented via ubiquitous, yet inconspicuous animation, exceptional, CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography, all along complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, complex yet basic, difficult yet simple, initially charged with Pi's dreadful fear, swiftly shifting to respectful care, instantly boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive survival techniques 16-year old Pi uses—amply benefiting from his instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son, certainly well acquainted with animal psychology—to suppress the fear and convincingly impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate ""killing machines"" among mammals, desperately striving for his own survival, nevertheless, generously, for survival of his seemingly sufficiently tamed companion, but still, initially and ultimately, magnificent adversary, Richard Parker, as well.""Life of Pi"" is, certainly, one of the most impressive movies of 2012, year that has just come to a close.","10/10"
"davyjones-636363","26 November 2021","This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.","10/10"
"DaytonaBob","17 January 2019","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.","2/10"
"dbogosian-1","24 November 2012","Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.But regardless, this movie redefines the word ""beautiful."" I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.","8/10"
"dburris-45933","4 June 2023","It's not very often we get an animation film like this...The art is astounding, colorful visuals, a jaw dropping movie phenomenon. The score and songs flow very well, the acting is on par with new additional characters involved...Some we may know, and some we haven't seen on screen yet. The plot of the story is well thought out. Has its silly moments without taking away the essence of the story. Has a very dark tone. This is a movie is aimed not only for children but for comic fans and adults alike. They really achieved movie history and everyone involved did a stiller job! One of the best Spider-Man movies thus far!","6/10"
"dcarsonhagy","27 October 2017","Believe it or not, I debated for a long time as to whether or not I was going to watch this. I found the original (in this genre's reboot) to be better than the original, but found its sequel to be simply boring, overrated, and almost unwatchable. And then, there's the third installment.I cannot believe how involved I became in this film. I found the writing, the story, the pace, the directing--everything--to be leaps and bounds above the other two films. The casting for this film was perfect. What really blew me away, though, was the actual story. Everything is tied up and all questions answered in the third chapter. What's even more amazing is it all makes sense! When the film opens, the humans are trying to flush out Caesar and his minions. After years of battle, it seems a certain faction of the humans have found a Messiah; someone who will lead them to the retaking of their land. Known only as ""The Colonel,"" and delightfully portrayed by Woody Harrellson, I cannot think of too many characters on film I have despised more. On his way in search of The Colonel, Caesar begins to discover something may not be right in the community of humans.Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and torture, this is one of the best films of this year. I highly recommend it.","10/10"
"dcdude-26988","3 June 2023","This has to be a top three movie/film for me personally. Just let me explain why before you are gonna go like, ""Top 3?!"". The whole movie literally explains in every reason why most Spider-Men in different demensions have the same exact storyline and background stories. A spiderman gets bit, falls in love, and then has a loved one die. That is what happens in every Spider-Man story, and this film literally explains it to us all. Not to mention, the whole storyline about Gwen relates to as of why she cares about Miles alot. Anyways, the animation has to be some of the best animation that we have seen so far, and the visuals were amazing as well. The film is kind of mind controlable at the same time, and here is why before you ask. At first, the movie was like, ""Why are you showing all of this so slowly"", but then, at some of the ending parts, it literally explains why they were. Speaking of ending parts, the plot twists were amazing as well. Some of them are like, ""oh, I get it"", and others were like ""WHAT?!"", which means that this movie was able to balance it very well. In my opinion, I think that this and the previous represent and show how the multiverse works alot better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ever done.","10/10"

"dcortner-19918","10 January 2024","The best Marvel movie to date IMO. Fantastic all-around. The pacing was spot on, and I was very concerned about it going in. I thought I'd be feeling bored or dragging around the 2hr mark. But when Thanos reached Wakanda, I knew things were ending soon and I actually remember thinking I didn't want it to end.The cast were all stellar in their roles. Love Cap's new look. Really enjoyed seeing RDJ back on-screen as Iron Man as well. Tom Holland really surprised me with how emotional that Spider-Man death scene was. The ""I don't want to go"" got to me.I thought we'd get some exposition or the Avengers reuniting in some capacity first, but I'm glad we opened with a Thanos attack. It helped establish the pace and set the tone. The movie kept that tone throughout. Thanos is a badass, but I also really enjoyed seeing his backstory and character. In his own twisted way, he definitely did care for Garmora. The relief on his face at the end was a really strong moment. He completed his goal, in his eyes he's done the universe a great justice and now he can just relax.I do hope that at least Loki & Gamora stay dead. I understand those that vanished are going to come back but I think bringing those 2 back would be a bit extreme.I thought for sure Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers were going to bite the bullet in this one. But it just makes me that much more intrigued to see where things go from here.Also, I have to shoutout the score. The music in this film was incredible. I'm not familiar with Alan Silvestri but he did an amazing job. The score enhanced every single scene, and helped immerse me into this world. Fantastic work.","9/10"
"dcpacker","1 February 2019","As someone who has grown up with Dragon Ball, I have enjoyed the many episodes and films that the franchise has offered over the decades, but this one takes the cake... Let me tell you why.The final fight is something to behold. As I was watching, I assumed a small scuffle was going to take place, with the final fight coming later on in the film. I was wrong! With amazing animation, a great soundtrack by Norihito Sumitomo, and powerful sound effects, we are treated to not only the best fight in the franchise (in my opinion), but also one of the best fights i've seen in anime in general. It kicks straight into high gear and just keeps getting more intense. I personally rate it up there with such great anime fight scenes as Ichigo versus Aizen in Bleach, and Kakashi versus Obito in Naruto Shippuden.If you're a dragon ball/anime fan and enjoy a good fight scene, this is a must see film.","10/10"
"DeadMan66","6 October 2017","Good and interesting movie. Glad I watched it. Story is simple and straight forward. It is the sequel of earlier Ape movies of Caesar. Writing any sentence about the story line is like spoiling the movie. So I will keep it short.Movie is worth watching. I enjoyed every frame of movie. Movie includes sentiments, emotion and revenge. I don't think any more sequel will be made of it. Movie is long, of 2 hours so you have to be patience and keep watching to know the end.","1/10"
"DeadMansTrousers","14 June 2023","I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.","6/10"
"deastman_uk","28 April 2018","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","10/10"
"declanleader","8 September 2019","Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one.","10/10"
"deepfrieddodo","26 May 2023","Bringing the wise-cracking Avenger back to centre stage, Quantumania shares the spotlight with the wider Lang/Pym family, in a film that is enjoyable, if not unsuccessful in it's attempt to match the drama of all recent MCU releases. It's fun, but could also be likened to Spy-Kids.A strange tone is struck. The early stages are full of the humour from the previous two instalments, but the main plot is dove into fairly immediately and it doesn't take long for severity to ensue. Having Kang as the villain matches that, but backed up by M. O. D. O. K. Felt like a goofy combination, where a scene cannot be taken seriously with a giant floating head (with off-putting CGI) hanging around in the background. He's not necessarily a bad character, and certainly one who needed to be approached as a light-hearted sideshow, but one that doesn't suit the 'epic' consequence of the end of a civilisation/world/universe.Whilst they're all part of the same universe, and this does take place in a setting only really applicable to Ant-Man and the Wasp, Quantumania does lose a little of it's trilogy's identity. The plot may be heavily tied into the wider MCU saga, but the previous two in the trilogy still had that odd-man-out feel to it in a superhero world. This could have easily been a Guardians of the Galaxy film, complete with comically odd creatures, or any of the Avengers films where an ensemble take on an all-powerful being.That said, Rudd is still great as Lang, and the rest of the cast, far more involved in the plot, match the tone and atmosphere well. The CGI looks good for the most part, even if it is a little sad that the whole film is 90% greenscreen. I can't imagine this will be anyone's favourite film, but it's entertaining and contributes massively to the wider Marvel story.","7/10"

"Dello_","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","9/10"
"deloudelouvain","25 December 2023","When I saw they released this new Indiana Jones movie I thought it was the perfect moment to rewatch the other four adventures. They all aged very well, very pleasant to rewatch, still as entertaining as the first time I watched them. I scored them all with an eight on here. So I was quite excited to see what Harrison Ford's mission would be this time. I mean he's not the youngest anymore but with some amazing computer tools they managed to make him look young again. It's quite scary they can do all this so easily nowadays, makes you wonder what you can believe or who can be trusted in the future as everything can be manipulated easily. This new adventure is of course again over the top but does this really matter with an Indiana Jones movie? If you can pass all that and you enjoyed the previous movies I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this one. So I really don't get some negative reviews for this one. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is this time the other main character and she did quite good. Antonio Banderas only has a very small role and was more a name on a poster, to attract more people, than anything else, but he still did a good job. I guess this time it was the last Indiana Jones movie, unless they can just film a movie with a complete fake Harrison Ford in the future, or if another actor plays his character. Indiana Jones is to me one of the most successful franchises, five movies, five great adventures.","6/10"
"delusions_of_greed","22 January 2019","Let me start by stating that I'm a HUGE Dragon Ball fan! So needless to say, I was very excited about this movie, but it absolutely did not live up to my expectations. The plot was definitely better and made more sense than the original and the action was INCREDIBLE, but outside of that, the movie was...... dumb. They had so many opportunities to make the movie interesting, but they chose to cut corners and go with the most stereotypical plots. And the music. My God, the music was hysterical. In a bad way. At first you don't notice it, but once you get into the real action it does this hilarious Deadpool 2 thing where they sing ""Broly"" in an epic manner, but the biggest difference between DP2 and Broly is that DP2 intentionally made it funny, but DBS tried to make it serious and it turned out to be one of the things I laughed at the loudest. And the end.... Let's just say, I see what they plan on doing, but it was the most cop out way to end it. All in all, the movie is not good. Go into it with low expectations and maybe you'll enjoy it, but the action scenes and animation were it's only saving grace.","10/10"
"demonblade-37792","19 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion.","5/10"
"demonblade-37792","5 June 2023","The first impression of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is that the cinematography is visually stunning. The artwork and animations of the characters and backgrounds are pleasing to watch. Kudos to the artist team who put the hard work in. I loved how we saw almost and if not every Spider-Person from all the universes. My personal favorite was Spider-Punk being played by Daniel Kaluuya because he is a punk-rock character, but also still chill and nonchalant at the same time. It was glad seeing Miles Morales (Shamiek Moore) back in action as his and also Spider-Gwen's (Hailee Steinfield) stories dissolve all into one movie. It was nice to see that we have strong antagonists being played by Spot (Jason Schwartzman) and Spider-Man 2099/ Miguel O' Hara (Oscar Isaac). Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is great with its voice acting, cinematography, and the story. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","10/10"

Everyone tremble at the mere mention of his name. And he can dispatch pretty much anybody with super badass moves unless he reach his target. Sounds familiar? Everything in the structure of the movie, even to the ""special organization using outdated tech that somehow can find everything"", is very similar to John Wick. The bee theme is likely the only thing that is remotely original.But as i said in the intro, its not a negative for me. I like those action movies that were inspired by John Wick and if done properly like in this case, i would take a lot more. The story is simple but coherent, having Jason Statham as the lead assure a solid screen presence, the action is very good, and the movie as little timeoffs clocking at only 100 minutes or so. Its one of those solid action movies where you just buckle up for the ride and before you can even realize it, the movie is over.I don't buy as much movies on physical format these days as i used to, but its one that i will add to the collection. And i really hope they make sequels.","8/10"
"devendralilke","21 August 2023","Miles Morales's story to the next part which traverses through the multiverse. The huge faults create a gigantic messed up cracks and fissures in the symmetrical flow of the timeline. The absolutely astonishing visual style of animation owns this film and teleports it to the place where no other film has reached. This film is bonkers in catering countless creative choices in its every fascinating frame, each looks like a spectacle at best. The graphics and artwork creatively screams and mellows us with its perfect comic style representation. The mega chase sequence with the spider society is an amusing ride. The action sequences are rushing pulses which standout and validify the reason why we shall blow our minds in front of the big screen. The creation team and art team of this film outperforms the first installment and establishes a benchmark for the future of animation. The humour and emotions find a way in this splendid world. The storytelling and narration is well webbed in the long pacing. Miles Morales's appealing storyline is intertwined with multiple other plots across the spider-verse. Gwen's character is a shining lamplight. All the other spideys from different worlds make a place to form the intriguing exploration of the multiverse. The spot is really an unique character choice to add on in the multiverse trajectory. Miles Morales's bond with his parents is an inspiration upon which the story finds a heart and soul. In here also, there is this fate of spiderman, that he or she has to make a sacrifice to withhold the power that flows in him. As every time, the stirring and insightful words from the mentors of spiderman thrives that matters in every storyline to serve the purpose that every superhero needs. The film often softens from its epic tone like a subtle colour to penetrate the bulky ambition and poignant emotions it carries. Probably the finest Spidey film to date. It ends with a cliffhanger, promising a beyond trek. Indeed, this film is a fabulous work of art that reminds us that there is no frontier to creation. It has just pulled us into its world of millions of our own-selves...","10/10"
"devesh070","23 November 2012","movie is great no doubt but story is not strong. If you watch this movie for special effect than you can give this movie 10 out of 10. Start and end of the movie is boring for the 5- 10 minutes. All over movie with splendid special effect it become great movie.If you are animal channel lover you really like his movie. In whole movie hero try to survive in the sea with tiger all alone. Then there is strange island come with many meerkat nice to see that island totally special in this movie. But most of the special effect are already shown in the promo of the movie. So, great movie must watch movie at least once you must watch.","2/10"
"dezsokekovacs","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","5/10"
"dfle3","15 January 2013","I can't say that I was very excited to see this movie but I thought I'd give it a shot and found it very rewarding. In fact, it has repeat viewing value, given the ending. What surprised me most, perhaps, was the wit and humour in the dialogue. Not having read the book on which it was based, I have nothing else to compare it to, and found the story worked well as a spectacle...of which there are many.Without giving too much away, the story concerns the life and adventures of Pi Patel. We see him as a small boy and as an adult recounting the adventure most of us would be familiar with via the commercials for this film...himself as a teenager (played well by Suraj Sharma) adrift at sea, with a wild tiger as both a constant threat to him yet a constant but uneasy companion. Most of the movie is set at sea and here the cinematography (which I saw in 3D) is absolutely magnificent. You really do feel a sense of the infinite as Pi drifts endlessly on an endless ocean. Even some of the urban settings in Pi's childhood do have a wonderful picture postcard quality to them.Another contender for most surprising aspect to this movie was the theme of religion. I just did not expect this to be part of this movie, for whatever reason. In a way the movie is about religion. Or stories. A story about stories, in other words. Some professional reviews do mention the issue of how to interpret the movie. Maybe it is a parable? Could it be like a dream, requiring Freud to make sense of it? In these interpretative strategies there is the problem of mapping one thing from the sea adventure to some other thing from Pi's ordinary life. And doing that to account for everything. The desire to do so is powerful but the adult Pi does comment near the end of the movie about the merits of this procedure.Some professional reviews I've seen criticise the narrative device of having an adult Pi interviewed by a writer. Since I don't know whether this was in the book or not, I can say that it wasn't so much of an issue for me. There was a concern before I saw this movie that it might come across like one of Kamahl's commercials for a certain brand of tea, but it worked well for me. The writer (played by Rafe Spall) functions as an 'everyman' asking the kind of questions the curious audience might want to ask. Being a literal minded person, I did really appreciate the writer's attempt to interpret Pi's sea adventure...it is that titbit of information which gives the movie repeat viewing value...I had expected to give this movie 80%, but it's this potential repeat viewing value which bumps my score up to 85+%.Special mention should be given to the special effects in this movie. It's great. Having this volatile mix of carnivores and herbivores on Pi's boat interact with each other in a believable way was admirably achieved. At times the tiger seemed to be a CGI creation, but maybe I was wrong on that? It's very rare that you think these special effects don't feel quite right.It was a surprise to me to see so many young children watching this movie at the cinema. Appropriately, perhaps, the animal life cycle was sanitised on the boat...there is no great gore to speak of, but there are some dark themes verbalised at the end of the movie, which makes me wonder how suitable it is for children. But that darkness houses felt pain, which was another rewarding aspect to this film. It has great humanity.Whilst a movie like ""Seven psychopaths"" is my pick as the most entertaining movie for the year, I don't think I would be allowed to pick that as my choice for best movie. ""Life of Pi"" seems a more intellectual choice to make and I do feel that an award for the best movie of the year would be well deserved, along with awards for cinematography. Ang Lee deserves a nomination for direction too. Suraj Sharma is also worthy of a nomination. This movie is a wonderful spectacle but the tale has hidden depth to it, which makes it ripe for revisiting and seeing it anew. Which viewing would explain the meaning of the movie best? That is the question. When Pi's father states his preference for the scientific story of life, I do wonder whether the movie agrees with him or not...or if there is truth in any story...just preferences for one story over another. Was the other story Pi told the writer true?","10/10"
"dfranzen70","5 January 2013","In Life of Pi, Ang Lee's philosophical spectacle, makes for a fascinating viewing, succeeding on multiple levels of enjoyment. There's the adventure itself, a massive sojourn of a boy in a lifeboat - with a Bengal tiger. And then there's the meaning of the story itself, which is happily left ambiguous. It's also about the spirit and resourcefulness of man, and above all it's about hope and optimism. Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), named after a famous pool in France, is on his way from his home in India with his mother, father, brother, and a lot of animals (the family owns a zoo) aboard a Japanese vessel, bound for Canada. During a particularly terrifying thunderstorm, the ship sinks, and Pi finds himself on a stocked lifeboat with a few of the lucky creatures (none human) and no idea of his location.The animals are inconsequential except for one - the tiger. How does one survive in a lifeboat with an untamed beast who'd love to make a meal out of him? It's not easy, and luckily our Pi is quite resourceful. Rest assured, though, there is no silent understanding between the two, even as hunger and thirst rob each of his strength. They are not friends. They each wish to survive, although a case can be made that Pi, at least, has no intention of harming/eating the tiger.The tiger is not stupid - oh, quite the contrary, he is a cunning brute. He can't be cowed, and he won't allow Pi to have dominion over the lifeboat, which forces our human hero to construct a sort of floating annex to the boat, tethered and filled with supplies.Of great interest to me were the tantalizing, beautiful aquatic scenes. Whether it was the sight of thousands of fish flying through the air at our passengers or a glimpse into the remarkably clear water to see gorgeous - and sometimes quite large - marine life blithely swimming by, there's rarely a slow moment. Picking up the slack in such matters, of course, is how Pi survives, how he keeps his wits about him, how he manages to get by with a ravenous tiger so close by. If you think that Lee is trying to present a moralistic story to us - he touches quite a bit on religion, for example - you are right. But it's not heavy handed by any means. To illustrate this, Pi (as an adult relating his tale to a writer) notes that when he was a young lad in India, he joined up with several different religions, a way to show us that he was having trouble finding his way, choosing the right path. As his father remarks to him at dinner one night, it is fine to be different, but in the end one must choose a path. Net thing you know, Pi is afloat on a raft, drifting aimlessly across the Pacific Ocean. He still had not found his way.In the end, Lee doesn't appear to be trying to teach his audience. He is not moralizing; he is presenting choices and explaining how, in this situation, a single man found his way through life, not simply to survive but to live. This is not a movie about a boy and his pet tiger roaming the seven seas; it's about learning about one's inner self and finding an exciting direction in which to take it. And even apart from the symbolic journey that Pi involuntarily undertakes, there is a second moral quandary posed at the very end that will get the viewer thinking. And that, to me, is the real selling point of this movie. The beauty, the majesty, the excitement of the cross-sea trip is almost surreal - but sufficiently realistic to allow one to enjoy its wonder. Yet that final question, posed by the adult Pi, seals the deal. This is a movie best seen on a large screen, the better to appreciate its epic scope.","10/10"

This is a very unique movie, unlike any you may have seen before. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is compelling, the cinematography breath taking, and the adventure is spellbinding. If that sounds like a fun time at the movies, then this one is for you.I had the good fortune to see this movie in 3D, I'm sure it is good without the 3D effect, but if you have a choice, try 3D as the special effects are nothing less than mind blowing.I loved this one, time seemed to fly by and I didn't want this adventure to end, I'd say that is the true test of a great film.....enjoy!!","10/10"
"dhall-38216","11 July 2019","I am a long time Dragon Ball fan, and as such, have seen most of if not all of the movies. This is not the best one so far, but still better than most. The writing is really solid, and it retcons Broly's origin story to make it much more engaging and believable.
There is a large exposition dump at the beginning so even people unfamiliar with the long history of the series can understand each character, but don't let it turn you off. They're written with clear motivations and it's a very simple but well told story. Again, credit to the writers for the story, even if some things are lost in translation.
My only big problems with it were with the animation and music/sound. The animation that is hand drawn is great as always, but the CGI ""enhancements"" were pretty obvious, but some were implemented very well. This problem is made worse by the extreme movement of the camera, as there is so much movement going on at times, I had no idea what was going on. When the characters are flying around in three dimensions and the camera is also swinging around aggressively, it makes me lose my bearings completely. It's similar to the fight scene in Battle of the Gods, when Beerus fights Goku with his new god powers, but it's poorly done and amplifies the already visually noisy action.
Speaking of noise, that's how I would describe the music. Some is really well done, like the choir being used at dramatic moments, but others made me physically cringe. It's cheesy enough that each character announces their attacks and stuff like that, but now each character has their name poorly incorporated into generic rock music during their action scenes. I'd love to be watching the fight, but hearing the characters' name being ""rock yelled"" in the music is very distracting. It happens for literally every character that powers up and fights. Imagine if it had some peaceful music with some dummy singing ""Piccollo..."" when they visit him in his quiet wasteland. Well the reality of what they did is just as stupid. The sound design could be better too, maybe give each strike and explosion a little more oomph.
Overall, it was entertaining and well written with a tight story, and though I would have liked to see more side characters, they would be pretty useless to the plot. The parts that were supposed to be exciting were lacking because of the disorienting camera work/animation style. As for the music, it may have just been the edit I watched and it's a pretty easy fix, but it was horrible. Get on that internet, make yourself useful!","10/10"

"DHWaldron","11 August 2017","The movie truly delves into the quote of ""Ape shall not kill ape"", as we see Caesar slowly transgressing into the cloud of darkness, and abandoning all of his ambitions and love. Caesar is haunted by the memory of Koba and the quote previously mentioned, and, as the movie progresses, Caesar's love of humans dies along with his family and other apes, making him become similar to Koba. Throughout the movie, the audience soon realises that the movies are not about ""The Planet of the Apes"" anymore, but about a deeper issue of Caesar and his character's mind and thoughts. And, even Caesar seems to value his personal quests rather than the larger goal.The setting and photography are magnificent, making it hard to tell what is CGIed and what isn't. But, without the perfect visual effects, the movie would not have half the impact it had, with every single hair being done to precise measurement, you can even see the graying of Caesar's hair as he grows old and weary, with the tips tinged with white to represent the snow and ice forming on his body. Gunshots seem realistic and wrinkles on the apes give perfect contrast to the precise detail and architecture of their face. You can even notice the bags under their eyes! But, being a dedicated fan, as most who see this movie are, the tie-ins and 'nods' to the original ""Planet of the Apes"" are natural, unforced tie-ins, adding to the experience as a fan even more-so than a new customer to the ""Apes"" franchise.Easily being one of the best ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, this does not disappoint, whether you are in search of action, vendetta, emotional drama or just to the see sequel to ""Dawn"". The darkest and most tempting movie in the franchise: ""War for the Planet of the Apes"".","1/10"
"DICK STEEL","2 December 2012","Once, many thought that Life of Pi, based upon the novel by Yann Martel, was unfilmmable. But I guess it takes a special someone with much imagination and gusto to tackle it head on, dealing with three aspects many filmmakers would largely and automatically shy away from - children, animals and plenty of water - and delivering one riveting picture that's as visually arresting as it is dramatically challenging in its tale of fantasy, religion, philosophy and life.In what would essentially be a one man show for the most parts, almost akin to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks in terms of a tale on the human spirit, Ang Lee didn't have the luxury of a world renowned actor at his side delivering soliloquy after soliloquy, but had the luxury of improved technology to assist in his cause. And technology this time helped to transform this story into what it was, especially when it came to dealing with animals, having to weaken a Bengali tiger over a period of time, as well as to shoot scenes of nature and the food chain, which in normal circumstances would be almost impossible to create and control.Life of Pi is what it is, with Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi for short, with an extended little sub-arc to tell of his creation of the nickname, now an adult (Irrfan Khan), and telling his remarkable tale of shipwreck and survival in his family's uprooting from India toward Canada in search of a new life outside of the own they know of, which involved a zoo. But as it turns out, the Japanese vessel they are travelling in sank during a storm encountered while in the Miranda Trench, and the few survivors turned out to be Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and finally, one of the earth's most dangerous predators, the tiger nicknamed Richard Parker.Much of the narrative then deals with man versus animal, man versus nature and the elements, and Pi's survival while having to deal with a predator at his doorstep. In Cast Away, Tom Hanks has Wilson to interact with, while here it's a battle between Pi and Richard Parker, which one can allude or metaphors as a battle within oneself for necessities and wants, and the picking up of essential skills to survive. One took us on a slice of life trip on a deserted island, while this one takes us on a slice of life trip drifting along in the vast waters of the Pacific Ocean, amongst what would be one of the last frontiers on the planet.And this is opportunity for plenty of gorgeous, hyper imagery and visuals, that makes it a technological wet dream to deploy the kind of firepower money can buy for a movie. There's 3D technology, IMAX with its different aspect ratios that creep in during stylized sequences, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography exploiting what's best to bring about plenty of exquisitely crafted, postcard picturesque landscapes and waterscapes that will leave one astounded as these effectively augment the themes of the story, especially dealing with nature, bearing witness to both the tranquility and the ferocity that it can bring.What made it a lot admirable, is that Ang Lee decided to stick to his guns and cast a group of relative unknowns, and handing over the lead role to a new actor Suraj Sharma, who repaid the director's faith manifold. It demonstrates the leap of faith the director had to undertake, mirroring the same leap of faith Pi had in committing his survival to higher powers, doing the best with what he has at his disposal, with circumstances and outcome for someone higher up to decide. Suraj Sharma holds his own and doesn't look overawed, or too raw for a role that deals with a coming of spiritual age of sorts, and I won't be surprised if this film provides that career boost along the same lines as Dev Patel's of Slumdog Millionaire.Those who have read the book will know of a second story arc that provides the crux of most post-viewing discussion, allowing points to be made in support of, or against each version being told by Pi. What I thought interesting was how either could be truth, and it says a lot about what us humans would like to hear - only the good stuff, and that in which we can process or accept, and is more palatable for various reasons, versus something that requires a huge dose of faith and belief from the storyteller. In light of what we cannot verify, this theme turns Life of Pi into something of a religious debate, especially since Pi himself is something of a religion connoisseur, dabbling in many and yet being the master of none.Still, if that doesn't really appeal to you, then Ang Lee's story-telling craft of Yann Martel's fantasy will, of a remarkable trip across an ocean, filled with sadness, despair, yet about survival and hope, complete with stunning visuals that will keep you mesmerized for the most parts, about a boy, a tiger, and the life boat they find themselves sharing under extraordinary circumstances. A definite recommendation, and would probably be shortlisted as one of my favourites of the year!","10/10"

"diogomouraviegas","25 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning animated film that brings together multiple Spider-people from different dimensions. The film is a continuation of the first Spider-Verse movie, and it certainly delivers on the hype. From the opening scene, the film immerses its audience in a vibrant and colorful multiverse where anything is possible.The animation is one of the best things about the film. It's a mix of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated graphics, creating an eye-catching visual style that perfectly captures the comic book feel of the Spider-Man universe. The attention to detail in the animation also extends to the character design and the backgrounds, making every scene a feast for the eyes.The voice cast is also top-notch. Shameik Moore returns as Miles Morales, and Jake Johnson reprises his role as Peter B. Parker. New additions include Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Gwen, and other talented actors who bring their unique flair to their respective Spider-characters.Aside from the animation and the story, the soundtrack is another highlight of the film. The score by Daniel Pemberton is a thrilling and exciting mix of orchestral and electronic music that perfectly complements the action-packed scenes. The film also features a variety of popular songs, from Post Malone's ""Sunflower"" to Lil Nas X's ""Montero,"" adding another layer to the film's already impressive audiovisual experience.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is simply one of the best animated films ever made. It's a thrilling and action-packed adventure that delivers on all fronts, from the animation to the story, the voice acting, and the music. It's a movie that will appeal to both long-time Spider fans and newcomers to the franchise. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and swing into the Spider-Verse.","10/10"

"DJPilkington","19 March 2019","Back in 2013 when the Dragon Ball renaissance began with the release of the ""Battle of Gods"" movie, few anticipated that the franchise would continue to achieve such heights of quality half a decade later. While fans have expressed doubt during the at-times spotty run of the ""Dragon Ball Super"" anime continuation, ""Dragon Ball Super: Broly"" brings the passion and excitement to new heights and proves that the ageing shonen franchise still has steam.As the film's title flatly implies, this is very much Broly's movie. But fear not! Gone is the monosyllabic psychopath of the old Toei Anime Fair movies, replaced with a nuanced, sympathetic and well-developed reimagining of the character. While still possessing a fiery temper, this Broly is a compassionate and misunderstood figure whose isolated upbringing exiled on the inhospitable planet Vampa with only his overbearing, vengeance-crazed father Paragus for company has made him emotionally stunted and vulnerable to manipulation. Broly is effectively built up as the true protagonist of the film that we end up rooting for. In many ways, Broly reflects what Goku would be like if he had never left the forest as a kid -- Broly even gets his own quirky supporting cast in Chirai and Lemo.The animation, fight choreography and art style of the film are all perfect. Everything is so fluid, colourful and exciting to watch thanks to Shintani's new art direction, giving a fresh take on the early DBZ style. In the best possible way, it's sometimes so fast-paced that you can barely make out what's going on, but these guys are meant to be millions of times faster than the speed of light after all.""Dragon Ball Super"" mixed the high-flying power fighting of DBZ with the comedic lightheartedness of the original DB series to varying degrees of effectiveness, but ""Broly"" has the perfect mix of both. While some might scoff at the idea of Frieza being reduced to a comic relief villain, I personally find it hilarious and it makes sense seeing as how DBS's last arc had him team up with the Z-Fighters. Goku and Vegeta play surprisingly minor roles in the film, but the build-up to the canon debut of their mighty fused form, Gogeta, is epic. Both of them also get plenty of funny moments to contrast their laidback lifestyle against Broly's life of hardship.""Broly"" isn't quiiiite perfect; the introductory backstory of Paragus, Broly and Frieza's destruction of planet Vegeta is handled brilliantly for the most part, but including as well Bardock feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. It feels as though there was meant to be an additional character arc for Goku coming to terms with his Saiyan heritage that ends up feeling a little half-baked -- it would've been perfect if Goku had somehow discovered some information about his parents that causes him to question his previous notions about them. Maybe one day Toriyama will release his full 3 hour long (!!) script draft and that will shed some light. But overall, ""Broly"" is a fantastic, fantastic movie that's nostalgic enough for longtime fans and accessible enough for newcomers.","9/10"
"DJRMewzique","23 November 2012","First and foremost, I'd like to set the record straight. If you're one of those people who think ""Life of Pi"" is pretty much just a movie about a dude in a boat with a tiger, well, I have news for you......you're right.Ang Lee's latest feature, an adaptation of the book by Yann Martel which, after numerous attempts by other directors including M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Curon and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was deemed ""unfilmable,"" is indeed the story of a shipwrecked boy who survives for weeks on a lifeboat he shares with a Bengali tiger. As told to a reporter (Rafe Spall) by an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) from his Montreal home (Canada REPRESENT!), the story starts off with Pi's childhood and religious awakening before spending much time at sea...on a boat...with a big cat.Religion is the overpowering theme of the film, there is no doubt, but not in a preachy sort of way. Rather than being some sort of moralistic tale, the point I believe the narrative is trying to make is that personal spirituality is important, no matter what you may believe, and we should all just respect each other's points of view. And although I am a non-believer, that is something I cannot fault. If only, right? When a young Pi finds an interest in Christianity after having been raised Hindu and discovering the Muslim religion, his father brilliantly exclaims ""I'd rather you believe in something I do not agree with than accept all religions blindly."" Excuse me if I am paraphrasing slightly there, but the line was very powerful and one I can respect a great deal.However, despite the lovely religious equilibrium and the cute ferocious animal, ""Life of Pi"" never quite managed to enrapture me. The filming style, with its cuts and edits, came across almost amateurish and TV_movie-like while I found the script slightly underwhelming and the performances merely acceptable. Nothing more.But who am I kidding...I did not see the movie for the story. What intrigued me about the film was the talk of the visual effects. THAT is what I went for. Having been heralded as the most visually captivating film since ""Avatar,"" I was full of anticipation for this film for that reason and that reason only.And it is indeed a beautiful movie to watch on the largest screen possible. Definitely in 3D. The scenes are so incredibly drawn and meticulously brought to 3D life, you will almost forget what is going on in the film at times because you're busy staring too long at the CGI tiger going ""wow, how did they do that?"" Don't worry, it's not like you'll miss an important plot point. And you will find yourself asking that exact question many times during this film. However, it is no ""Avatar,"" which remains the most visually magnificent film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing (although I am sure many of you will see elements which have been borrowed from it at certain moments). To be honest, I didn't even find it as visually captivating as ""Cloud Atlas,"" as the beauty of the images hinder rather than help the audience personally connect with a story which seems a tad bit far-fetched as it is.No doubt Lee, a two-time Oscar nominee for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" for which he won, will undoubtedly get an invitation back to the ceremonies this year for his visual epic, but it's best chances at gold will be strictly technical, as the film itself leaves one a little underwhelmed. That time you spent the night with someone astonishingly beautiful but not terribly interesting? Yeah, kinda like that.","9/10"
"dk777","10 March 2022","The first film in this trilogy is interesting, with intriguing characters and a good story. This movie has none of that.The main villain is hilarious, as is the ending of the trilogy. The film is boring, and was supposed to be the best part of the trilogy.The scene in which The Colonel is giving a speech is so hilarious that for a moment I thought I was watching a parody. Woody Harrelson is a great actor, it's a shame the script is so bad.The script is disastrous, I was expecting a fun movie, and in the end it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've watched.The story suffers from the usual flaws of today's film production, the film is so pretentious that it's impossible to take it seriously, and worst of all, it's boring.The ending is particularly hilarious, but it fits the film, because in this film, everything is catastrophic. The title of the film is War for the Planet of the Apes, but there is no war, just a boring soap opera with CGI monkeys in the lead roles.A horrible script, a catastrophically bad story, a slow and boring film, with a hilarious ending that really looks like some kind of parody.A complete waste of time.","9/10"
"dmarvcel","29 January 2019","To clarify, I didn't watch much of Dragon Ball Super, stopping near episode 55. Even without watching the ""Tournament of Power"" arc, I could still catch onto almost everything featured in this movie. All you really need to watch in order to understand this recent Dragon Ball feature, are the movies: ""Battle of Gods"" and ""Resurrection F"".","3/10"
"dmerette","13 January 2024","OMG! You must go see this! I swear you will have so much fun. I loved every minute of it. Watching Jason Statham kick peoples a**es, its just truly amazing and done so well. I really didnt have high expectations, I thought I would see it over Mean Girls. So, I went and SO GLAD I DID! I just fell in love with the awesomeness of this totally action packed movie from the first moment to the last. I'm not saying it's perfect, but dang! It will get you pumped up and almost standing up and cheering at times. I thought all of the actors did well. The daughter was kind of a downer yawn for me most of the time. GO SEE THIS!! Total 10.","7/10"
"dmmsj0","6 May 2018","This film is disappointing, at best. Its plot is a series of battle set-pieces, in which a cast overstuffed with hero figures engage in pointless fights with an unbeatable enemy. The dialogue is throwaway, the scenes of human interaction brief and trivial, and the moral seems to be ""you can't win"". The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End. Tiresome, overwrought, and banal","10/10"
"dmoorejr","17 February 2023","Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts.","4/10"
"dmoorejr","4 June 2023","At long last we have our sequel to Into The Spiderverse. One thing I'll point out is the astonishing animation/visual effects. Truly a work of art. The way each Spiderperson had their own unique style continues to be a highlight of this franchise. It was really cool to see all the different variations of Spider-Man all in one movie. With that being said the script was a little misguided, and really failed to tell a solid story in one movie. The focus of this movie is fractured, and we as an audience are along for the ride. Definitely feels like an extended 2nd act. I've aways said a movie should be more than sequel bait, and I feel the writers stretched this story to get one more movie out of it. While it'll be an epic binge in the future, I don't see myself rewatching this one until the Spiderverse trilogy is complete.","10/10"
"dnbaeb","28 April 2019","I liked the movie, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, it was very much hyped up, but I feel like someone let the air out of my balloon while I wasn't looking.First off, love Iron Man. Was really surprised that he is one of the Avengers that is sacrificed at the end. Is he really gone? Not sure...kinda thinking he did some mastermind stuff to live on in some capacity.And then they take Cap away. An old man now...(sheesh). I do understand that Chris didn't want to play this role anymore. It's been 8 years, but hey, I could have taken a few more. And in the comics, the mantle goes to Bucky to continue as Captain America. Well right now, Bucky is just hanging out to dry (as he has been lately).And although I see that they tried to throw some humor in there, why in the world did they make Thor a drunk and fat. Really????And why did they even put Danvers in there for? OK...she found Iron Man and brought him home and then destroys Thanos' ship only. I thought she was supposed to save the day. All the hoopla with building her up in Captain Marvel (which don't get me started as to how much of that movie didn't mesh with the comics).I don't know, but the whole fighting scene was a bit much. Some things just didn't make much sense. Why is Thanos so strong all of a sudden (with no stones)?And I just don't think that certain Avengers got their fair share of screen time and some received too much.And finally, there were just holes all over the place. I'm not sure where the MCU goes from here, but I'm here for it (that's for sure).","8/10"
"dncorp","14 July 2017","So obvious that the writers Mark Bomback, Matt Reeves, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver know nothing about anything U.S. Military related.Author Pierre Boulle of 1963 La Planete des Singes, must be doing backflips in his grave.The original Planet of the Apes movies (1968, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973) were much better and closer to what the book was about.These Remakes (to cater to the Millennials (ages 18 to 39)) are just as disappointing as Tim Burton's Failed 2001 Remake, Planet of the Apes.War, what War?, more like a small skirmish.(Spoiler) At the Opening Scenes U.S. Military do NOT bunch up and get close together as one handgrenade, RPG, landmine will kill many. U.S. Military use Night Vision Devices to obtain a significant advantage, instead of rifle mounted flashlights with visible laser aiming devices.(Spoiler) U.S. Military do not choose places that give the Enemy ANY Tactical Advantages (at the bottom of a valley surrounded by mountains, low locations, places that can be flooded, flat terrain). They would never have been at a location subject to rock slides, nor avalanches.(Spoiler) Standard Operating Procedure U.S. Military do NOT Charge into Enemy Machineguns like World War 1, World War 2, Korean War. Current idea is to use Airstrikes, Cruise Missile Attacks, ""Drone"" Strikes, Field Artillery, Mortars, Grenade Launchers from a distance (out of Enemy Weapons Range) to completely eliminate the Enemy. Using these Fires the Enemy is trapped like in a trash compacter, with the Fires behind, to the flanks of the Enemy, with the Fires behind the Enemy preventing Resupply or Reinforcements (Ape Cavalry would have become horse meat dog food), the Fires behind the Enemy moves closer forcing the Enemy to leave their Defensive Positions and attack U.S. Military Machinegun fortifications and defensive positions, result the Enemy gets slaughtered.Humans have had Thousands of Years to develop the Art of War, the Apes nothing, yet the Movie Writers make the Apes appear to have Graduate from U.S. Military War College.Woody Harrelson, needs to go back to doing what he did best, that innocent ignorant Cheers Employee, not a Colonel, U.S. Military routinely does Psychological Exams, Woody Harrelson would have never made it from O-1 (Second Lieutenant) to O-2 (First Lieutenant) with all the blunders he made.The Authors need to stop using the successful Anti War movie Apocalypse Now 1979 as a template, and get creative with their own ideas. Watching this was like watching a Political Correct (script written by PETA, as Humans Bad, Animals Good) G Rated version of R Rated Apocalypse Now.","10/10"
"DocteurDream","30 January 2024","Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo.","5/10"
"DoctorDragon","11 July 2020","(Before starting reading remember: this is MY opinion and how I felt by watching this movie. If you didn't enjoy it...I am sorry for you.)I will never be so hyped again for a movie in general. This is the perfect conclusion for a 10 years old saga. It closes the arches of the main characters and opens some for the new ones. The battle scenes are awesome, the themes too, perfect character narration and development. Maybe the plot is a little bit simple and predictable, but sometimes you don't need a complex one to do a perfect movie. You can't judge a movie only by one aspect of itself. Infinity war was the ACTION part, endgame was the FEELINGS part.
Yes, infinity war was better, but this movie also has its moments.One of the best experiences I had in a theater, we cried, we laughed, we smiled. almost PERFECTION.","10/10"
"Dominic_25_","6 June 2023","I don't remember how long it has been since I've seen the first one but I am pretty sure I liked it better than this one. This is both a sequel and an unfinished story which negatively impacts my interpretations.First of all this film is once again really well done, visually. They went from the interesting art style of the first one to expanding and giving the other universes unique styles. It is so well done and so pretty and I only rarely got overwhelmed with the visuals. I can think of only once. This is a really great film to look at. The filmmakers did such an amazing job.The story is incomplete but pretty well done. I would rather have seen a 6 hour film than a part one. I like how they expanded the characters from the first film and explored more of the multiverse. I am not a huge fan of references to the MCU but the short references to the other live action Spider-Man films are less annoying. Also I only get like half of the references to the comics because I have never read a single Spider-Man comic book. But that's fine I'm not really interested in fan service, if I knew more I might just have been more annoyed. So I loved it and I loved seeing so many different versions of this character. Hobie is my favorite character, once I got used to his accent I realized he has amazing politics. I loved everything he did in this film and I wanted to see more of him but I'm guessing we'll get more of him in part 2.Being a film so heavily interconnected to comics, I feel like they decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to end it on a cliffhanger but they were wrong. The MCU does this thing where they don't have their films be self-contained stories and so they are fine with leaving threads open and teasing future installments. All very similar to actual comic books which are famous for their cliffhangers. Unfortunately, this is a film and I treat them as such because I like films more than comics. If they wanted to tell a grand story then make it a longer movie, I can handle it. Whether they did it because they wanted a second release date for more money, or they did it because of the logistics of having a 3-hour plus movie, I think it was a bad idea. If I wanted an incomplete story that ends on a cliffhanger then I'd read a comic or watch a show.I do think this film justifies it's own existence and I'm glad it was made. I think this story was interesting enough to carry a 6 hour runtime so it could have finished the story. I didn't mind 2.5 hours because it was such a fun story and the visuals were fantastic. Once the second part comes out I'll probably pretend this was just one long movie.","10/10"
"dominic-30989","21 July 2023","Stunning visualsExtremley funnyGreat plotGreat charactersCan't wait for the next one!Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Absolutely no screen time wasted, the movie did not drag for a second. The characters are some of the best ever. The voice acting is perfect to say the least. Every frame of this 2 hour movie is a beautifully crafted piece of art.

"dominoder","9 July 2023","I remember going to the cinema to see Raiders of the lost Ark when I was 16 and it became my all time favourite movie & I have loved every single movie in this franchise since.The latest offering is no exception, it's got what you want from an old fashioned movie, action, adventure, great villain, reasonable plot, humour & Harrison Ford.I'm not sure why some of reviews dislike this film, maybe they just want to see it fail?! But if you are a true fan of the series then you're going to love it.Harrison Ford loves this character and it shows,who cares what age he is he still plays Indy brilliantly. There's plenty of fan service in the film, I only wish is that a certain lady had more screen time.Also the score from John Williams is spot on!!If you want a fun family action adventure go and see it!!","8/10"
"don-damon","3 February 2024","Oh yeah, Jason is killing them again on the big screen. 'bout time! His last couple of films were okay, but nothing like this one. Kind of like John Wick series. I would love to see a sequel to this one, like he did for ""The Mechanic"". Other actors in this film, ehhh! Not so great. Agent Verona Parker maybe could have done without her. Didn't add much to the plot. The whole story line is a bit exaggerated with the POTUS being involved in the son's illicit gains. Don't think that was too smart of role selection. Would have rather seen a very high up CIA director involved in the scam, since they were using the software this scum was buying. Overall lots of action and lots of killing. I enjoyed the whole thing.","7/10"
"don-giovanni-forever","12 May 2018","Lets keep it real, the movie was overhyped by Marvel fanbois. And if we're being honest this movie actually deserves a 6 or 7 rating. It started weird, and as someone pointed out already the Order didnt get an introduction, and theres no need since theyre all dead. Escaping Asgard when Hella destroyed it was pointless since they're all dead as far as we know, unless Loki used some magic to hide them.. but going back to the beginning of the movie.... we dont know. It was a pile of shi and we need to stop rewarding crap with praise. Im sure part 2 will be better but very overhyped by fanbois, the weakest link in the chain","1/10"
"donmurray29","12 January 2024","Giving this an 8/10 ratingDavid Ayer has been quiet on the film making front, but he is back, with this superb guilty pleasure action film. Writer Kurt Wimmer teams up with Jason Statham again, but this time the result is much better.There is much fighting, lots of great humour and yes there is a story, which is brought really to light by a much beer than I expected script, and some proper good acting, and the direction and pace is sedate in the right places, then bursts of action when it's needed.Jeremy Irons is very super cool and elegant all the way though, Jason Statham is totally driven as the beekeeper, and you learn a lot about bees along the way, Emmy Raver-Lampman is focused and also driven, Bobby Naderi is the suffering partner who is very sarcastic, but most of all, Josh Hutcherson, who was last seen in 'Five Nights at Freddie's' has fun with his role switch, his character is dislikable and we all have meet people in real like like him, he's superb too.This is more like 'Nobody', that stared Bob Odenkirk, not 'John Wick', which I have been reading companions too. This movie is action fun.","8/10"
"donnodcassandra-41099","21 February 2021","OK I liked the movie , it was the first movie with someone die for no reason that I liked ( no reason meaning it could be an other way , much easier way) the past Avengers movies was like "" Nah! well ok"" Cause you know the whole ""EVERYONE WILL DIE "" was a little bit not so ok . Second thing if Wanda just did what she did in the mini series everyone would be fine! I am not gonna say what she did for the spoilers, but nooo they wanted someone to die and of course it wasn't Spiderman which I realy hate ( He is annoying) it was Iron man , my favourite heroe , thank you Marvel for destroying my childhood . Everyone is like "" He is a hero , he saved everyone "" Nooo its not like that , Wanda could be the hero without dying!!! Or Captain Marvel to absolve all the jem power out of the glove BUT NOO someone had to die right? But if we don't see that part the rest of the movie was AWSOME!!!!","9/10"

There were Multiple People Laughing throughout the Audience, so the Fun Factor was Definitely There.🐝/ 🌍 I Mean the Core Concept of the World of Bees that is used as a Juxtaposition against Humanity and It's Upper Echelon of Constructs was a Great Idea.Let's do the Positives First -1. 😠Or🎉Or🤡. The Tone of the Film. I Love this Tone . It's Basically Jason Statham is Dead Serious(Every Time he is around FBI, Security Guards or the Scam Workers it's Funny because he plays it Dead Seriously and Everything Around him is Pretty Much a Joke😂🤣), with Everyone Else Being 1 of 5 Things -1a. 🃏 Characters are either Flamboyant Caricatures (Hosts of the Scam, Australian Guy and his Crew and The Pink Jacket Beekeeper)
1b. 🎉 Or Have this Comedic/Jovial Tone About them (Workers of the Scam in this Corporate Building, The FBI couple, one of them whose Mother Just Died by the Way 🤦🏻😂)
1c. Or Cannon Fodder(Seals, Delta Force, Heavily Armed FBI Guys)
1d. 😠 Or Serious (2nd in command of FBI, The President)
1e. 💆 Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are doing some sort of Whimsical/Serious at Times Tone.2. 📜.....I think the Opening Works, and Many of the Ideas of the Film are Great. But where are the Thawing out and Details of Pretty much everything in this Film?3. 💣 The Action Scenes. Some of the Action Scenes were Ok and Others Were Great. Particularly -3a. FBI outside the Building Scene.3b. The Elevator Scene.3c. 🃏 The Pink Jacket Beekeeper Scene. (LOL it was just outta nowhere and Ridiculous yet Entertaining)3d. 🔪 The One on One Fight Scene near the End. WHAT A SCENE! IT GOT PRETTY INTENSE. Multiple Oooooossss from the Audience I was with.On to the Negatives -1a. 📜 Did they Rush the Script or Something? Again the Core Concept of the Bees ""Keeping Things in Check"" is a Great idea. Where's the Fleshing out of this and Everything Else?1b. 🐝 So the Beekeepers are So Deadly Right? So Deadly, that the Beekeepers make the Delta Force and the Navy Seals look like Wimps right? So why does Jason Statham Dispatch of a Flamboyantly Dressed Eccentric Beekeeper 🐝 with Not Too Much Effort? I mean, she didn't last that long, at all. Some of the Navy Seals put up more of a Fight than her(Not really, but you get what I mean)1c. 🐝 The Queen Bee Concept. So when the Queen Bee becomes Less Productive or Sick, the Worker Bees Kill her right? So why did the Filmakers Abandon this right at the Very end when Jason Statham is Staring at the Queen? Hello! He's called the Beekeeper and he doesn't even Follow through on the Concept? Ok so the Writers had no Balls to pull off the Kill? What about the Writers at Least Playing on this Angle At the Very End far more? Have Jason Statham take hold of that Revolver and having the Son and Queen There Playing Russian Roulette with the Revolver or Something. But I get that they decided to go with ""Well, the Beekeeper Killed the Defective Offspring"" I guess.1d. 🐝 You're Telling me that the Queen Bee didn't know where all that Money 💰 was Coming from?🤷 Neutral Note - Why is Jason Statham Actually Handling Bees? Is this part of the Beekeeper Training Regiment? Or Just a Schtick that's part of the Film? Ok that's fine, I have no Real Problem with that.Overall, with all that Said LOL. Was I Entertained?........Yes, I was.","8/10"
"dor-41511","30 December 2018","Awesome film about this new movie about this year's event.","9/10"
"dorMancyx","20 February 2023","""Phase Five"", ""Kang the conqueror"", ""multiverse"" --- it all sounds so monumental, but looks so tottering.Great visual effect (shout out to the VFX workers), as illustrated in a motley of scenic, architectural, and environmental designs; especially the long shot of the flight sequence, which captures the flamboyant otherworldliness of quantum realm. Action wise, the movie presents a short yet meticulous combat scene between Kang and the Ant-family, displaying tacit combos and fluent choreography. Moreover, giant Ant-Man demolishing the citadels is quite similar to AOT, and the way Kang suspends the hurtling cane gives me Kylo Ren vibes, not to mention the quantum species are really comparable to the aliens of Star Wars, which are all nice little allusions in my opinion but could be a sign of Marvel's creativity fatigue. And here goes the negatives.I'm sorry, but Cassie's actress is terrible at portraying her character, showing no emotions facially or within the eyes when her father falls off a cliff or gets beaten to death by the villain, which contrasts farcically to her anxious voice. Introducing terrible ""New Avengers"" is hereditary as we've seen in Phase Four (Iron Heart, Kate Bishop, America), which is why Stinger is even more frustrating and illogical of a character: unreasonably caring, doted by her family, and excuse me incited a local rebellion as a two-day visitor? Speaking of which, the rebels demonstrate so potent a motive with so little characterization, as they seem even less important to the plot development that actual ants. And speaking of ants, how in the flabbergasted-ness do ants overpower the timeline-shattering Thor-killing multiverse-conquering Kang? I understand how Jonathan Majors is grinding to perform this so-called ""ultimate antagonist"" of Phase Five and Six with contorted facial expressions and balefully imperious tone, yet Kang's failure in the film simply makes this villain far less menacing. Though titled ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", the movie leaves no room for Scott (I'm sorry Paul you tried) or Hope (basically Black Widow but only the stingers) to literally and figuratively ""grow"" as main characters. Michelle and Michael's chemistry is the only landing ground for comedy (oh yeah the jokes suck btw); though in terms of between-character scenes, I loved the backstory of Janet and Kang, as their brief interaction exhibits a mother's yearning and a warrior's sympathy with pure dialogues and micro-expressions, which in turn deepens the duo's contradiction.If this was a film of Phase Four, I'd let it slide with a 7/10. However, we're in a new Phase with new expectations, and the customers will not be satiated with Marvel serving the same meal as before.","6/10"
"dpg-87522","24 September 2019","When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is ""good"", but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general. Yes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War ""struggled"" to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how did that rat could get in? The time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend. Something that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish. If you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos. To tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad. But well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head. And as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons. Pros: -Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself. -They managed to complete their goal. Cons: -To condemn humanity. -Leave his wife a widow. -Let your daughter an orphan. - Wreck the work of a visionary. -Kill oneself. But the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman. So and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not? Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me. In conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less.","7/10"
"Dr_Mark_ODoherty","5 February 2024","The plot: A former operative of a powerful and clandestine organization known as ""Beekeepers"", cleans up in America, restoring Liberty and Social Justice in the Global Community.Being a 'Beekeeper' myself, I'm politely informing the Iranian dictatorship - namely Ali Khamenei and the IRGC - that they have a moral and legal obligation to restore the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in Iran. Otherwise we will bring them to Justice; and take over the country until the UDHR has been manifested.The same applies to Israel, namely the oppressive Netanyahu regime; Netanyahu being responsible for the incitement that led to PM Yitzhak Rabin's 1995 assassination and sabotaging Peace Talks. Hence the Israeli government must end apartheid and the occupation of Palestine - by implementing Equality, International Law and Universal Suffrage.NB: Just like 2,500 years ago - during the Iron Age - tyrants, fanatics and evildoers still clobber each other over the head, aiming to exert dominance and slavery over each other; in particular guys like Ali Khamenei, Netanyahu and the mad Putin regime, which is very disappointing. Hence we must finally all work together to manifest World Peace and the UDHR.But no worries, if all else fails, I'll take over these countries - as the current President of the Middle East, UK, Russia and United States.Love and Light / Peace Profound.Mark - BTB-Global Peacebuilding / UNITED NATIONS - POTUS - THE CROWN/RUSSIA - PRESIDENT OF THE MIDDLE EAST - EU/UK/AU - ICC/ICJ.PS: Due to a dramatic increase in neo-nazi activity in today's Germany and Austria, we also order a crackdown on Germany's and Austria's far-right - including all neo-nazis who support the illegal war in Ukraine.

"drael64","22 July 2017","In an age where everything human is neutered through the lense of political correctness, the apes series represents a bold, primal honesty, where neither humans nor apes are good nor bad and everything is on display, and not hidden in pretence. Its an exploration of morality, and the war between that and the primal emotions of hate, sadness, and fear that broil inside us, brilliantly brought to life by the animal-human hybrid of emotions acted through our protagonists the apes. In this movie we follow caeser and his tribe, in a quest for revenge, rescue and to avoid a war.This plot is not specifically about ""a war"", but rather a battle in the context of a greater war - so while there is action, like the other ape movies there is a lot more going on than just boringly consistent bang, boom, woosh. In particular there are dramatic moments, that speak to the human condition, and the inner battles we face in life.This movie brings a very welcome touch of comic relief which lightens the mood to the series, and also a little innocent love and hope - so you won't walk away feeling jaded either. Moving, exciting, and brilliantly executed.","1/10"
"drain-457-831790","30 August 2013","Often during watching LoP I felt the overall frame was pleasing, yet the digital work on this is amazing to a fault. The digital imagery, I felt, often took the focus off the story/characters ...If you've ever had Mormon's show up at your doorstep, you are familiar with the preachy/sales-vibe this movie puts off.The acting was poor (main actor's Indian accent is no dialect I have ever heard), the story was ho-hum and the mumble-core scenes between old Pi and the author is probably a top naturopath alternative to ambien.I went in to this movie expecting to not like it (not a fan of feel good, triumph of spirit style movies), but I was surprised by feeling real anger at having watched this ostentatious drivel.Literally was Disney + L Ron Hubbard","7/10"

I know some people may not agree but I think the Broly story is a tired one. I would, at the very least like to see a refreshing story about Broly. He is a great character with so much potential, please write something new and captivating!
Now, the fight scenes! Just horrible & lazy! No combat structure to the choreography, just excessive zooming in and out, characters charging and posing with distracting lighting effects... and far too many zooms into screaming mouths!!!
There was no progression in the fight scenes! Just blow for blow.
What hope do we have for quality anime if people keep slapping on 10/10 for productions like this... Appalling!","10/10"
"droideka75","19 March 2023","So where to begin... Premise is good, they go to quantum realm, they have an adventure they get back. Quantum realm should have been only half the movie, other half should have been how to get there. No, it's a CGI world with a villain that did nothing but be a joke. That's ridiculous MODOK. He looks ridiculous but he could be at least menacing. And turning ridiculous into something great has always been Marvel strength. Just look at Arnim Zola. He's basically a giant robot with a teletubby tv face in the comics. Pretty menacing in winter soldier. But no they couldn't/wouldn't figure out a way to adapt him, so he's just kind of there. Mostly comic accurate (not even that he's supposed to be body horror deformed) physically but the rest? He's just kinda there for laughs. Laughs that don't come.Fine, but the heros go on a journey right? No! They merely travel. They see wonderous things and what do they end up? Same as they were before. There's no character progression for any of the main cast except maybe Janet! Hope has literally nothing to do the entire movie. Scott and Cassie have a tiny argument about Scott being a hero and having to help. All good by the end, no lessons learned, nothing. Status quo is reset. And the inhabitants are portrayed as inept if they need 4 shrinking heroes that mainly give out a small uninspired speech to motivate them. That's literally it. The heroes do nothing of substance that the inhabitants couldn't do on their own. And such a waste of talent... Even bill Murray feels flat, Wich I thought impossible, but here we are.CGI was shady, some good parts, but mostly boring green screen stuff, or volume. There's even a shot where Cassie and Scott embrace while giant that has nothing to compare them to like a building or something recognizable, so they look like regular size just slightly slower. Got my biggest laugh, but I'm sure it wasn't supposed to be funny, didn't work either way.Some of the character designs are good, the hole guy, the lamp guy, but again they have barely anything to do.The only true quality in the movie is Jonathan Majors as Kang. It literally saved the movie. I can't stress this enough he's phenomenal! And I hope Marvel puts him in much better projects cause he nailed it! Can't wait to see more of him.I'm inclined to think a lot of the blame falls on the writer, that didn't know/care about these characters. It's just poorly poorly written. And KF that approved this.Trend continues for Marvel unfortunately. They try so hard to be funny, they fail. Laughs came easy when they weren't actively ridiculing themselves. They need to take themselves serious and sprinkle some jokes not make a mockery of the source material and frankly of the fans. If the writers don't have respect for the comics, this is what happens. Thor 4 and Quantumania. I thought mom and eternals had issues but at least they took themselves serious. This? This an insult.I give it a 6 mainly for Kang or this would be a miserable 5.","7/10"
"dromasca","28 July 2017","'Planet of the Apes' generated by now enough big screen and TV series film to be considered a genre or at least a sub-genre by itself. While the original series was playing more in the post-apocalyptic stories space with the original movie one of the strong head of series creation, the more recent remake started as a sci-fi thriller. The second and now third film in the series see the two themes converge as enough bad things happened on Planet Earth for mankind to become again endangered species. Actually both apes and humans seem to be endangered in this latest War for the Planet of the Apes and the two species are caught in a deadly war that may prove to be fatal to both.The premises of the story are similar with the majority of the other films in the series. Humans have made enough fatal mistakes and their psychological, biological, but especially character problems make of them inferior (on the moral if not also on the intelligence scales) to the apes. On the ruins of what was once our civilizations gangs of human survivors and herds of ape survivors fight for their own existence and between them. It's not a modern war, it's more like tribal fights. Which is no less cruel or spectacular in cinematographic terms.When this new series started and I saw the first film (I think that I missed the second) I appreciated the technical performance of making of each one of the apes a character of its own using computer graphics enhancement, but the story seemed thin and conventional. This third film has the same problems, actually it got worse. Visuals are impressing but the story got not only conventional but full of clichés. It's a deja-vu post-apocalyptic story with religious and moralistic tones, and having it spoken 80% of the time by apes does not make it smarter. Some of the choices of director Matt Reeves also seemed to me uninspired. Some of the apes talk a sign language, other a primitive form of the language of the enemy (English, of course). Arms are an odd mix of modern weaponry, tribal bow and arrows and beginning of the 20th century guns. Female apes are wearing ear-rings. etc. It's difficult to talk too much about acting, as playing the human model for the apes computer image requires special skills - I assume they are OK as the effect is fine, but it's not a novelty any longer and the film relies too much on those. So I assume Andy Serkis is a fine actor but I need to see more of him, while Woody Harrelson does what we expect from him in the human bad guy role.The ending of the original 'Planet of the Apes' was mind-blowing, one of the most memorable final scenes in the history of cinema. What we have in 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is so far from that. The action twist and the meaningful reflection on the future of mankind that were turning the original into a great movie was replaced by a so expected and conventional image with moralistic and religious pretensions. This says almost all about the failure of this film. Faithful fans (and I am among them) will go and see this film. Many will be disappointed, as it is heavy and full of stuff that we have already seen so many times. Good cinematography and special effects are also repetitive and cannot save it. One of the characters is called Bad Ape and repeats his name many times in the movie. He may have said 'Bad Planet' as well.","8/10"

"DrTuvok","14 April 2020","Watching this movie I couldn't help but wonder what would happen to the apes if their horses suddenly got the idea to overthrow their authority; because having two full sized apes riding one horse is more animal abuse than Michael Cimino could dig up in the entire filming of Heaven's Gate.If I couldn't help thinking about these ridiculous things, it was because so little was happening story-wise for nearly the entire movie. It began as a standard revenge story, which, if done rightly, can still be engaging, but the problem director Matt Reeves has here is that he decided to make the main character, Caesar, a model ape who never leaves his bubble of innate goodness. There is no moral dilemma which most revenge stories at least dabble in. Instead Reeves manages to stretch this plod out for over two hours, stuffing it full of overwrought emotions, unbearably slow ape dialogs, and hazy philosophical nonsense. The second movie in this trilogy (the only watchable thing Matt Reeves has directed so far) was far more interesting for depicting a struggle where neither side was really right, but this one just paints an 'all apes are good, all humans are bad' picture. I don't have a problem with good versus evil stories, but since I have a hard time seeing all human beings as inherently evil, it doesn't really work. What happened to the Charlton Heston movie where the apes were seen cruelly hunting humans down as vermin? No one knows. What happened to the satiric edge these movies used to have that even Tim Burton's maligned remake held on to? No one knows. Why is this movie taking itself so seriously when it's about CG apes taking over the world? Who knows. Why are the humans surrounded by religious imagery? Because Matt Reeves apparently likes to fantasize about eradicating religions he doesn't like. Where's the war? We get a couple of small-scale fight scenes, but that's all.And the national anthem scene was beyond stupid. I guess Reeves thought he was really clever in equating monkeys with abused indigenous people or whatever he was trying to do, but it was just disgusting. Besides, the USA is insulted left and right all the time by Hollywood. If Reeves really wanted to be really edgy maybe he should have attacked Communist China, a country which only gets pandered to...Many of the positive reviews on this site are attacking those criticizing this movie as uneducated rubes who know nothing about film. Therefore I think I need to clear myself. If you want an action movie, watch John Woo's the Killer or Hard Boiled. If you want action merged with story, watch Mel Gibson's Braveheart, Apocalypto, or Hacksaw Ridge. If you want a psychological thriller, watch Frankenheimer's Manchurian Candidate, Seconds, or any of Hitchcock's films. (Strangers on a Train is my personal favorite). If you want a biblical movie, watch the Charlton Heston Ben-Hur, the Robe, or Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. If you
Want to see expert cinematography and lighting, see Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. If you want an epic or a war film, try the David Leans, the LOTR trilogy, Kurosawa's Ran, Kubrick's Paths of Glory, Patton, or even the Last Samurai. If you want something newer, try Ridley Scott's the Martian, anything by Chris Nolan, or the Mission Impossible series. If you want a revenge story, you could watch Tarantino, or even better, read the Count of Monte Cristo, probably the best revenge story I've come across. There are so many other things better than this movie, and this one is too pretentious to even be a guilty pleasure.","4/10"

"dsa_ca","9 December 2012","I love coming of age movies. They have been my go to movies for over a decade. A real world experience that molds a person's character for rest of his/her life is a universal subject that would never dry up. But then there is this book called 'Life of Pi' that I came across and provided more than my staple coming of age diet and take me through a journey of faith and beliefs. This book acts as a disguise to be spiritual (given that is set in India), but at the core is a coming of age story of a boy finding answers of faith and beyond having born in a nation of millions of gods. And to turn this book into a captivating movie, we have Mr. Ang Lee; who clearly love challenges.Set in India and made by Hollywood studio; you should expect the simplistic description of a very complex nation and its affair with religions of the world. But Mr. Lee manages to breeze through the shallow storyline based in India. Almost all of the situations and scenarios about young boy Pi's life in Pondicherry, India are created to suit the taste buds of western audiences. As we watch the young Pi grow in dreamy India along with a soulfully spoken narrative by Irfan Khan in background; we instantly are lost in the color and the mood of the film. We never look beyond those colors into reality and we are ready to accept anything. But as we move on from Anglo India into open sea; faith and personal beliefs of Pi collides with nature's fury. After Pi Patel's father, a zoo owner decides to move his family in Canada and sell the animals to a North American zoo for a good prize; they begin their journey. The entire family along with all the animals travels through a Japanese cargo ship across the oceans. There they have encounter with a borderline racist French cook and a very gentle Buddhist. There reel time is only for one sequence, but there presence and importance will be felt late in the movie. As the journey of the ship abruptly ends in a very violent ocean; Pi is survived on a life boat with an injured zebra, an Orangutan, a Hyena and a Bengal Tiger. And from here on the journey could not be more breath taking and satisfying. It literally and astonishingly unbelievable with Pi surviving on a life boat with these animals and they are animals. They will do anything to survive like humans. The mystery of the journey and whether you believe in the memories of the adult Pi about his experiences across the vast ocean will make you rethink about all the mystical fantasies that we have ever came across.The story already hooks the audience into the ongoing proceedings and Mr. Lee's breathtaking visuals puts 'Avatar' in its place & carries you through a journey of vast beauty across our planet. After Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, Mr. Lee successfully trumps those monumental achievements in Cinema history with this visual masterpiece that deserves compulsory 3D viewing.For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/","7/10"
"dschlatter","18 May 2023","I was sceptical, when the first Ant-Man came out. But man, did that movie entertain. Paul Rudd's charm and the supporting cast carried a (let's be honest) fairly riddiculous premise and made it work.So imagine my joy when part two was just as good. But then, Marvel had to weave movies together and every movie had to be part if some bigger scheme. I like standalone movies that just tell a good story. I don't appreciate that a villain is ""introduced"" so he can re-appear in some other franchise. And enough with the bloody multiverse. What a drag. Dr. Strange, Loki, Ant-Man, Spiderman..,
Ant-Man worked in the real world, much like Spiderman used to work. 90% blue screen does not do the characters or the movie any favors. It's just a boring mess of flashy images and lights.Take it down a notch, Marvel. You are losing that speacial ingredient that made for great movies. Don't make me switch to DC, please.","7/10"
"dschlatter","5 February 2024","Most Statham movies ""suffer"" from the same problem. The action is just too macho for my taste. My 14-year old self would have adored it. At 42 I still cheer, when good guys rough up bad guys. But The Beekeeper faces dozens of trained men head-on, no weapon in hand. (As if they were just regular people from the street,) And two characters were way over the top. The female Beekeeper was comically over the top. As was the blond merc towards the end.The fight scenes and the action, however are beautifully done. The whole movie is beautiful.A bit of modesty here and there, would have scored a 9/10.The last point deduction would be the yuppie villains that are also a bit cartoonish in their behavior (except Jeremy Irons).Still waiting for that one perfect Statham movie.","7/10"
"dschlatter","6 May 2019","The soon-to-be most successful movie of all times actually ranks fairly low among its companions. I'd say it is about as good as Winter Soldier.
As a fan of the pevious films, expecially Infinity War, I couldn't miss this one. I think that goes for most movie-goers. After Infinity War, we HAD to see how it ends. Infinity War was an almost perfect movie.
And now we get less than perfect. Now, we get ""good"" or ""very good"" and in comparison it seems almost bad.
My issue is not how the film is made. But with the story they chose to tell:
1. Thanos can't be the stronger villain without his gauntlet. That's poor writing.
2. Captain Marvel and Captain America are NOT equally strong (when fighting Thanos).
3. Stormbreaker was this amazing weapon in Infinity War. It beat Thanos with all stones in his gauntlet. Now it's just as steong as the hammer.
4. Thor has just found his purpose and strength in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Now he is a joke.
5. The time travel is, well, how itz always is. Hardly logical.
Those are the issues that now trouble me after having seen it two days ago. It just wasn't as good as Infinity War. They missed their mark.","7/10"
"dtucker86","30 June 2023","Who would have ever guessed when the first Raiders was released 42 summers ago that a movie about a man with a bullwhip and fedora named ""Indiana Jones"" would become a blockbuster hit spawning one of the most beloved and longest running franchises in cinema history. I was in junior high when Raiders came out and am now just seven years away from being eligible for Social Security. I wanted to mention a bit of trivia. Back in 1989 when Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade came out Sean Connery was cast as his father and played him as a doddering helpless old man, Connery was only 59 at the time and Harrison Ford did this movie when he was 80 years old an amazing accomplishment by any standards.There has been so much written about the prologue to the film set during the waning days of World War II as Indiana Jones and his friend Basil infiltrate a Nazi train to try to get Archimedes ""dial of destiny"" that can allow one to travel through time. In those twenty minutes there is enough action for several movies and the CGI ""deaging"" is very effective. After the dynamite beginning the movie moves forward over twenty years in time. It is now 1969 and those years certainly haven't been kind to Jones. In the original he was a dashing professor/adventurer a combination of Clark Kent and Superman. Now he is an old broken man, the old grouch next door yelling at his neighbors to turn their music down while seasoning his coffee with whiskey as he mourns the breakup of his marriage and the death of his son in Vietnam (oh well ""Mutt"" was a pretty loathsome contemptable character that almost no one liked anyway and Shia Lebouef is a terrible actor). His students now doze through his lectures, after all who wants to hear about archeology in the age where men are landing on the moon. His colleagues throw him a retirement party where he is ushered out the door with his only reward being a cheap clock he gives to a homeless person.Poor Indiana Jones is past his ""sell by"" date and has become an anachronistic bore. This is technically a good and exciting movie but the original was shoulders above and not nearly as depressing. The writers of this film lean very heavily on the nostalgia factor rather then trying to be original for example we have Indy having a reunion with his old pal Salla who mourns the good old days of adventure they once shared only for Indy to say they are gone forever. Ford does get a chance to ""act"" more then in the other films especially the scene where he shares his grief over his son's death and his regrets of a somewhat misbegotten life in pursuit of treasures while not appreciating what really matters. There is a humerous reference to his fear of snakes of course (only in this case it involves giant eels that just look like snakes).Madds MIkkelsen is a fine actor who has the distinction now of playing Doctor Hannibal Lecter on the tv series, a villain in a Bond film and now a villain in an Indiana Jones films my what a distinction! He gives a great performance and reminds me a little of the Nazi Toht the character that Ronald Lacey played in the original Raiders. There is also a nod in the movie to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom featuring a street kid who reminds you of Short Round, only he is not likeable at all just a little punk who annoyed the hell out of me. English character actor Basil Jones does a delightfully hammy turn as Indy's sidekick during the opening.This is the first Indy movie where Spielberg is not in the director's chair but James Mangold does a good job filling his shoes. Mangold is actually an acclaimed director in his own right his most famous film was I Walk The Line About Johnny Cash. He also directed Stallone in Cop Land and Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day. He handles the action scenes with expert aplomb such as the horse and the subway scene.Phoebe Waller Bridge does a commendable job as Jones goddaughter and his companion on the adventure. My only complaint is she is somewhat of a immoral schemer and not very likeable. Many have commented about the ending of the movie being ridiculous as the Dial of Destiny malfunctions and sends Indy and the others back to 213 BC during the Siege of Rome. Oh well at least he got to meet his hero Archimedes. By the way, the whole audience in the theatre laughed when Bridge delivered that ""punch of love"" so Indy could go back to the present.The final part of the movie is the most touchng featuring a cameo by Karen Allen (a great actress who has never been given the credit she deserves) as Marion and Indy reunite and it seems there is hope for their future as in the twilight of their years they recreate a scene from the original that really warmed my nostalgic heart. For some reason the film closes on a bizarre closeup of Indy's hat! Its been a helluva ride Indiana Jones enjoy your afternoon naps and your golden years and may your demons be at rest.","6/10"
"DubhDoo","9 March 2013","In a manner somewhat similar to the recent adaptation of David Mitchell's 'Cloud Atlas', 'Life of Pi' shouldn't work. Based on the award-winning and widely-lauded 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel, it chronicles the life-changing maritime adventure of a young Indian boy humorously named Piscine or ""Pi"" for short, who after a surviving the sinking of a ship, ends up on a lifeboat, with a hyena, an orang-utan, a zebra and of course, a large Bengal tiger called Richard Parker (a moniker that came about wittily). Consequently, the book came to considered 'unfilmmable' (and for just cause), yet the world of cinema's interest in Martel's wonderful novel remained undying and after much development the proposed adaptation eventually landed at the feet of the excellent Ang Lee. Despite Lee's having proved himself to be a director of considerable talent, with superb offerings like 'The Ice Storm' and 'Brokeback Storm', themselves both adaptations, it was doubtful whether or not the much-loved novel would translate successfully to the big screen. Many other accomplished directors have failed to capture similarly ambitious novels in film form, such as David Lynch's folly that was 'Dune'. Any worry has turned out to be unnecessary though as the Taiwanese filmmaker has delivered a beautiful and moving film that is easily one of his finest works yet. There's no denying that 'Life of Pi' is filled with visual beauty, as in teaming up with DoP Claudio Miranda, Lee has utilised the film's ocean setting like an impressionistic artist to a blank canvas. Even though it is a scene that has done the rounds in the film's trailers, the night- set scene where the whale leaps out of the water is a thing of breathtaking majesty. Similarly, there are numerous moments that are nothing short of gorgeous in a way that could see even Terrence Malick become envious. Adding to this, the use of CGI is one of the most remarkable in recent years, exemplified with the meticulous detail put into Richard Parker, which renders him a significant achievement in CGI, as it becomes rather difficult to tell when the tiger is real or not.Yet, it's worth noting that this is a film that resonates on an emotional level as well as a technical. From the moment proceedings kicked off, I was engrossed in Pi's story, with its smooth fluidity, whether I was looking at Irrfan Khan or Suraj Sharma. The latter, a first time actor, delivers a great and at times subtle performance as the titular character, consistently helping me to engage with Pi and ultimately, like him. Even as he was simply sitting upon a raft in silence, I still couldn't help but find myself enthralled in the journey he had (unwillingly) embarked on.'Life of Pi' is a wonderful film, bursting with imagination and in love with the possibilities of storytelling, which sees Ang Lee wield 3-D expertly, forgoing the usual gimmicky 'things leaping out of the screen' and instead adding more depth and texture to the colourful cinematography. It's not just a technical marvel, but a true wonder all round, because the fact that Martel's novel actually works (rather well, at that) as a film is quite a miracle, and for Ang Lee should applauded.","10/10"
"dubond","31 January 2024","Don't let the January burial deter you from THE BEEKEEPER, a wild action thriller that works by enthusiastically embracing just how ludicrous it is, with every member of the cast, even down to the smallest role, knowing exactly what kind of movie they're in.In one of his best films, Jason Statham *IS* Adam Clay, a loner beekeeper renting a barn on the property of elderly widow Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise commits suicide after losing her entire savings in a computer virus phishing scam, Clay vows that those reponsible will pay, and he'd preferably do so without the involvement of Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Clay manages to find the office complex of the data mining outfit that conned Eloise, takes out several security goons and burns the place to the ground. All of this happens in the first ten minutes, which gives you an idea of just how hard THE BEEKEEPER hits the ground running and never stops. The data mining outfit is one of many overseen by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), a douchey, skateboarding billionaire tech bro rich kid who leaves the legalities and the paperwork to absurdly-named trusted family friend Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons), a former CIA director who has agreed to run the Danforth dynasty in the place of Derek's absent mother. When Westwyld reaches out to the current CIA director (Minnie Driver) and is told that all evidence points to Clay being a ""beekeeper,"" she wishes Westwyld the best of luck and extricates herself and the agency from the situation.What follows is absolute madness that almost makes this Statham's PUNISHER: WAR ZONE. It's the best film in years from either director David Ayer, who's a much better writer (TRAINING DAY, DARK BLUE) than a filmmaker (HARSH TIMES, SABOTAGE, SUICIDE SQUAD, BRIGHT, THE TAX COLLECTOR) or journeyman screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who's never lived up to the promise of 2002's EQUILIBRIUM. There's a jaw-dropper of a reveal midway through that I won't spoil, but this is Statham at his stoical, vengeful best, a welcome return to form after last fall's unwatchable EXPEND4BLES fiasco.THE BEEKEEPER is impossible to take seriously on any level, other than the palpable rage it shows toward greedy tech outfits that would con the elderly (it also doesn't seem likely that the FBI would let Verona work a case that indrectly involves her mother), but once all the pieces are in play, it also takes some pointed jabs at much bigger subjects. With perhaps the fewest lines he's ever had in a movie, Statham creates one of his most memorable and merciless characters, and the over-the-top, cathartically crowd-pleasing ways The Beekeeper comes up with to dispose of the bad guys had the small matinee audience rolling with laughter. Yeah, CGI explosions are apparently always gonna blow, but we've already got a contender for the year's most stupidly entertaining movie.","7/10"
"duggies70","13 January 2024","Overall it was ok. Maybe I think it's ok because everything in the theater has been just so bad. But you can always improve. I guess what I find the most objectionable is the lack of professionalism with the FBI. I am not a fan of them, but having worked with them for years, the one thing they are is professional. They also don't usually become chubby and obnoxious until they are much higher up. So seeing someone in blue jeans briefing their supervisor or at a crime scene isn't going to happen. They're never first on scene, they really aren't Pigsknuckle Arkansas PD.The fight scenes are terrific. Statham is himself and excellent as the stoic antihero.However, the addition of the clown security group was almost too much to take, not to mention the ""carnival"" at the Presidential home.I do enjoy the apparent commentary on our dysfunctional Executive Branch of the US. Is it this bad? I sure hope not.Is our movie as good as it could have been, certainly not.","6/10"
"dummykenmen","28 April 2019","I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations.","7/10"
"duoasf","24 April 2019","I want to begin by saying that had this been a standalone movie I would have probably given it a 4 or 5, but for this particular movie, the movie of the decade, the big conclusion everything was leading up to, mediocre-ness is worse than complete failure. We were promised a masterpiece and we received something that what so-so at best.
I'll break down what I think went wrong, so spoilers ahead:
The biggest issue with this movie is the ever-paradoxical use of time travel. Unless you are making a silly comedy like ""Back to the Future"" it always messes with continuity and no matter how well you try to explain that the canon reality does not just collapse under the paradox, it is always going to feel like the lazy way out, and so it did in this one. Steve deciding to go rogue back to the 40s, thus ignoring all the character development he went through and irreparably messing with every timeline is not exactly the extremely satisfying closure we were promised in interviews with directors and actors. Overall I suppose the expectations were just so high that nothing could have lived up to it, but with the amounts of money and the access to great creators Marvel has I really would have expected something else- something as creative and mind-blowing as they promised instead of the honestly mediocre at best time-travel flick we got. Messing with timelines and essentially de-canonizing large chunks of the MCU just was not what I was hoping for.
Another thing I had a problem with is that this movie was supposed to perfectly conclude every character's arc so far. We were promised a suitable ending of some journeys and at least a crucial point in everyone else's. Instead, Black Widow was killed without ever even allowing her to develop a character. Thor, who could have been the ideal king of Asgard was turned into a fatphobic joke by equating his chubbiness with sloppiness (personally, I liked his new look. Thor looked rather like a man who is strong from physical labour than planned workouts and diet plans, but the way they dressed him in dirty clothes, made him lazy and greasy is just so terrible), while the lessons he learned in Ragnarok and the sacrifices he made did not seem to have any effect at all; the loyalty he felt to his people completely disappeared. Iron Man was ripped of his peaceful retirement, where for the first time he was allowed to try to heal, just because someone had to die dramatically.
Don't misunderstand me, I am not bitter that they killed off beloved characters, in fact I understand that it had to happen, however I would have loved to see them take the characters' arcs into account. In my opinion, Steve should have died because he has no place in either the future or the past, and his mission is completed. Tony, on the other hand, should have lived because he finally made an effort to heal and overcome his trauma. I don't mean to suggest that one or another character should or should not have died, I only think I might have been able to accept the way things turned out if there was a reasonable plot leading up to it that made their death a logical conclusion. The Marvel movies are fictional and everyone who goes to watch them is very aware of the fact that there is a team of writers and creators who crafted everyone's arc and worked on it for a long time. I would have appreciated to watch the outcome reflect the amount of work and time I am sure many people put into this project.
Ultimately I have to admit that the messages we get to take away from this film are what really made me sad: People with trauma don't deserve to heal, people's actions and experiences have seemingly no consequences, and friendship and found family mean nothing against the ideal of a romantic relationship.This is a very long movie and so there are many more things I could address, for example the ""Hail Hydra"" scene, Steve wielding Mjolnir, how similar this movie was to the last one, Loki's unexplained disappearance in the past timeline, the cheap attempt of making up for the lack of lgbt heroes by showing a mlm extra in one scene, the list goes on. But all those things seem somehow related to the major issues I addressed earlier. Perhaps the hype was too big, perhaps the team did get lazy and rested on the success of the franchise or perhaps it is just me expecting too much from a superhero movie.
Regardless, if you loved this movie, I see your point, it is in many ways what we were expecting, but what I was hoping for was something new, something revolutionary that would surprise and amaze me. Maybe in another ten or twenty years we will get that movie I thought this was going to be, but I am afraid that by then I will not be interested anymore.","10/10"
"dussaultjulien","26 January 2019","Peter Quill was a competent, somewhat stupid and impulsive, character to begin with but he was not mentally handicapped. People praise The Russo Brothers for this film, even going as far as to say that this film is the ""best superhero movie ever."" That is not true and if you're too blind to see that this movie was worse than Age of Ultron, which comparably was pretty bad itself, but this takes the cake and you shouldn't watch, or rate, superhero movies. Don't for a moment think that Avengers: Endgame will be any better. When you write a film so full of plot holes that it may as well have been filmed through a cheese grater, you should not be praised as great directors, or even called writers at that point either. You should be bent over the knee and spanked and then scolded for writing, and directing such a bad movie.I've never uttered these words before but Ang Li's Hulk with Eric Banna was better than this film.","1/10"
"dussaultjulien","30 July 2019","I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired","10/10"

And continue to improve the protagonist's growth process under the former's promotion, coupled with a larger perspective and setting, which makes this film more cool than the previous one, more moving, more artistic viewing, but it can be more so, can not be separated from its main role of transition, if the next one wants to continue the brilliance of the first two, it is difficult.","5/10"

"EasternZZ","22 March 2018","You saw the trailers, you were expecting this to be as awesome as Dawn and Rise, but the truth is this movie takes such a completely different tone that it just leaves you wanting to go back and watch Dawn and Rise again.~The biggest problem with this movie is the LACK OF ACTION. This movie barely has any action. The trailers and the title was hinting at a giant epic battle but in reality it is actually really small and it only lasts for about 5 minutes at the end.~The story started off great but halfway through, it suddenly become ""12 Years a Slave"" mixed with ""Passion of the Christ"" mixed with ""Schindler's List"" mixed with ""The Great Escape."" The second half drags on and on forever. It is extremely slow and they spent at least 45-60 minutes in this prison camp. There is only so much you can watch an ape get whipped and tortured before you end up getting bored.~The way the filmmakers decided to end the big battle at the end is a giant cop out. Throughout the movie they hint at a giant mass army of men who will come and attack. When the time does come, OUT OF NOWHERE an avalanche comes and ends the battle. It is one of the worst cop outs I have ever seen honestly.+) Andy is great as always, same with all of the character actors.+) Woody Harrison is great as always, but they end his story arc so sudden and it really leaves you empty inside.Overall I guess if you are a huge fan of Rise and Dawn (Like me, I saw Dawn 3x in theaters), you will want to see how they end Ceasar's arc. You will leave a little disappointed at the lost potential that a movie call ""WAR for the planet of the apes"" could have had. This is NOT a movie to watch at night with a group of friends while drinking and eating food. YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP during the second half.","7/10"
"Eblogary","27 February 2023","I have watched all of the phase 4, and it is much better than anything released in the previous phase. The acting of Jonathan Majors was fabulous. Every scene of Kang felt menacing. The movie established Kang as the big villain of MCU pretty well.However, the potential of Wasp and MODOK was wasted as they received very little run time. MODOK was just a comedy relief character. VFX were great. The MODOK with big head looked goofy but that's how it should look like. The MODOK did not look unrealistic unlike the floating head in Thor 4.There were some plot-holes, and logical mistakes but overall it was fun, as comic book movies should be. It had some good jokes, but they did not feel unnecessary like the jokes in Thor 4. In comparison with Thor 4, and Doctor Strange 2, it was a much better movie.","7/10"

"Ed-Shullivan","8 July 2023","Oh this was such a big disappointment on so many levels. Have we not been subjected over the past two decades with an inordinate number of endless (and I do mean endless!) car chases? In this case Harrison Ford is driving a vehicle commonly referred to as a three (3) wheel trike. Then we have to struggle with seeing the old geezer Harrison Ford make every effort as an octogenarian (he will turn 81 on July 13th) to run away from trouble with his much younger accomplice the 37 year old Phoebe Waller-Bridge. In comparison would anyone in their right mind want to still see a 74 year old Terry Bradshaw quarterback the Pittsburgh Steelers football game against the 37 year old Matt Ryan?I was so bored after the first 45 minutes of these endless chase scenes overflowing with CGI that when the end credits outlined the hundreds and more hundreds of animators and visual illustrators I was not surprised that this (5th) fifth and seemingly final Indiana Jones movie had no extra Easter Egg scenes after the credits start rolling because the film had already run long enough that the audience I attended with ALL left except for Mrs. Shullivan, her two sisters and myself before the end credits had finished.I am a big fan of sequels and trilogies and even franchises, and I have a big heart when it comes to embracing a character such as Indiana Jones. Did you know De-Aging Harrison Ford In Indiana Jones 5 Took 3 Years & 100+ VFX Artists? I think the producers of this fifth title in the franchise could have taken a page from the James Bond series and chosen a younger more agile Indiana Jones by film number five (5). Instead the producers decided in the third of the five film series, the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, they introduced an aging Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father. How ironic that instead of going younger, the producers chose to double down and go older in film number (3) three of their franchise.The feeling of adventure was lost on me, and I may be getting older, but I still know a bad movie when I am exposed to it and this fifth film in the franchise series was a big no for me.I can barely give it a 5 out of 10 IMDb rating.","6/10"
"eddie_baggins","1 June 2023","Not even the most optimistic of pundits could've ever predicted the glowing reception and success that came the way of 2018's Into the Spider-Verse, slinging to almost $400 million at the worldwide box office, critical praise and a spot entrenched in the upper echelons of the IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Time list, too say that the first iteration of the Spider-Verse animated universe was a roaring and unexpected success would be a huge understatement.Fast forward these close to 5 years on and expectations for teenager Miles Morales/Spider-Man next adventure are sky high but proving that lightning can strike twice, the creative team behind this colourful Spider-Man series overseen by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have once again delivered a frenetic, energetic and most importantly entertaining animated epic that will likely cause much debate as to whether or not this is a case of a rare sequel that may in fact be better than its forefather.Still featuring the oddball humour and near endless parade of in-jokes, homages and side gags that made the first Morales venture such a delight outside of its visual spectacle, Across the Spider-Verse also feels like a much more mature outing this time around, with Morales himself more world weary and battered, coinciding with the film as a whole dealing with some heavy issues and subject matters that at times brings on an unexpectedly sombre tone, with credit going to the creative team here for not being afraid to make their film skew further from the young audience that may not quite understand the nuances on display here all the while allowing older audience members to feast on a film that is far from all style and no substance.Clocking in at close to two and a half hours, Across the Spider-Verse is one of the longest animated films ever widely released into cinemas and there are segments throughout the film where it feels as though we are covering off similar narrative ground on more than one occasion but when Morales adventure into the Multiverse swings into the sky it takes us on an often unforgettable journey, whether it be to a New York done the way of Mumbai or a Spider-filled version of Earth, Across the Spider-Verse has enough imagination and spark to fill countless other animated rides that would be desperate for even a portion of the creative magic on display here.As also was the case the first time around in 2018, this 2023 Spider-Verse features another array of on-song voice performances from its talented cast that works in tandem with the incredible artistry on display throughout, led once more by Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, new additions to the voice cast here such as a scene-stealing Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Jason Schwartzman as The Spot or Daniel Kaluuya as Hobart Brown all bring their A-game to this big budgeted affair, making this an all-round package that has not only lived up to the legacy of the first instalment but arguably surpassed it.Even if there's a feeling of being teased by possibilities once the credits begin to roll here, the hype is going to be overflowing for next years Beyond the Spider-Verse which is setting out to prove that lightning can indeed strike more than twice.Final Say -People may bemoan the amount of Spider-Man themed films we've had slung our way over the past 20 years but if the quality of these outings remains as strong as what we get here with Across the Spider-Verse, they're going to be complaining for a long time yet to come.4 Chai tea's out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","10/10"
"eddie_baggins","16 February 2023","Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","7/10"
"eddie_baggins","24 April 2019","DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5","9/10"
"eden-rabatsch","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","9/10"

"educallejero","24 January 2019","The writing. My freaking god, the god awful writing was insufferable. The story was meaningless and it didn't improve the non-canon version from the 90's.All the characters were respected (contrary to the more childish, yes even way more childish DBSuper movies), but also totally boring. There was no tension of any kind, and even if I like were the movie went at the end, there were a millon better ways to get there.Another thing: At some point a character has to evolve. If it doesn't, what's the point of having these repetetive stories? It's always fighting a tough villain, so without character development, it gets really boring.The movie was slow, and the storytelling ""5 years old inclusive"" (which might be a great commercial decision, but I'm not 5, so it got into my nerves).It felt pure DBZ, no question, but also... it felt EXACTLY 1990 pure DBZ!Itsn't 2019 already? Why not use DIFFERENT CHARACTERS to showcase different emotions and relationships and grow? That won't happen if you only use Vegeta and Goku.-----
Having said that: Yes, the movie was atrocious in almost every way. But also, the spectacle was the best that DBZ has ever shown. The animation, and different animation techniques, plus the ""choreography"" was INSANE. In that important aspect, it was a 10. When you take account for the atrocious ""0 points"" deserving story, you get the five.--------

"edwardrevans","12 January 2024","This is and out and out action flick with a very high and constant body count and a plot that slightly goes off the rails so you have to suspend belief. Essentially we have Adam Clay (Statham) who is a ghost in the system, retired until trouble comes knocking on a neighbour and friends door, so he comes out of retirement to avenge her suicide after she is defrauded by some online scammers. Now this is where I had the problem, as it transpires his friends daughter is an FBI agent who herself is torn between wanting revenge for her mothers death through what she eventually finds out who Clay is but also hunts him down to stop him. Putting that quandary aside (though it did bother me) the movie quickly marches on with everyone getting involved from the police to the FBI, hired mercenaries and even members from his secret organisation but why, well it becomes fairly obvious someone is that they all are trying to protect someone at the very top i.e the President. Statham does these movies very well especially the fight sequences as they are very inventive, so if you just want an all out fight fest then this is for you. No doubt if this makes money we will see more of the Beekeeper.","6/10"

After watching the trailer it was obvious the film was going to be a no nonsense action film, and it delivered no questions asked. So if this type of film is not your cup of tea why watch it.Utterly brilliant and a must watch for those who love action films.","8/10"
"ekamjitsingh-30851","31 July 2021","Dragon ball super broly the best movie of the whole db franchise. Man everyone just love this film because we just got our favourite badass villain and that is Broly, and our favourite fusion character Gogeta. The animation was at whole another level. The fight scenes were way too legendary. Haha man I was so freaked out when I saw the movie. I was just thinking about the characters and the fight scenes and in this movie we even got to see Vegeta turned Super Sayain God for the first time (red hair form). The fighting scene of broly with goku and vegeta and gogeta were so good. I really enjoyed watching this movie. Keep it up.","10/10"

"elenaphysics","13 July 2017","OK , let us begin. This movie is not good. I enjoyed rise of the planet of the apes, I did not much enjoy the dawn of the planet of the Apes, but what I certainly did not like was this one. If you remove the nice cinematography, if you remove the apes and substitute them with people, do you know what you will see? You will see a bunch of movies you have already watched before. Nothing special. What really stuns me, are the weird religious symbolism in this movie.And also historical symbolism. They were not necessary , and took away the originality of the film. The whole thing with the Crucifixions. OK they were not crucified, they were tied with ropes on crosses, not making the + cross symbol but the x mark like a ''crux decussata'' of saint Andreas. Anyway, the military camp which becomes a concentration camp for the apes, where they are forced to work, looks so much like Auschwitz- Birkenau. The story of the Jews and the Holocost has been in so many movies, and Auschwitz holds a special place in those movies. Just , don't turn this movie in to a Holocaust movie. Where apes are the jews and the Nazi-like character of Colonel wants to exterminate them. The whole Nazi thing is prevalent in this movie. The way soldiers obey, the colonel shaving his head, the fact that he killed his son because after he got infected by the virus because he stopped being human (therefore pure like the Nazis wanted to be) The soldier whose live was spared, and seemed to respect Ceasar in a way, was the one who killed him. It was like an element of surprise ,but I have seen it in about 10 movies already. In the end Ceasar, as another Moses from the Bible, leads the Apes (jews) to the land of Canaan. I have watched Moses movies so many times. I do not want another Bible movie. Also the character of little zoo ape who could talk, was supposed to be funny. But it wasn't. Actually it reminded me of the lost and disoriented Gollum from the Lord of the Rings. Which can not be a coincidence, since Andy Serkis was actually the Gollum in those movies. Seriously the movie was bad. Don't watch it. But I am afraid the you will because everyone is tempted to watch the end of a trilogy.","10/10"
"elgsdyr","2 August 2019","I watched this the day after ploughing through the first season of 'The Boys'. What an anti-climax... If you want a super hero story that's intelligent, incredibly well-written, and with really interesting characters, go watch that instead... And in the MCU context, the first Avengers film is a much better example of good writing and directing, where the characters actually had some wit and.. yeah, well... character....The best thing I can say about Avengers: Endgame is that it very early on killed off Thanos and the Infinity Stones. That was unexpected and opened up the possibilities for the rest of the film. Except that it went straight on to a classic time-travel solution and makes a big deal out of this not being at all like described in any other film (except that it's exactly the same) along with an abundance of other cliches and plot holes (well described in the many other critical reviews here). The characters and their lines were generally bland and completely without the wit and bite as seen in the earlier Joss Whedon versions. And the ending was just as painfully slow as LotR: The Return of the King (yet another over-hyped blockbuster) with long-drawn-out overly sentimental scenes that added nothing to the story.6/10 = OK (just)","10/10"
"elhamfirmino","17 February 2023","The third movie was totally different than the previous movies. It is definitely more brutal and serious, but still had its moments when I felt familiar with the movie. With that said there were scenes were I was like ' I've seen that somewhere else'. Known cliches and jokes are included. I find them funny. The CGI for the fights and specially for the scenes where Scott multiplies himself multiple times were cool. I'm really not a fan ob having basically too much CGI in a movie, but this movie needs that and I'm convinced, that had they had more budget they'd have done even more into CGI. Although I enjoyed the movie it should've been different cause some scenes felt like they were shorten to fit the screen time which is understandable. The issue is there were too many characters into the plot. I get the message it's more of a family adventurous movie. Hank+Janet+Hope+Scott+Cassie, but just for me Hope felt unnecessary for the plot. Janet was necessary because she already was there and has a secret to tell. I wouldn't rate this movie low or very high. It's a 7/10 for me and a decent introduction for Phase 5.Paul Rudd's performance is convincing, vividly and charming. I don't remember one movie I didn't enjoy with him. He's Ant-Man. His performance was hilarious and mushy in deep moments.Two days ago I've went to the local cinema to finally witness Kang The Conquerer in action. Jonathan Majors was brilliant he embodies the character in such an unique way. He can play it off real quick from a soft and sad character into an terrifying dangerous threat. That's some amazing act and needs to be called. I was surprised about the dynamic between Janet & Kang. We get to see a throwback segment and find out more about Kang and Janet's time when she vanished into the quantum level.","4/10"
"elhamfirmino","2 June 2023","I went to the premier with high expectations and came back happy with a drill of anticipation for continuation. This film sets completely new standards from which every studio can learn something.FilmAt the beginning we dive into Gwen's world and shockingly you realize in disbelief how the animation has developed after 5 years. The graphics, transitions, transition of specific colors, the movement of the characters, facial expressions and the atmosphere is unbelievably good. I mean the first movie already made you feel you go through a comic, but Across The Spider-Verse is the next level of animation. With approximately 150.000.000$ budget the result is impressive and totally worth it. I loved every bit of it and no 140 minutes didn't fell too long. When the film was over I was like go on do another 2 hours I WANT MORE OF THIS. Huge respect to Chris Miller & Phil Lord and the entire crew for making this possible.The plot no spoilerIt takes place 16 months after the events of the fire movie. Miles Morales is Spider-Man and has to deal with the daily businesses. He struggles to keep his relationship with his parents, always comes late and has little to no time. One day he faces The Spot a new villain and from there I leave you out without spoilers. The Spot fits in this topic and movie so good. He was the right choice. His design is crazy and his motives are so well written.MultiverseI have to say Across The Spider-Verse did catch the Multiverse topic perfectly. MCU needs to note so many things here. It's actually insane how great they showed the possibilities, diversities and complexities of it. For me, they surpassed No Way Home in terms of Multiverse. Of course Animation is a different tool, but still the story telling and how they made you feel like this movie is not only for kids it's actually more complex and for fans and more like for everyone. The concept of that was nailed perfect. You really do not feel twisted or lost like in several MCU Multiverse projects.To come to an conclusion I think it's safe to say this movie is gonna win another Oscar and is so far in a great cinema year for me the best movie. Wow, I'm so grateful for this movie. I want to watch it again. Go to the cinema right now. This is a true masterpiece. 10/10 Genre and overall everything was perfect. The voice actors did an amazing job too.","10/10"

Geez, feels like I just watched the rest of the movie in 30 seconds... Listen. Too much MINDLESS ANIME.. 80% of the characters are too cartoonish... Like it came out of a Cartoon Network universe... Please bring back the original DragonBall Z graphics and art style instead of thiss.. thisss bs Mickey Mouse dreadful animation... (Like Vegeta & Raditz as a kid)... The fighting transportation scenes are nice, a bit over kill in some scenes but it's okay just make it more understandable...The ''sexual'' space girl who's suppose to replace Bulma.. is a bit too much.. With her touching, showing off her body is coming off as being over seductive... Please don't make it as the other 99% of sexual mindless anime shows on funimation & crunchyroll... and Broly's father wearing that pink mini shirt??.... Once again... CALM DOWWNN....Overall this tv was funny.. Typical Goku and Vageta. The new babysitter?? Hilarious.. I would've gave it a 7 or 8 out of 10 but all the mindless animations truly brings it down.. It doesn't look like a Dragonball series tv show anymore... If they keep on doing it this way all the original fans will loose interest on this 4-5 year old kid cartoon tv show that it will eventually become... Ughh...","7/10"

It's a great setup for the next movie and if that one is nearly as good then this trilogy could be considered not just one of the best in animation but one of the best trilogies ever made period.

"ElMaruecan82","26 March 2017","Every once in a while, a movie keeps you marveling at the beauty of its imagery while captivating your mind with its intellectual richness, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is such a movie where images speak a thousand words, so is ""Life of Pi"" with a difference though: it is pretty vocal about its content. To a certain degree, the film embodies the number 'Pi' whose mathematical function and simple writing are only the tip of an iceberg of infinite immensity.Still, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a delight for the eyes before the mind, a stunt even more impressive as 2012 eyes used to think they saw it all (3 years after ""Avatar"" and less than a decade after Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings""). Some shots reminded me of that line from ""Forrest Gump"" who was running across a desert and the morning light cast such a glow that he couldn't tell where Heaven stopped and the Earth began. And ""Life of Pi"" is fertile in such shots where you can't tell the limits between the sky and the water, and it is no coincidence that the story is a metaphysical quest à la Paolo Coelho, of a boy drifting across the Pacific Ocean with a tiger, of all the companions.God is obviously the 'guy-up-there' incarnated by the skies and the stars and Pi addresses him many times by raising his head, but when the sky and the water seems to make one, which might imply that Pi can find God, or try to, by looking at the ocean or in the eye of his feline companion of misfortune. Pi was named after Piscine Molitor which was the most beautiful swimming pool his uncle ever swam in, and in the scene showing the Parisian pool, the water is so clear, the man feels like floating in the air, it is not just gratuitous effects but the display of a heavenly, ecstatic moment, where the body and the mind are in total symbiosis. This is how the uncle found God anyway.To avoid the mockeries, Piscine calls himself 'Pi' and is so motivated that he becomes a champion of the Pi number and could memorize thousands of the decimal pieces, the cheers of his comrades making up for years of urological nicknames. But don't get mislead, the film is only about mathematics if you use the Galilean metaphor of the alphabet with which God wrote the universe. This is a language Pi is eager to decrypt, driven by his childlike curiosity, Hindu myths and Gods fascinate him, so does the story of Jesus Christ who died as an innocent for all the humans' sins, and he also finds peace and serenity while recalling the name of Allah during his prayers. Pi's ecumenical openness inevitably crashes into his father's rationality.""Appa"", a zoo owner, is a practical man who doesn't believe in religion, he eats meat and would rather have a son sticking to strong opinions rather than believing in everything, being as ""irrational"" and unlimited as the like-named number. So, it's the father who puts limits in his son's idealism where he sees him trying to feed the tiger (named Richard Parker), believing animals have soul. The father proves him wrong by tying a goat to the cage and showing him how the animals deal together. Animals have no souls, it is only the reflect of humans' soul, the metaphor for religion is obvious. We only see God through our own eyes, how ironic though that the father uses a sacrifice of such heavy religious undertones to make his point. As for Pi, the matters of God are forgotten for a time.And it takes that extraordinary journey where he's stuck with the tiger and has to learn how to tame it, to feed it so it doesn't think of eating him, to state his presence, mark his territory, to establish a way to communicate with the animal, until finally, Pi concludes his metaphysical quest. The tiger becomes his enemy but also his ticket for life. I won't spoil right now how the adventure connects with God, but it is all done in that conclusive last rhetorical question, where Pi creates his own myth, which like all myths, explains a fact through a story that might sound ludicrous but whose universal appeal is undeniable. Because that's what myths are: stories that go beyond our own perceptions, that seems impossible yet challenge our thinking to such a point that their nonexistence seems as unbelievable as the opposite.While I was watching the film, I was mesmerized by the special effects, the interactions between Pi and the tiger, even with the other animals. And I was almost disappointed to learn it was CGI, it didn't look like CGI to me, for some reason, it felt ""plausible"", too beautiful to be artificial. But maybe that is the ground broken by Ang Lee. In 1914, a man shared a screen with a dinosaur, in 1964 one danced with penguins, in 1988, one was handcuffed to a rabbit, in 1993, dinosaurs came back in the form of CGI creatures, their realness was undeniable but it still asked for our suspension of disbelief. ""Life of Pi"" is the only one where the animals are meant to be and look real, that the magic of the film would take a 'normal form' to better fool us.Some would say that God was a creation by humans but maybe the idea of God is so beautiful that humans only tries to make it approachable, like God who used the figure of Jesus, or Muslims when they pray or Hindus with all their Gods. Maybe less than the form of God, is the idea itself, maybe Cinema is like religion or myths, after all, it is all about suspension of disbelief, but for a purpose that is essential to the human soul.","9/10"
"elonmusk-is_a_moron","13 August 2022","Animation wise, this movie is excellent. Dragon Ball movies never looked this good before.I also liked the introduction, revealing more details of the Saiyan life.And the fight scenes were simple wonderful.But a couple of things left a sour taste in my mouth:First, and more importantly, the awful characterization of Goku which started in Dragon Ball Super (Yes, I know Toriyama said Goku is ""not a hero"" like Superman, but there is a line between being a hero, and befriending guys that regularly commit genocide)He is an idiot here. A totally unlikeable idiot with no more thoughts other than ""I must fight strong guys"". So, so annoying.We have reached the point where Vegeta, a former cruel villain from this series, is more heroic than him. If Super continues this path, soon even Nappa would be more heroic than him.The second, is Frieza.I see some fans already claiming Frieza is the ""Joker"" of the Dragon Ball Franchise. For me, that is awful. Look, I do not hate Batman, but one of the reasons of why I preferred manga over the DC or Marvel comics, it's because there is real progress in the stories, the villains (and some heroes) stay dead, instead of keeping an eternal status quo where nothing can never change: This is made purely for commercial purposes; the real reason Batman cannot kill the Joker is not because the writers want to make a profound statement about how ""killing is wrong"", but is made because the editors are afraid of losing the Joker hardcore fans as part of their readership.So, no matter what, Batman can never kill the Joker, and he always keeps escaping from Arkam asylum and nothing ever changes.I hate the status quo from superhero western comics, because it totally squanders any form of character development in favor of endless pandering.So yeah, the last thing I would want for Dragon Ball is to follow that route. I can get over Frieza coming back to life once. I can get over the addition of another Frieza looalike character. So resurrecting him a second time (And by Goku, no less!) was way too much.Worse, at the end of the horrible Dragon Ball Super, he gets away scott-free, and this movie shows him continuing his genocide on the galaxy. And Goku? He simply does not care, and allows Frieza to roam free (Despite the clear warning Vegeta gave to him, about how ridiculously strong Frieza could get just by training a couple of months)This movie, like the horrible, horrid Dragon Ball Super, is just another victory for Frieza. He got away with everything, and they try to pass this as a ""happy ending"". Now Goku is just one step away of being best pals with the same guy that killed all his people.It might sound like nit-picking, but it kinda ruins my enjoyment of this movie, disregard of the positive elements. I cannot stand the new Peter Griffin Goku that only cares about fighting and befriends genocidal tyrants because he is ""not a hero"".But hey, at least the animation was nice. And New good Broly is an ok character.","10/10"

"EmmaDinkins","23 November 2012","As someone who had not read the Life of Pi book, I really did not have any knowledge of this story or what to expect other than what I had seen in the trailer. It seemed like it would be an interesting enough tale and I was curious about what had transpired to bring a young man and a Bengal tiger together in a life boat. This was a spiritual journey that I was so thrilled to have experienced on the big screen. The entire story was filled with opposing ideologies beginning with Pi's discovery of religion. It was interesting that he was able to take a rational look at various religions and apply the teachings to his life that were beneficial, even life saving. The Life of Pi was profoundly engaging, I knew that Pi (Suraj Sharma) would survive the lost at sea ordeal, but none of the intensity of the story was diminished as a result of knowing the outcome. The imagery in this film was spectacular, from the opening scene credits I knew that I was in for a treat when a hummingbird was just inches from my face and literally within my reach. The scenes in which the ocean and the star filled sky seemed to merge into one were breathtaking. I made it a point to view this film in 3-D and it was worth every penny of the premium uplift, and we all know that not all 3-D films are. I'm not sure why anyone would mention Avatar and this film in the same context, although I just did because of the reference in the trailer, but other than the luminescent sea life, the two films have so little in common that it's like someone was reaching to describe the feeling that this story evokes. I love stories that showcase triumph of the human spirit as was the case with this one, but best of all you leave the theater feeling good about life in general, not guilty that your life has been average and happy, not shadowed by some tragedy that makes you evolve into a different person. The two stories told in this film that detailed what happened to Pi (Irrfan Khan) were opposites, I too preferred the one that featured Richard Parker. I was not a fan of the Cowboy story directed by Ang Lee, but am truly enamored by this Indian story, cowboys and Indians still dealing with opposites. This was a good story and I give it a green light.","10/10"

"eoinageary","12 July 2023","I had tried to stay away from trailers to avoid as much as I can and wow, I am blown away.The story is good, it's a follow up to the previous where Miles is still struggling to balance the spider life and being a kid, he is missing his multiverse friends and especially Gwen. The movie really gets going when a new villain called spot who can travel through holes to anywhere is demolished by miles and insulted. He plans to grow his powers, creating the ability to multiverse travel. The story goes on and it's hard to say as it continues after spoilers but things MUST happen but Miles can't accept it.The animation was AMAZING,seeing miles and Gwen swing through NY was perfect, it goes along with a pitch perfect score, there was once or twice the voices were quite low behind the music but that could have been the cinema. I also love that there are 2 major different sides when it comes to Miles and Spider-Man 2099, and I can 100% see both sides !!!Obviously it's around Miles but this movie is equally Gwens movie, she has gone through and is going through a lot. The supporting characters were all great and this movie is genuinely funny.This is not a spoiler but the movie ends on a cliffhanger and the third movie is scheduled for next year.

"eonbluedan-1","22 December 2012","Pi Patel, played for the most part by Suraj Sharma with a confidence defying his absolute inexperience in front of the camera, and surely qualifying him for a Best Actor nod at the Oscars, is thrust into an adventure of survival at sea. The ship carrying his family and their zoo hits bad waters, inexplicably sinks, and from there he must learn how to share the confined space of a lifeboat with his only companion, a tiger named Richard Parker.Like 'Cast Away', due to its idea a great deal of the film is without speech, save for Pi's one way conversations with the animal and the occasional narration by adult Pi, played by a spectacular Irrfan Khan, who is telling his tale to an author, one who is after a great story that will ""make you believe in God"". Also much like another of this year's spectaculars, 'The Hobbit', the front end of the movie is loaded with a lot of setup, which those who who only saw the trailer may find surprisingly hefty. Unlike 'The Hobbit', however, this front end engages you fast and it is not long before you are enjoying the development of Pi as a character, the amusing finding of his faith, his love, and his place in the family. Some genuinely hearty and smart humour can be found in this first act, also. The brilliance is that whilst it is not in any rush to get where we all know it is headed, at no point is there any wish for Lee to push it along faster; there is some understanding intrinsic to the direction that this is all important and not to be overlooked, which even those who have not read the hugely popular book pick up on. To add to this, it must be said that the length and pacing of this movie is outstanding; you would not want any more or less time spent basking in the warmth of the love and care that clearly went into putting every single gorgeous frame on the screen. The second act is where we really see the film kick into gear and start rolling out what is stunning audiences and critics alike. From the greatest CGI animal I think I have seen on the silver screen, to the overwhelmingly beautiful photography, effects, and perhaps not the first, but certainly the best use of 3D technology to enhance the engagement with a story, 'Life Of Pi' sweeps the floor visually with anything previously held up as a bar setter. Nothing against those previous movies, but it really does. All of this is obviously nothing without everything else being in place, and thankfully Ang Lee knows that the heart of his film is not how pretty it is, but the story by Yann Martel and the themes with which it deals. So what is 'Life Of Pi' about? The wonderful thing about this piece is that this answer could be different for you than it was for me. It is about a boy surviving at sea with a tiger. It is about the nature of life, death and loss. It is about the balance of fear and respect. It is about love and hope. It is about humanity and compassion. It is about religion and faith, faith not just in a higher power, but in anything in the world. It is about all of these things at once, but what I most took away from this film is how it is about the nature of nature itself. Yes, it sounds heavy and preachy, doesn't it? The truth is Lee gets the balance absolutely spot on; you take from the movie what you want and at no point does it preach at you about anything. It does not matter how you walk in, an atheist, a Hindu, a Christian, but if you are a human being with anything close to an open heart and mind, you might just walk out feeling a better person! Released for the festive season, it is an oddly uplifting film that entertains on one hand, and on the other is positively philosophical about our place in nature, our treatment of her, and of one another. Not often would I say that a film might just change your life, but as the film reached its finale, with both Sharma and Khan absolutely owning their respective final scenes, I realised I had been inescapably moved to tears more than once, had consciously assessed how I think about certain things, and that yes, this film just might change you for the better. Is the preceding challenge to make a character believe in God achieved? That would be telling, but more importantly, it does not matter; in a rather smart bit of writing and beautiful execution, the film underlines that this is not really the point, and indeed should never be. Ang Lee is a man who directs with a heart full of compassion, and a head full to its brim with an understanding of cinema's sheer power to entertain, engage and challenge, sometimes all at once. A look at his previous work is evidence enough of this; sure, not everything is a hit, but never could his passion for cinema, bravery and humanity, be more on show than with 'Life Of Pi'. He has done what was said to be impossible, taken a book that should never have translated to cinema, and not only made a successful film, but made the all-round best spectacular to hit the big screen since Nolan's 'Inception'! A loss at the Oscars for its visuals and adaption for screen, at the very least, would be a sin! Regardless of one's reaction to the movie, Ang Lee may well have created his masterpiece.","8/10"
"eparazak","16 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is the latest installment to the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise. It takes place about five years after Dawn. Caesar is now leading the ape tribe to war against the U.S. army up north. After an accident in his tribe, he, alongside some of his closest friends like Maurice and Rocket go on a journey to avenge said tribe. Along the way, they run into a young girl as well as an ape who would help them out on their journey.Let me just start right off the bat by saying that if you went into this movie expecting one big fight throughout the entire thing, then you'd come out disappointed. That's not how I expected the movie to be like. I expected it to be more sophisticated and interesting than just being a pure war film. Just like the previous installments in the franchise, the movie manages to rely more on characters and themes rather than pure action and I think it was handled incredibly.One of my favorite things about this movie has to be how the narrative is told. For the majority of the film, Caesar is the main focus. He's given the most amount of screen time, we see into his thoughts. The movie doesn't often cut to human characters unless Caesar appears on screen. Essentially, this is his story through his perspective. As such, the dialogue is fairly limited. As such, we learn more about how a character feels through their expressions and thoughts rather than through words. Granted, there are some exceptions of this such as when the humans would speak, but we don't necessarily get that much time with them, contrary to what you may think.In the older installments, I didn't necessarily care for some of the other apes such as Maurice. I only found them to be side characters, and admittedly, some of them do stick around as side characters. In this case, it feels like the ape tribe that was established has grown into a family that I have grown to feel for. Believe me, the movie gets emotional at many points. For example, I like Maurice now more than ever now and it's not just because of the inclusion of Nova.Like Rise and Dawn, the acting was very well done with both apes and humans. The motion capture makes the apes look like they're real apes. If the motion capture technology is put to good use like with what the people did here, the creatures made using said technology can look fantastic. I'd call this one of the best examples of how motion capture can be done correctly, even if it's a continually developing technology.If there's one thing the movie could've done without, it would have to be a comic relief. Bad Ape is introduced midway into the movie and acts as the movie's comical character. To me, this wasn't necessary as it breaks the more serious mood of the movie on multiple occasions. Either way, I didn't think he was too distracting for the most part and I did laugh at his comical moments.If you're expecting a pure war film, you'll walk out of the theater disappointed. War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the summer's best movies to date with its engaging story, well-developed characters and harsh themes.10/10","10/10"
"EpicMovieCompilations","29 June 2023","Indiana Jones survives the events of his fifth adventure, yet the character George Lucas and Steven Spielberg brought to life in 1981 dies, well and truly... It's a shameful paradox Disney have orchestrated for the once-iconic part-time professor, in his dreary, uninspiring, dime-a-dozen ""send-off""... Producer Kathleen Kennedy and Director James Mangold are primarily to blame, as are stars Harrison Ford and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Broadly, the biggest problem I can point to, right off-the-bat, is the plot itself. If this is sincerely to be the last time we'll ever see Indiana Jones (which it certainly is) why choose to tell THIS particular story?Apparently, there's a titular dial called Antikythera, invented by the Syracusan mathematician Archimedes, capable of ""locating fissures in time"". That's how the movie explains it early on anyway, as if they're embarrassed to flat-out call it time-travel... The prologue features a de-aged Harrison Ford, up to some vintage shenanigans aboard a train in Germany, and look, I guess this scene tricks you into believing it's an actual Indiana Jones movie (briefly, mind you). Thomas Kretschmann shows up as a Nazi Lieutenant, and by all accounts, is the best antagonist in the movie. Meanwhile, Mads Mikkelson has his talents as an actor relegated by big-budget studios (yet again), opting to have him play a substandard villain instead. Just as baffling, is Boyd Holbrook's presence. A good actor, proving his chops as the bad guy in another James Mangold-directed feature, Logan (2017) - here given absolutely zero to do besides chase Indiana Jones and fire-off his pistol occasionally. Shaunette Renée Wilson appears solely to fill Disney's ethnic quota. That surely reads harsh, but I see no narrative purpose for her character. She's on the fence about the true allegiances of the U. S Agents she's working alongside... Then gets betrayed. This ties-up which plot-thread exactly? We already know Dr. Voller is a Nazi, so why play catch-up with her? The movie runs over two hours and thirty minutes due to filler like this... Antonio Banderas gets five minutes of screen-time before getting shot dead. Was there any reason Disney hired an actor of this caliber for such a minor role? He could've easily portrayed a major ally, as opposed to John Rhys Davies, reprising his role as Sallah for a lethargic, barely limber cameo. Ethann Isidore plays a discount Short-Round (Ke Huy Quan) called Teddy, who's also an adequate pilot. It's like the movie's aware of how farcical a detail this is, so near the finale, a military flyer happens to be sleeping in the back of a plane this kid commandeers. A military flyer. Sleeping in the back of a WWII-era bomber... How convenient. God forbid Teddy needs assistance up there... By the way, Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, Helena Shaw, somehow knows they'll need another flight back from 212 B. C (more on that later) so instructs for Teddy, her sidekick, to hijack that aircraft in particular. She doesn't accompany Teddy though, but finds a motorcycle on which she can pursue Indiana Jones, captive onboard another plane, mid take-off... The convolution cannot be overstated. Why not go with the kid on his first-ever flight? What you're left with is a logical error, that needed to be resolved during rewrites.Phoebe Waller-Bridge has no business appearing in an Indiana Jones movie, at least not to this specific capacity. She can be endearing, had the writers attempted to present her in such a light, and her wry sense of humour from Fleabag (2016 - 2019) doesn't necessarily come in handy here. ""Resourceful, daring, beautiful, self-sufficient"" is how Helena Shaw describes herself, verbatim, during a boring chase sequence through Tangier. This description is contrived enough to make a sensible audience member roll their eyes, and then, worse still, unnatural enough to take you out of the moment. Dangerous high-speed scenario, yeah? But forget about that for a sec, Helena needs to list-off her best feminine traits... Kathleen Kennedy won't tolerate subtlety I guess.The movie's budget allegedly tops-off at 300 Million Dollars, U. S. And in every major shot, from the trailers and in the final product, unfortunately, I can identify the subpar CGI, blatant green-screens and unconvincing body-doubles... It's unacceptable. There's a scuba diving sequence which isn't filmed underwater for instance. Take a VFX shot from any of the previous four movies, yes, even Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)... And I guarantee you, they'll be of a higher quality than what is presented here. Apparently, Disney's VFX Artists are underpaid, but I still can't wrap my head around those 300 Million Dollars... Where'd the money go? And who knew an Indiana Jones movie could look so ugly? It makes all those snide complaints about CGI prairie-dogs in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) seem redundant.Furthermore, The Dial of Destiny (2023) makes it abundantly clear how underrated Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is anyway. Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) is nowhere to be found, and declined to return around the same time Steven Spielberg bowed out. The film chalks-up Mutt's absence to an off-screen death whilst serving in Vietnam - also the root cause of Indy's alcoholism and break-up with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), believe it or not. The narrative through-line between the fourth and fifth movies just feels jarring as a result. We literally end Kingdom (2008) with a wedding and open The Dial of Destiny (2023) with a divorce..? I'm sorry, did I miss something? Could this same exact story have occurred with Mutt and Marion by Indy's side? Absolutely. What's with this trending creative urge to make old heroes depressed? It doesn't elevate any of the material here, and that's a shame, because Harrison Ford tries his best to accomodate the forced screenplay... What a waste. I guess the focus needs to be on Indy and his goddaughter, yet their relationship isn't particularly involving. Just conceptually even, it's a stretch. ""Goddaughter""? She might as well be his next-door neighbour.The climax is where I gave up. Indiana Jones travels back in time to 212 B. C and witnesses the Siege of Syracuse. The whole set-piece is ugly and overproduced. Sure, the finales of Indiana Jones movies have generally been outlandish... And yet, they remain tasteful. They're guided by Spielberg's direction and Lucas's imagination... I can't imagine they'd ever concoct something like this though. And they've been known to go wild, too... But you need to know how and why you're going wild. James Mangold has no clue, and thus crosses the line into pure, unadulterated nonsense. Aesthetically, none of these images can fit-in with the rest of the series... Antikythera is revealed to be a one-way time portal only... And yet, Indiana Jones begs Helena Shaw to leave him at this place and moment in time, inexplicably. Because what else could be waiting for him in 1969, after-all? He drinks in excess, his wife's left him and his son's died sometime after enlisting in Vietnam... Just to ""piss him off"", apparently. I could've sworn they overcame any hard feelings by the end of Kingdom (2008)... Anyway, Helena insists there's no reason for him to remain in 212 B. C either, and the audience agrees with her for all the wrong reasons. Helena shouldn't have to convince Indiana Jones, a scientist, first and foremost, of the potential ramifications in disturbing the space-time continuum. She shouldn't have to knock him out either. Again, a creative detour I'm sure Kathleen Kennedy had complete control over. Did nobody at Lucasfilm think to maybe oppose that gesture? Is Helena punching Indiana supposed to be funny, noble, selfish or heroic? I'm not sure. Neither was anyone behind the camera. Indiana Jones wakes up in his New York City apartment, where Marion Ravenwood returns bearing groceries. She'd been called over by Helena, a person she's never met in her life, to rekindle the ageing flame with her former spouse... Indy and Marion then reenact the scene from the ship in Raiders (1981), in what is potentially the most uncomfortable, nostalgia-pandering conclusion they could've gone for... Yikes.Lucas' and Spielberg's departures were the first red flag. The actual preamble didn't instil anybody with much hope either, especially after those woeful early reviews from Cannes... I was optimistic. I had to be. John Williams was gonna be scoring after-all. The soundtrack itself is nothing remarkable, and that's almost a positive commentary, when the film it's attached to is so mournful.","7/10"
"eprusulis","3 July 2023","So I thought the movie was going to be terrible specially, because the last one was OK but one prior was awful and I really didn't think this was gonna be that good of a movie because let's face facts Harrison Ford is getting old. Do you know if so, who wants to watch an 80 year old man running around when it doesn't look real. The actress that played Helena was unbelievable. She helped you move. Keep this moving in the right direction. I also saw Harrison Ford was a lot better than I thought it was gonna be like I mean I don't. I'm sure it was a lot of special effects but I don't even know because maybe he does well for the age , so I thought it was gonna look a little ridiculous with him almost like it the way they did everything it looks realistic but it also you know with him constantly talking about how he feels like he's dying made it also realistic like he was an all the sudden superman . The script of the movie was really good. All the collectors were really it had a really good cast from top to bottom. I wish Mary Ann was in the movie a little bit more instead of the cameo at the end right to be honest, I think she was with Andy instead of helana the movie when I'm done . By reading some of the reviews before I watched it and I should've realize they were going to do this. No, I was expecting my God movie I could barely finish glad I was wrong, and it was a good swan, a good goodbye to Indiana Jones. So may I say maybe a whole Lotta Helena Jones? Well, I don't know her last name, but I could see her doing the next one and the new archaeologists. I didn't have the typical Indiana Jones action and then there's a horse see where he's running through subways with a horse it was great.","6/10"
"ergo-58534","12 July 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a spectacular and thrilling sequel to the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

"erhanipekciler","4 January 2024","Well, seeing young Indiana Jones was very good. Technology is amazing, that makes every actor and actresses eternal! I love that! As a movie, you know ther care lots of unlogical things but this is Indiana Jones, who cares? I have to say Sicilia scenes, from beginning to end, just perfect! Full action is over there. I love also time travel section.. . Phoebe waller Bridge is sooo cool and so suitable for her role in this movie. I hope this series can continue in some way. Final is also so sweet. Seeing Marion was good. I love happy endings. Anyway I love everything about movie, technology, characters, scenes, places. If you are a fan of Indiana Jones, I am sure you will love this too.","3/10"
"eric262003","25 September 2018","The last of the the series of ""The Planet of the Apes"" titled ""The War of the Planet of the Apes"" sparked an abundance of positive reviews from the audience. The box office reached the plateau of over $134 million and people were just stunned at the outcome of how the series ended. To me this final installment was the best of the series and if a film wants to wrap up a series this is truly the way to do it.It's great to see Matt Reeves back again in the director's chair plus he has double the duty this time serving as co-writer along with Mike Bomback. It's great that Reeves returns that way we can easily have the series pick up where it left off from the previous installment, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"". In this movie we see the return of Caesar (Andy Serkis) getting his vengeance against the ruthless Colonel (Woody Harrelson) after the pain and heartbreak he caused to his family.Although the plot seems like a story that's been done hundreds of times, Reeves succeeds in taking the efforts to create newer, fresher ideas and avoiding using recycled cliches like other filmmakers do. The epic battle between Caesar and the Colonel has increased in levels of sheer intensity is likely to grab your attention. It's also a great way to side with the simians and truly has characters you could easily side with while having villains you could easily despise.Woody Harrelson is excellent as the villain in this story. From the opening scenes you truly hate this person and you hope that in the end he gets what's coming at him. Harrelson is amazingly versatile in all of his performances, but here he does outdo himself here. Don't expect to see any signs of his likable character on 'Cheers"" anytime.Great addition to the cast is Amiah Miller as the mute girl, Nova (similar traits her predecessor Linda Harrison portrayed in the ""Planet of the Apes"" film in the 1960's and 1970's). She's been caught with the simian epidemic making her almost primitive, but her expression and emotions truly make up for role in which she is mute throughout the whole film. Even though comedy is not a necessity in this movie, it does have some comic relief from Steve Zahn's performance as Bad Ape. At least it feels organic and not rubbed into our faces. It also helps that his backstory is quite provocative to make his character all the more likable.The story and the CGI are truly the cornerstones that make the franchise all the more enjoyable. And with the apes who are talking the CGI is in full swing making it all the more effective in its storytelling. Sure I'm more for practical stuff, but the CGI was used wisely and never catches you off guard. And sure their voices are not as on the levels as the human race or have the same types of weaponry as humans, but the film is so effective in its storytelling, you just forget that these simians are CGI. The special effects deserves award recognition come award season.And though the film can brag that the positives outweigh the negatives, there are still plenty of errors too as well. One of the guffaws includes the apes scoping the hideouts of the Colonel. Caesar is observing his nemesis through his binoculars. Luca (Terry Notary) Caesar's reliable ally. Luca asks in him in sign language if he sees the Colonel, but Caesar responds to him even though he isn't looking at Luca. There's others, but they don't hinder the movie that much.To say that this film ends the trilogy with a bang would be an understatement. But if they wish to make more films of this calibre 20th Century Fox can now take the liberties to create more stories along this route. With characters like Nova and Cornelius added to the franchise, this is the opening of potential prequels to the films that were made in the 1960's and 1970's. And though it is predictable, it still quenches your curiosity as to what will happen next. Of course this solidifies the trust we have in Matt Reeves as he'll be directing the next Batman film. Reeves did a great job in the last two films of this franchise as we look forward to his future projects.","1/10"
"Eric266","12 December 2023","It took me four separate viewings to get through this movie. It did get better, but its not a great movie by any means.The first 20 minutes are about as good as any other parts of the series. But then the next hour is grating. The dialogue is amateurish and the action scenes are so contrived its like they had several set pieces in mind and just needed to fill in gaps to get from one to the other. Lots has been written about the Helena character played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She annoyed me very much in the early parts of the film, which is why I kept turning it off. The last 45 minutes or so, her character tones down the annoyance factor and she's a decent addition. Had she played the character that way from the beginning, I think a lot of the hate would have been diffused. It wasn't a character arc. There was no situation that made her stop being annoying. She just stopped being annoying. Its like they wrote scenes for two separate characters, one who would be killed off, then changed their minds and combined the scenes/dialogue into one Helena character.During the iconic scenes of the red line crossing the map as they traveled the world, someone decided NOT to include the theme song. I mean, WTF!?Indiana Jones deserved a better send off than this. It wasn't terrible, maybe a bit too long and the direction was weak, but it still can't match the previous entries. It was missing the element of fun and adventure from previous entries and that is what really turned me off. It just didn't match the escapist tone of the earlier movies.","9/10"
"Eric266","4 June 2023","I finally watched this movie last night. I've read all the reviews and seen several YouTube videos bashing this movie, so I was not expecting much. Despite this, I was still quite entertained.Scott Lang is living his best life with his girlfriend, Hope, his daughter, Cassie, and father- and mother-in-law , Hank and Janet. Then his daughter inadvertently opens a portal to the quantum realm and all five are sucked into it. They find a realm that is teeming with an entire universe inhabited by diverse characters, including a cameoed Bill Murray. The inhabitants are fighting against a dictator, Kang, who wants to leave the quantum realm and take over our universe.This has all been done before, for better or worse, by Star Wars. Some of the characters are interesting and some even have decent scenes, but its a little too much CGI and not enough heart like the other Ant-man movies. That is my biggest issue with this. Ant-man is supposed to kind of palate cleanser for the darker elements of the MCU, but its darker than the previous two movies and it doesn't really feel like an Ant-man movie. There is a serious element of girl-power as well, but its done properly and feels organic, not forced, which was refreshing.This is a visually stunning movie and Kang is a decent villain, but he doesn't have the same menace as Thanos. Kang mostly just screams in anger as opposed to having that simmering anger and focus of purpose that inhabited Thanos.","7/10"
"ericgoldberg-50159","1 July 2023","This is a sequel that should have never been made. This is what Hollywood and especially Disney does. They make sequels just to make a quick buck and couldn't care less about good storytelling or even originality. Disney has sold out and now they've made Indiana Jones a sell out too. This movie is what an Indiana Jones movie should never be.... BORING. The only scene that really interested me is when Indy rides a horse through a 1960's subway. The plot is more worn out than Indy's hat. Harrison Ford said in interviews that this is officially the last one. If they do stupidly decide to make another one they can call it Indiana Jones and the Retirement Home.EDIT: The final scene is good but the build up to it is a complete letdown. This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst of all the Indiana Jones movies.","1/10"
"ericknromero","2 July 2023","I give it a 6 out of 10. Let me get the crud out of the way first so I can finish with the good stuff (spoiler free, don't worry).It feels like an imitation of an Indiana Jones movie rather than an Indiana Jones movie. As if someone was told what the character and films were about, described some of their favorite scenes from the earlier versions, and then had ChatGPT come up with a movie. What was created was an approximation. So you get similar, but not the same, stunts and jokes and treasures and chases and blending-in-to-hide moves and lucky-to-be-alive moments. They're just not as good, and certainly not as original.Some of the CGI isn't good enough, de-aging technology had mixed results, and, to me, the chase scenes through towns are kind of cringe. Through it all you're thinking ""There's no way a man in his 70s is doing all of that."" They throw in a couple of appearances from familiar characters, just so you can point at the screen and yell ""I know that person! They're from the other thing!""I suppose it's the execution that bothered me the most, then. This is a little surprising because I consider James Mangold a good director with an excellent track record when it comes to executing compex film ideas (or even simple ones). This is where I'll transition to what I liked about the Dial of Destiny.Story is super solid, Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones (no matter what age or movie), some of the character interactions appear genuine and moving, Mads Mikkelsen has never been anything short of magnificent in any of his roles, Phoebe Waller-Bridge is really good when the script let's her be, and that ending is one of the best endings I've seen in an Indy film. This may be a movie with a high level of rewatchability built in, so my change my mind in the future.Though a little too wacky for my taste, there is lots of comedy, action, and adventure. Having Ford reprise the title role one last time gives it a sense of believability, even when things pop off in a ridiculous way. Once again, that last part of the movie is made real for us because of how Indiana Jones reacts to it. And his interactions with his family/friends make it touching in just the right amount.Personally, I love the history aspect of these movies. In this one they get into topics like Syracuse and Archimedes from Ancient times, the 1969 moon landing and what American culture was like then, and, as per the usual, what those Nazis were up to during WW2. The clues and hunting and passageways with mystery around the corner, that's classic Indiana Jones and that's definitely here.I will say the trailer is misleading. Jones hasn't been looking for the Dial for all of his life. They make that abundantly clear in the beginning of the movie. He is looking for something else, maybe something he can't have... or maybe he can.","6/10"
"ericstevenson","30 April 2018","I'm just going to say right now that I don't believe this movie to be as good as the 2012 Avengers movie. It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike ""Transformers"" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****","2/10"
"ericstevenson","6 August 2017","This initially came off as too long of a movie for me, but it ended up being well worth the length. The best part is probably this great twist that's introduced that sets up a brand new mythology for the series. In this movie, it's revealed that some of the remaining humans are starting to lose the ability to talk, including this one girl whom the apes befriend. What happens is that the virus is apparently mutating and now the surviving humans are starting to lose their intelligence, reverting to ape like behavior themselves! The scene where the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) explains this is to Caesar is probably the best part in the movie.Koga was a great villain for the previous movie and it's great how we at least get him alluded to here. Even Caesar himself admits that he's starting to become like him, sincerely wanting to kill the Colonel. My only complaint is that there wasn't really a war of any kind here. It didn't have any more action than the previous installment. It was still very well written and they even explicitly mention ""Ape Shall Not Kill Ape"". Some apes do in fact work for the humans. I just wished there were more sympathetic humans here. ***1/2","1/10"
"erimerdi","4 September 2023","When the Dial of Destiny came out I read lots of negative comments also when a movie comes out I always check the box office openings and when I saw it ended up flopping I thought ok, they finally messed up a good thing too and I refused to go and see it in the movie theatre because I'm an Indiana Jones fan and I love the franchise. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie that I visit time to time and still enjoy watching it. Part of the reason is I didn't want to ruin the love and respect that I got for IJ franchise If the this last IJ movie did actually disrespect the franchise. Of Course, I knew I would watch it when it is on Demand. It has been a while since it came out and finally yesterday I watched it at home and I don't understand what's wrong with those people? They have been bashing the movie so hard even the fans got affected by them and for what?I think the movie is made more believable in many senses. An almost 80 years old Indiana acts like an old man who had his time and adventures in his prime. I don't see any problems in that. I would feel like cheated if Indiana moves and fights like he is in his 40s so at hos 80s he acts like he is an old man who still got spark in him. The movie also got all the classical elements of Indiana jones movies. There are always some supernatural elements blend in with good adventure and action. This is stil the case with the Dial of Destiny. Bottom line is I loved the movie I don't understand why there has been so much hate for this final IJ movie. I enjoyed watching it and I will visit it time to time in the future.","7/10"

And then another thing, which is really a mistake, is that Iron Man managed to crack his knuckles, yet with the Hulk to burst into life to use the gems he made a monstrous figure instead with Iron Man no And thenwhy use your own glove to him we have seen that Hulk managed to survive then why not use precisely regarding thor Wanda Doctor Strange and captain marvel and then the sacrifice of Iron Man for me is completely useless since the villains were all systematic at all the heroestherefore useless sacrifices then if some characters many a character had returned to fight So why didn't they return Black Widow is Iron Man a and I only live to also tell you that there are no moments after the credits there aren't any That is, this film could have meditated that face insteadwith these heroes it really made me feel bad.

"estebangonzalez10","26 December 2012","¨All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.¨This film reminded me of why I love movies so much. Even though it is very hard to come across these gems nowadays, once you finally discover one you completely fall in love with it and are reminded why you fell in love with movies in the first place: it is just such a magical and emotional experience. Life of Pi is among the 3 best films of 2012 and despite my dislike towards 3D movies in general, I loved its use here. The art direction, visual effects, and cinematography were astonishing; it was one of the most beautiful films I've seen. This is a film you will want to see in 3D and enjoy the experience as much as possible because in my opinion this is the best use in 3D that I've seen. Life of Pi is based on the successful novel written by Yann Martel which many considered impossible to adapt to the big screen, but Ang Lee found a way to do it yet again. Lee amazed me in 2000 with his wonderful Chinese film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He has always been a magician artistically speaking. He also did a wonderful job with the storytelling and cinematography in Brokeback Mountain, but in Life of Pi he directs his best and most complete film to date. I left the theater totally satisfied and amazed with the wonderful visual experience. I also enjoyed the performances and the storytelling; so I have nothing really negative to critique about Lee's work here. I also love climatic twist endings and this film has one of the best I've seen since The Sixth Sense. This is a masterpiece and a must see movie for all.A writer (Rafe Spall) has been sent by an acquaintance to visit a man named Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) who has a story to tell him that will make him believe in God. Pi receives the writer kindly and while he cooks for the man he begins to narrate his story. The writer is curious to find out what Pi has to tell him and he patiently listens to him as he narrates his story from the very beginning. He explains how he got his name, what his family was doing in India at the time, and so on. Of course none of this is really what the writer is expecting to hear until Pi gets to the heart of the story. He explains that his family owned a zoo and that his father suddenly decided to move them all to Canada. While they are all (including the animals) on their way to Canada on a carrier ship a heavy storm intercepts them and the ship sinks. Pi (the younger version played by Suraj Sharma) manages to survive along with a couple animals: an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Pi struggles to survive along with the animals in the small lifeboat in middle of the Pacific Ocean as he encounters many obstacles that will test his faith. The film is told in a similar fashion to Slumdog Millionaire (through flashbacks which happen to be longer than the present scenes) as we have the narrator telling his incredible story to the writer.Suraj Sharma is really great here as the main character. Incredibly he has had no prior experience as a film actor, but he singlehandedly delivers this movie considering he is in the boat almost the entire time on his own (the animals were added mostly through CGI). A lot of credit has to be given to the visual effects department considering the animals look so real and believable. This film is really beautiful to watch, everything about it is just wonderful, including the powerful climatic ending which had a great message. I thought the film worked as sort of a parable more than an actual metaphor. I haven't read the novel, but I really can't see how it can be better than the film. Lee's imagination works better than mine, and he has created a wonderful film with many memorable scenes that will stick with me forever. The film touches lightly on themes of religion and faith, but at the end it will make you think about it. Everyone can make their own conclusions as to what story they want to believe, but it was pretty clear for me as to where the director was trying to get as to how he viewed God. The less you know about the film before going into it, the better. The film does start a bit slow, but it was a nice setup in my opinion with some beautiful cinematography, and it just picks up from there. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","5/10"
"esthercross","22 July 2017","I personally struggled to stay motivated with this one. Whilst we should applaud the magician worthy skills of the CGI technicians, I found myself emotionally disconnected from the story and my eyes where craving that other 75 percent of the colour wheel by the end.Structurally I think it is always a rocky choice to put a fight scene at the very start of the film as even in the case of sequels we are not as emotionally invested in the outcome of the characters and you loose the important fight scene tension. I needed the person beside me to check my pulse for how little I felt for the opening battle. If we had seen some touching exchange between ape families with some heartfelt music I may have felt more about the outcome of the opening 15 minutes.Planet of the apes doesn't offer much in the way of relief from the dreary colours, angst and rain. The film doesn't have much of a sense of humour about it other then the token laugh an hour character 'bad ape' who was charming but not enough to save the film for me. I don't want to let it go by unmentioned though that I think Andy Serkis is Devine and endlessly watchable. I think that the sincerity within Caesars portrayal was mesmerising. It was almost a well crafted duet between Serkis and the breath taking capabilities of modern CGI.Unfortunately I'm gonna have to return to the small matter of me not enjoying the film. Another point I have to made is that I felt that the moments of tenderness where at times a little contrived. The film needed more poetry as a whole but the few attempts at a heartfelt scene for me where a little tenuous I don't wanna include spoilers but you might agree that the 'sad' scene with the 'reprised blossom behind the ear' didn't quite have the right foundation for actual poignancy.Right at the start of the film a drunk man arrived late and made his way to his front row seat across the front of the auditorium with his bottle of water held high in a victorious manner (perhaps he sneaked in) he continued to walk with vigour until he collided with the wall opposite. I know that the people I watched Planet of the Apes with also weren't particularly taken with the film because when we filed out the cinema the drunk man was the first and only thing my friends wanted to talk about.","9/10"
"etd380","11 January 2024","Highly recommended, Jason at his best again. Great fighting scenes, great revenge. Absolutely enjoyed it every single second of it. This movie is more like similar to John Wick. Outstanding performance from Jason's throughout the movie and hopefully, they make another movie of Jason's on the second chapter of the beekeeper 2. Jason's plays absolutely the best role in this action blockbuster. Jason should stick with more action movies rather than B grade movies. Solid performance from a good actor who deserves to win a movie award. One of the best Jason movie in a very long time. Hopefully, Jason will continues.","7/10"
"EthanBJones_03","19 July 2017","'WAR_FOR_THE_PLANET_OF_THE_APES' was_directed_by_Matt_Reeves_and stars Andy_Serkis, Woody_Harrelson_and_Karin_Konoval. ​Caesar (Andy_Serkis) and_his_apes_are_forced_into_a_deadly_conflict_with_an_army_of humans led_by_a_ruthless_colonel (Woody_Harrelson). After_the_apes_suffer unimaginable_losses, Caesar_wrestles_with_his_darker_instincts_and begins_his_own_mythic_quest_to_avenge_his_kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet.Let me start of by saying that if the action was the main reason you liked Rise and Dawn, this movie is not for you. It contains some well done action but it is a drama film first and foremost. If you accept the movie for that(and have watched Rise & Dawn), I imagine you will love this movie.Let's start with the story. War is a deep, dark, harrowing story about what humanity will do to save itself. That is a deep question for a movie about talking apes. It asks the audience if they would give up their humanity, to save humanity and that is powerful stuff. It is a genuinely harrowing question that I adore this movie for addressing. The ending for this movie is beautiful and poetic. It is the perfect end to a great trilogy. I will not spoil the ending but just know it is a very emotional experience that combines the harrowing questions of what is humanity with the spectacular buildup coming off Rise and Dawn. The writers of this trilogy could literally just have dumb plots that give us an excuse for apes to fight. They COULD do that but they don't. Each movie has given us a great, thought provoking story and making it the primary focus for this movie was a dangerous risk which I am pleased to say payed off. The overarching arc for this trilogy story wise has been excellent and is very rewarding for people who see the movies one after each other. I have NO complains with the plot and script for this movie; it is excellent.One more note on the dialogue. There is a chilling monologue from Woody Harrellson near the midpoint of the movie. It serves as an exposition dump, which is annoying, but the way they handled it makes me not care in the slightest. I got goosebumps on my arms from the writing of that one scene(you'll know it when you see it) and that is something I must praise the stellar crew behind this movie for.I've said it once, I've said it twice. I'll say it one last time, Academy. Give Andy Serkis a god damn Oscar. He deserves it! His performance throughout these movies is realistic in portraying an ape, and also a brilliant achievement in making an ape show emotion. Serkis has proved his worth multiple times and it is about time we show him he is appreciated. As much as I loved Hugh Jackman in 'Logan', Serkis deserves the Oscar. And unless something else comes out this year which sways my opinion, I will stand by it.My, and pretty much everyone,'s primary criticism with Rise and Dawn was the exceptionally weak human characters. This film changed that. Woody Harrellson gives a powerhouse performance as The Colonel and made him a terrifying villain. I don't quite agree he was better than Koba(Toby Kobell) but Koba had more time to develop and I think that was the reason he has the edge. I've mentioned the brilliance in the writing that made that monologue great but it was also Harrelson's performance. He gave me the chills and that is impressive. The most scary thing about The Colonel, however, is, well two things but they go hand in hand, the fact he remains nameless, and the fact I understand his point of view. Not giving him a name makes him more scary because it means that it could be any one person. It doesn't blame someone specific and it implies that anyone could become him given the circumstances. Giving him understandable motives also relates to this because it genuinely makes me question my own morality and humanity and makes me think what I would do in the situation he was in. It is rare a movie villain can do that and I truly applaud the film for that. The Colonel's end was also fitting and expertly handled.Karin Konoval has been consistently good throughout the entire trilogy. Steve Zahn's Bad Ape had the unfortunate job of the comic relief. He had to be funny and stupid but not to the point where he was annoying and obnoxious. And Zahn pulled this off expertly. I never disliked Bad Ape and consistently found him funny. He was a welcome addition to the film.The cinematography for this movie is breathtaking. I was gobsmacked for one very specific sequence in this movie towards the end, purely because of how beautifully it was shot and edited. The entire trilogy has been consistently impressive to look at cinematography wise but this film takes the icing on the cake in that department.If this franchise is robbed of ONE MORE best visual effects Oscar, I will lose my mind. The fact that the visual effects team can transform human being into living, breathing apes need to be commended. It is visually stunning and the CGI is flawless. This is a technical marvel on the same level as The Jungle Book. Yeah, I went there.All in all, War for the Planet of the Apes is a change of pace from the previous two installments but that does not mean it holds any punches. The minuscule amount of action used was great but I'm glad they committed to a drama story. If you accept this film as a drama, not action film; you will love it a lot more. And if you haven't seen Rise or Dawn, watch them before this movie. You will get the most enjoyment possible that way. I'll rate this movie a flawless 10 BAD APES out of 10!","10/10"
"ethanbresnett","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a relatively unambitious film that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or push the boat out too much. It all feels very derivative of the genre with no element of it particularly standing out.If you manage to wade through the tiresome bee metaphors, the clunky cliche dialogue, and Jason Statham's sporadic attempt at an American accent, there are some entertaining action set pieces to get stuck into.I do also think that the plot is perfectly decent. Nothing special but it moves along at a decent pace even if it is entirely ridiculous.Overall the Beekeeper is far from being a great, or even really a good film. But on the plus side it's not god awful. It's one of those films that has a time and a place, so if you are in the mood for some mindless action it will scratch that itch for you.","8/10"
"ethanbresnett","18 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is fine. It's nowhere near Marvel's best but it just about holds its own.Mostly this is because of Jonathan Majors, who is up there with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger as one of Marvel's finest antagonists. His performance is chillingly clinical and powerful. I don't think pitting him against Ant-Man is the best pairing however. The humour that goes hand in hand with Scott Lang contrasts the seriousness of Kang a little too starkly for my liking. I would have liked to have seen him up against a more serious Avenger.The rest of the performances are all good. Paul Rudd brings his charm to Scott Lang as ever. Kathryn Newton is a nice addition to the Marvel family, although I do think the chemistry between the two is a little weak.Where this film really gets let down is the story. Dare I say it I got a little bored. It just feels quite simple and underwhelming. The writing isn't great which doesn't help. The humour didn't really land for me either.It does boast some enjoyable visuals, with plenty of colour and vibrancy.I can't help but feel at this point that Marvel just needs to slow down. There is just so much Marvel content being pumped out that the action sequences, story lines, even the jokes, are just becoming far too formulaic and phoned in. When these films were coming out once, maybe twice a year that was more forgivable, but with 3 or more films and several TV shows each year the Marvel formula is getting a little tiresome. As a result I can't help but feel that Ant-Man is a victim of Marvel's success, resulting in a lacklustre and ultimately forgettable yet enjoyable film.","7/10"
"ethanbresnett","2 July 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is such a complete sequel and a more than worthy successor to Into the Spider-Verse.Visually it is such a stunningly rich film, full of vibrancy and creativity. The different worlds are individually crafted to feel unique which makes the film that much more absorbing. The various animation and artistic styles that are used really bring the characters and situations to life. The uses of colour are intriguing and tell a story all on their own. Visually this film is just a real treat.But that's not to say this film is style over substance, because the story is strong throughout. It has pace and drive that really propels things forward, and for such a far reaching story it is handled really well. It never feels like it is overreaching or too padded out, and the runtime breezes by.Another string to its bow is its balance of humour and drama. Lately a lot of superhero films try to be both funny and serious, and the humour ends up undercutting the drama and emotion of the story. Spider-Verse manages to do both exceedingly well. It is a funny film that also packs some powerful emotional and dramatic punches, balancing these two tones very well.To top it all off, the film has a terrific score that further heightens all of the visual and narrative themes to make for a very complete and well rounded film.Just a terrific experience all around!","10/10"
"ethiotst-53110","5 June 2023","Greatest animated film is not a title I would give out lightly. It is up against some amazing films, like Wall-E, Toy Story, How to train your dragon 2, Up (pretty much most pixar movies). But Across the Spiderverse easily beats those films, something I never thought I would say.Animation/art style.The strongest part of this film is the animation. Every shot is this beautiful frame with so much going on. The comic book style animation just like the first film is excellently utilised. It is simply one of the most cinematic movies, and such a beautiful film, it really proves that animated films can be just as good as live action and not ""just for kids"".Story.Can't say too much without spoiling the movie but the story is super intriguing and explores some very interesting themes that the first film introduced but didn't really tackle all that much. It creates quite an emotional ride at times and the 'problem' that drives the plot forward is a really good one and simple yet unique idea even if it is introduced well into the movie.Characters.The characters are really developed past the funny bit that introduces the characters in the first film. Gwen's backstory is explored giving us more emotional investment in the film. Miles is funny and cool as ever, keeping his slight awkwardness.One of the antagonist (if you can really call him one) has a very justified motive that most people would agree with, all but Miles, this is why you can't really call him a bad guy per se.The true antagonist gas a really cool design, costume and character wise, his backstop is goofy and his introduction is too but he evolves throughout the film into this really cool villain.Side characters are interesting especially one of them that is all about going against the establishment.Background characters were honestly one of this movies strengths, there were so many characters that showed up even for a second or two that made me gasp and gave me a huge grin, don't want spoil any as part of the enjoyment from this film are the different spidermen you meet.","2/10"
"eugabrieldacosta","19 January 2024","The movie, at times, loses itself in secondary plots, diverting us from what truly matters - the action led by the hero. This leaves us eager for the central character's return.Though the story echoes films like John Wick, it fails to capture the same striking essence. It resides in predictability, unable to secure a place in cinematic memory.The action scenes are good but not exceptional. The actors shine in fights, yet the excitement falls short of expectations.Overall, it's an action film that oscillates between captivating and monotonous moments. The first act is promising, the second disappoints, while the third redeems some of the lost brilliance.","8/10"
"EUyeshima","16 December 2012","Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain""). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (""Howl's Moving Castle""). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.Adapted by David Magee (""Finding Neverland""), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' ""Cast Away"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan (""The Namesake"") plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from ""The Namesake"", Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and Gérard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall (""One Day"") plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward.","7/10"

"evansjoshyr","19 February 2023","Quantimania is a strange a little movie. It tries to be an adventure movie, an Ant-Man movie and almost an avenger movie of sorts. There are far better adventure movies and the first Ant-Man has a more personal, funny and cute story. But it does succeed at being an entertaining watch in a couple of ways.Kang is the obvious highlight. Everyone knows it. The acting performance was amazing. He was intimidating and interesting. He was a scene stealer and is completely worth seeing the movie for. My only complaint is that the movie made him an Ant-Man level threat instead of an avenger level threat, which seems strange and unrealistic.Other strengths include good visuals, little bits of typical MCU humor (that don't undermine the kang threat imo) which occasionally made me smile and some enjoyable but basic character development between Ant-Man and his daughter.It's not the best or worst marvel movie. It's just a fine, standard superhero movie that happens to star the new large MCU villain. Can't wait to see more Kang.","6/10"

They are such a spectacle to behold, pushing the boundaries of animation with every frame, but never forgetting to provide an engaging story with so much depth and heart to every character.Across the spiderverse is bigger and bolder than the previous entry. There is so much fan service and so much happening at once it can be hard to keep track of it on a first viewing. It wasn't until a second viewing that I began to appreciate and respect the care and love that went into every scene of this movie. It had an unpredictable story and ended in a way that will make you wish beyond the spiderverse was here right now. These movies are modern masterpieces and we are lucky to be able to witness them spectacularly unfold.","10/10"
"evanston_dad","15 February 2013","I read ""Life of Pi"" years ago and remembered little of the details about the book other than that I enjoyed it. During the first half hour or so of Ang Lee's screen adaptation, I felt myself getting bored and restless. It seemed like a religious movie, a movie whose central premise was all about reaffirming a belief in God. As a non-believer, I don't begrudge films with religious themes, but I also don't really enjoy them, feeling like someone invited to a party where everyone else is speaking a different language.But then the main thrust of the story kicks in, the young boy Pi is stranded in the middle of the ocean with a lifeboat and a tiger, and I was engrossed by the beauty and spectacle that Ang Lee delivers. And then toward the end, there's a twist that I instantly remembered from the book as soon as it happens in the film, and that I can't believe I had forgotten. For that twist is what makes this film something beautiful and much more than a simple story about faith in a higher power. Instead, it becomes a story that gets much closer to the motives behind what I think drives most people to religious faith, and that is that believing in God is way more comforting than the alternative. Some people seem to be able to choose to believe, while others (like myself) simply can't, no matter how much more appealing life seems with a strong belief in a higher power. People will argue probably forever over this film's ending and what it means, but that's what it meant for me.Ang Lee needs to be commended. This film had to be a very difficult directing feat to pull off, confined as it is almost entirely to a lifeboat and a slew of CGI effects.A truly wondrous and wonderful film.Grade: A","1/10"

Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is menacing and terrific, he brings many layers to his character, and this is pivotal seeing as he's Marvel's next big bad. Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer also excel in their roles. The visuals are also well-done.The biggest issue with this movie is the plot. The characters don't develop, it's just like a singular occurrence at the end, like a bad dream, and nothing is produced from it save the conglomeration of Kangs.

"eyecandyforu","25 November 2012","Life of Pi is an amazing allegory, that attempts to explain a very abstract concept. This will no doubt confuse many, because it touches on the heart of how we perceive our own spiritual beliefs, it challenges our ideas of religion, the things we have held onto since childhood to give us hope and inspiration. Many people will leave the theater thrilled by a story of a boy who is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger and how they formed a bond that saved them both. The film is vividly colorful, exciting and haunting, masterfully directed by Ang Lee. But, just as we think we've had a rollicking good time with a fantastical story, the last part of the film comes at us, and shakes us up. This is the crucial part of the film, and if audiences choose to ignore this, they miss the entire message of the film. As Jung said ""Man must have his myths"". So it is with God, so it is with Life of Pi.","6/10"

Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never.Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad.

Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.I can't wait for Avengers 4.","5/10"
"facebook-383-422257","16 July 2017","I can count on the fingers of one hand the times I've walked out of a movie theater halfway through a movie. My attempt at watching ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is the third such occasion. And to think I had such high hopes! I can only conclude that everyone who rated the movie here, and all raving reviewers, saw a different cut, or more probably, an entirely different movie.Admittedly, ""War"" is is technically perfect, with awe-inspiring CGI, entirely convincing apes, and spectacular fight and battle scenes. If all a movie needed were good visuals and spectacle, ""War"" would deserve a 10, no discussion.But a good movie needs a convincing plot as well; believable characters with character development and relatable emotions; in short, good writing. And in that sense, this movie furthers the worrying trend of ignoring the need for content in favor of form.It starts in the opening sequence. A battle without a clear point or any reason to care about it, with its own annoying set of logic flaws, is followed by an interrogation scene. In this scene, the characters indulge in shameless exposition, the POWs spilling their beans without hesitation so that the viewer understands what it was all about. This bit actually made me squirm with vicarious embarrassment: lazy plotting and lazy writing taken to a whole new level. (A doomed attempt is made by the sound track composer to enhance this scene with music, but the score is empathic to the point of overbearing, a distraction and an annoyance.)The laziness of both the writers and the directors is also painfully apparent in every single chase and reconnoitering scene. On one occasion, an entire human army travels over a wide-open beach. The ape heroes chase the army, all four of them, on horseback, about a quarter- mile behind the last vehicle, and in plain view. A little later in the movie, they spy on the army's encampment, again up close and in plain view. And what to think of the time they sneak up on a compound, one of the apes says he believes this to be the army's base, and they simply ride in anyway? (Again, to the accompaniment of overbearing music.)SPOILER ALERT: And that particular scene gets worse once they establish that the compound is deserted. They encounter a single human, who despite the odds against him, and the two automatic rifles aimed at him, attempts to draw, and is gunned down. Immediately after, the apes find a little girl, and befriend her without apparent effort, even convincing her to come with them. The fact that they make her walk past the warm corpse of what can only be her dad is compensated, apparently, by the fact that the orangutan hands her a stuffed animals she's half a dozen years too old for. (Cue the overbearing violins.)This is but one example of how emotional development, interactions, and character arcs seem tacked on, unconvincing, fundamentally flawed. It's like the makers thought it sufficient to telegraph emotional development in established movie shorthand: look, here's the dead child, so now the dad is heartbroken and wants revenge! Look, the scary gorilla who killed her dad picked a flower for her, so now the girl will cry her heart out when the ape dies! (To the overbearing sound of an entire orchestra.)The low point in this lazy, unconvincing shorthand is the way the humans are depicted as the worst evil imaginable. Look, not only do they kill apes, they execute their own handicapped, and torture the apes they capture! This is made worse by the fact that in the first hour--the bit I saw--the only point of view is the apes', so the viewer doesn't even get to experience first-hand how and why these atrocities are committed. Maybe the writers thought this would make the horror and evil more believable; the opposite is true. And did I mention the overbearing music?I walked out on ""The man in the iron mask"" because I could not stand the cinematography and nonsense plot line. ""Babel"" made me physically ill. ""War"" is now the third movie I've abandoned. A waste of an hour of my life, a waste of ten of my euros.","1/10"
"fallyhag","10 February 2024","I went into this film, knowing the actor and knowing what he typically does. All my predictions were correct, this was a lazy story with average CGI and amateur acting.I try to reason with myself explaining that this is a brain switch off film and I should just enjoy the entertainment. However, the story is so painfully bad that I just keep screaming all the way along as it progresses to a ridiculously stupid and nonsensical ending.I did like that the film was addressing the theme of the scammers on the Internet, but was disappointed to see that it glorified the call centres, making them high-tech, exciting and energy driven, rather than the dirty poverty rubbish centres run by desperate people.The action was cliche, and the CGI was absolutely awful in some places. The violence was as expected, and Jason Statham did what he always does, together with his ridiculous voice. Don't get me wrong I like him as an actor, but this was just a very lazy pay cheque.The climax was so poor you literally have to switch your brain off and forget who and where he is going to because if you start to think too much about the details, you will just simply switch off the television and go and paint the garden fence. And don't get me started on the cliche villain who came out of nowhere at the end to help create the bad ass fight scene which wasn't really needed.If you like a lazy film with little to no thinking required, then this one is for you. It will no doubt do well in the box office, then it will join the Z list of ridiculous movies on the bottom shelf.Not recommended. Because it was so lazy!","4/10"
"fanofxc","4 February 2024","This action move has a soul because you are pulling for the bad guy to go down. Who takes money from an educator. It's non stop action after ten minutes. Lots of big names and a few from the past. Lots of fight scenes. Many of them are graphic. If you love action and fight scenes you'll love this movie.the Beekeeper is one of those movies that should age well. I will love for it again once it hits video. It was nice to see Minnie Driver in a very nice cameo. I think most people can relate to the scammers out there and this should resonate with everyone. Who knew Beekeepers were so violent. Go see it.","5/10"
"fcabanski","18 October 2017","The original Planet of The Apes movies were social commentaries. In them, the ape society mirrored human society, and there were good apes and bad apes. Watching those movies, you could see both the good and bad in people and apes, standing in for people.But the re-boot series of movies changes the social commentary - America bad, terrorists good.It's no accident or coincidence that the apes seek to travel to the desert where they will be free of the evil Americans who want the apes dead. After all, Hollyweirdos think the mad Muslim terrorists just want to be left alone, and they're fighting for their freedom against evil America.History shows that's not true, but Hollyweird leftists don't care much for real history.Early in the movie, the evil American colonel kills Caesar's wife and son. That's evil! It's portrayed as evil. Not long after that, Caesar kills a little girl's father. He never expresses a moment of sorrow. He never questions his own actions, even in light of just living through someone killing his family. But he's good.Get it? Desert people who use guerrilla tactics to fight the evil Americans - aka mad Muslim terrorists - are good. Americans who use military tactics to fight for their survival are evil.That's the movie in a nut shell. That message is wrapped in absurd battle scenes with apes fighting off well armed soldiers - rocket launchers, body armor, night vision goggles, instant radio communication - with the apes using home made smoke bombs, spears, and a few modern weapons.Ther's no ape violating ""ape must not kill ape"" in this movie. That was gone in the second reboot movie. There's only the warped message - America bad, desert dwelling terrorists good.","2/10"
"fcabanski","20 October 2018","The writing was on the wall with an early fight between Thanos and Hulk. OK, Thanos is all powerful, but he beats Hulk with a few punches and knees. At least make the fight big.The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.","10/10"

"FeastMode","12 January 2024","I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)","3/10"
"FeastMode","17 February 2023","I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart (and crazy) like me and don't watch trailers. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not joining the MCU doom and gloom crowd. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe.(3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023, IMAX 2/28/2023, 10/5/2023)","6/10"
"FeastMode","2 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete.

"febru3012","2 May 2013","Taking big risks with big payoffs in directing, writing, production and casting were reasons enough for this movie to have won the Oscar for best movie. The story is tight and keeps you focused as no other movie I've seen in years. This movie breaks ground as it doesn't reprocess any story lines like there were in other movies that were in Oscar contention. Because this movie is unique I have to admit it took me a good half hour to get into the swing of what was going on. That is good since this movie takes you places you've never been and completely entertains you while doing so. This is what original movie making is all about. This is a must see movie.","10/10"

It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War.
In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who.
The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds.
The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting.

"ferguson-6","11 July 2017","Greetings again from the darkness. Counting the original in 1968, this is the ninth Planet of the Apes film (sourced from the Pierre Boulle novel), and the third in the most recent reimagining – including Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). That's almost 50 years of talking apes questioning the role, purpose and intent of humans. Director Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) is back after 'Dawn' and clearly has an affinity for the characters and the continuing saga. This one is by far the most personal  if that's the right term when applied to a species other than persons! Opening with the film's best battle scene (and perhaps the most superb and vivid of the franchise); the film stuns us with the realism of apes on horseback and searing violence that rivals any war film. We are immediately drawn in by the thrilling and intimate battle scenes, and the accompanying adrenaline rush. It's a beautiful and heart-pounding opening that will surely satisfy even the most demanding action-oriented fans. This is also when we notice that Michael Giacchino's score as a complementary thing of beauty and not just more over-the-top action film music bravado.The great Andy Serkis returns as Caesar, the leader of the apes, and dare I say, one of the most exciting and dynamic recurring characters in the movie universe. This third film belongs to Caesar and we see his intelligence, personality and skills have evolved in each. His human nemesis this time is Woody Harrelson in Colonel Kurtz psycho-war lord mode. In the years since ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", a simian virus has wiped out much of the human race and now the last two human factions (one led by Harrelson) are preparing for a final epic war, while at the same time, all remaining humans are united against apes.Apes simply want to be left alone in the forest, but humans focused on their destruction are forcing the apes to fight. One particular attack causes Caesar to erupt in anger and strive for revenge, providing the foundation for a movie with less action than the previous two, and a more concerted focus on story and character. Some may be disappointed in this. Others (like me) will find it fascinating.Joining Serkis/Caesar for a third round are Terry Notary as Rocket and Karin Konoval as Maurice (orangutan). Also returning is Toby Kebbel as Koba – this time in a manner that really messes with Caesar's mind. Steve Zahn steals his scenes as the comedy relief chimp known only as ""bad ape"", with Judy Greer as Cornelia, and young Amiah Miller as Nova (same name as Linda Harrison in the original). Nova is a human girl who seems to fit much more with the apes than the warmongering humans. Fans of the original will also note Caesar's son is named Cornelius (the same as Roddy McDowell's ape in the original). Director Reeves delivers what would be a fitting end to a trilogy, but there is likely to be yet another if fans can appreciate that the series has evolved every bit as much as the apes.","10/10"
"ferguson-6","26 November 2012","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we are reminded of just how stunning movies can be. Periodically a filmmaker proves to us that pushing the envelope of creativity still drives some auteurs. James Cameron brought us Avatar, which demonstrated that 3D technology could be beautiful and breath-taking. As beautiful and new as Cameron's breakthrough was, it lacked a story worthy of it advancements. Now, we get director Ang Lee's vision of Yann Martel's worldwide bestseller, and we are left gasping at what happens when you combine a fantastical story with technological advances and perfection.Ang Lee has provided us with a varied selection of films including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain; and Sense and Sensibility. He refuses to be limited by genre and takes a global and philosophical view of filmmaking. He wants us to think and discuss and think some more. His Life of Pi film purposefully leaves many scenes, events and thoughts open to interpretation. You can see as much or as little of humanity in this story as you like.The brilliant opening shows real animals in the real zoo located in Pondicherry, India. The colors, sights and sounds are dazzling and give us an immediate feel for the area. We meet young Pi and his family. Pi is inquisitive and ingenious from an early age. His father imparts such wisdom as ""If you believe in everything, you believe in nothing"". This comes as Pi is absorbing multiple religions and considers himself Hindu/Muslim/Christian. At an early age, he seeks answers and meaning. Soon enough, Pi and his family take their most valued animals on a ship to Canada. Disaster strikes when a storm capsizes the ship and Pi is the lone human survivor. He finds himself in a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a huge Bengal tiger.The developments need not be discussed here, but rather the focus of the story is the spirit of survival that Pi possesses. His ingenious methods of learning to coexist with the ferocious tiger force us to consider what the human race has done to nature in too many regards to count. Pi's religious spirit and insightful ways, coupled with a very specific survival guide, lead him to maneuver 227 days adrift in the Pacific. In the process, we are treated to some of the most spectacular visuals ever seen on screen. At times the sea, and its sea life and sky, are phosphorescent. The story is so amazing that we find ourselves not caring how much is real and how much is caused by Pi's hunger and thirst. Some of the visual effects are tranquil, while others are quite violent. A sequence featuring flying silver fish is something to behold.The structure of the story is such that an adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is re-telling the tale of survival to a Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). While this is a traditional story-telling device, it takes nothing away from the anything but traditional story of Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's name). We are told ""This is a story that will make you believe in God"". Whether it does or it doesn't, it certainly makes us believe in the magic of movies.Some will compare to Castaway, while others will think of 127 Hours. My best advice is to let go and give yourself to the story and the film. There is always time afterwards for debate and discussion. Instead, enjoy the moment and be thankful that a movie like this can get made ... it will lead the industry to even more creative productions down the road. So, just this once, forget what I have said many times, and go see this one in 3D. Allow it to take you away.","10/10"
"ferguson-6","29 June 2023","Greetings again from the darkness. ""They look like snakes."" It's such a simple line of dialogue, yet after 42 years and four previous movies, we know exactly what that means to retiring archaeology professor, Dr. Henry Jones, best known to all as the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. As the final chapter of the beloved franchise, this entry is the first one not directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg (listed here as an Executive Producer). Instead, James Mangold takes the reins, and also shares writing credit with his frequent collaborators Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth, as well as ""Indiana Jones"" veteran David Koepp. Of course, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman receive credit for their original characters.Harrison Ford once again dons the familiar whip and hat, and at 80 years of age, still possesses the screen persona and magnetism that first won us over in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The extended and frenetic opening sequence finds a young Indy (Ford is digitally de-aged for the sequence) at the tail end of WWII fighting Nazis over what else, a prized ancient artifact. I'll leave the specifics to those who watch the film, but just know that it's an interesting historical choice, and also one that matters little in relation to the enjoyment of the film.Working alongside Indy in the opening sequence is his pal and fellow archaeologist, Basil Shaw (talented character actor Toby Jones, who seems to be in most movies these days). However, the fun part for me is seeing Thomas Kretschmann and Mads Mikkelsen share scenes as Nazi Colonel Weber and Dr. Voller, respectively. These are two of my favorite actors and I do wish they had a couple more exchanges ... although Mikkelsen's character gets significant screen time and plays a crucial role in how the story unfolds and concludes (he is also digitally de-aged for the opening sequence).The story picks up with modern day Dr Voller and his band of misfits tracking down the relic and disturbing Dr. Jones' retirement party. It's at this point where Indy's Goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pops up creating a three-way battle for the priceless relic. This sets off a chain of events that leads them on a global trek to desert, sea, and hallowed cities of antiquity. Helena's partner in crime is young Teddy (Ethann Isidore, sporting a Bob Griese Dolphins jersey), who is clearly the scrappiest of the bunch. Dr Voller's troupe includes Shaunetta Renee Wilson as the misguided Mason, Brad Holbrook as sleazy Klaber, and Olivier Richters as one of the largest bodyguards you've ever seen.Fans of the franchise know that the story is secondary to the characters and action, and there is no shortage of action on speeding trains, galloping horses, motorcycles, tuk tuks, vintage airplanes, and scuba dives. Antonio Banderas shows up as a boat-owning old friend of Indy, but it's the appearance of series favorites John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, and Karen Allen as Marion, that generated cheers from the audience. Ms. Waller-Bridge holds her own with screen legend Ford, and it will be interesting to see the career path she chooses after her success on TV and now film. At times this feels like a live action cartoon, and that's not meant as criticism. It's pure fun, fantasy, and adventure cloaked in nostalgia; and the film is a fitting conclusion to a world class franchise.Opens in theaters June 30, 2023.","8/10"
"ferguson-6","9 February 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. For those who take pride in their ability to keep track of body counts in movies, I can only say, best of luck with this one. Boom. Bang. Punch. Kick. Stab. Choke. Flip. Our hero, acting alone, uses every available attack to neutralize armies, SWAT teams, trained security teams, and greedy scumbags ... all in the name of ""protecting the hive"". OK, it's mostly for revenge for causing the death of ""the only person who took care of me.""
Director David Ayer (END OF WATCH 2012, SUICIDE SQUAD 2016) and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (SALT, 2010) are very much at home in the action-violence genre, and adding the king of cinematic hand-to-hand combat, Jason Statham, to the mix can only mean more action and more fighting and more violence. There is no reason to critique a movie that delivers exactly what it sets out to deliver to an audience that expects exactly that.Statham is in prime form as Adam Clay, a beekeeper on a farm owned by retired teacher Elise Parker (Phylicia Rashad, CREED). When a phishing scam drains her bank accounts, including that of the non-profit she administers, Clay reacts to the subsequent tragedy by tracking down the culprits of the scheme. Tech fraudsters are easy targets because we all despise them, and the film plays that up by exaggerating the obnoxious nature of those involved. A miscast Josh Hutcherson (THE HUNGER GAMES) plays Derek Danforth, an entitled little bleep who skateboards in the office to his next massage and wears outlandish outfits befitting a person desperate for attention. Adding to the psychological drama is FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman, ""The Umbrella Academy""), the daughter of Elise, the woman who put Clay on his mission of reckoning.Additional supporting roles include Bobby Naderi as Verona's FBI partner, Jemma Redgrave as the President, a brief appearance by Minnie Driver as the FBI director (she takes three quick phone calls), and Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Wallace Westwyld, the retired agent charged with keeping Derek safe. The hook here is that beekeeper Clay is actually a retired secret agent known as ""the Beekeeper"", and in one of the oddest sequences, his replacement (a wild character inspired by Prince?) brings a Gatling gun to try and end Clay once and for all. The film is silly and absurd, and right up the alley of those who embrace Statham's stoic bulldozer of a man.","7/10"
"fernandoschiavi","13 January 2024","The film is set in the early 1970s, a time of diverse cultural changes in the USA and around the world. Indy (Ford) is a university professor about to retire and feels the transformations that are happening firsthand. It's as if the world no longer had room for a man who lived like him, and for his knowledge. In this context, Helena, the protagonist's goddaughter, appears, who sets him on a new adventure in search of a powerful artifact. From this context, director James Mangold (Logan, Ford vs. Ferrari) makes a constant play between past and future, tradition and modernity, in a clear nod to those who have followed the adventures of Indiana Jones over the decades and, perhaps like him, feel like you have lost space in the world. It's as if the film were a ""safe place"", delivering a classic archaeologist adventure, full of trips to different countries, escapes from impossible places and, of course, a lot of beating up Nazis. Such a choice can make ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" sound repetitive at certain times, but it is also possible to see all of this as a great tribute, taking into account that this film should mark the character's farewell - at least until Disney change your mind. Fortunately, although he focuses heavily on scenes that mirror Indy's already known adventures, Mangold doesn't weigh in on nostalgia and focuses more on the aforementioned generational conflict, sometimes even in a visual way. In a certain scene, for example, Indiana uses a horse to escape, while her tormentor uses a motorcycle to try to overcome her speed. It's the old debate between what's worth more in society: the breath of youth or the experience of older people.Time, as a recurring theme in the film, which opens with a sequence of flashbacks that serves as an introduction to both the villain and Antikythera. Soon after, we are taken to 1969, where we see Indy, out of time, at his retirement party, where he receives a watch. The archaeologist's dissatisfaction with the direction of the world is clear, wars (which even took away his son), high government spending on futile things (trip to the Moon) and people's lack of interest in history (the class he teaches is not dedicated to your class). This way, when he sees the possibility of returning to a time that he considers better, through Antikythera Indy, even if he doesn't admit it, he becomes a little happier. The same happens with his antagonist, the difference is that Voller does not hide his desire to remain in the past. The course of the plot ends up taking the characters to Antiquity, and the adventurer chooses not to return to the present time, but is stopped by Helena. Finally, through this, Indy realizes that it is not possible to stop time, and the character learns to value his present and the people around him, whether they are old companions or new friends. The great achievement of James Mangold's film is to prove that not even the great Indiana Jones is capable of beating time.Returning to the opening scene, the young version of Indy, created by computer graphics, completely clashes with the film and could easily be discarded, even occupying the first twenty minutes of the production. In moving parts, for example, it is clear that we are seeing a digital Indiana Jones, who even tries to repeat Harrison Ford's mannerisms, but never really gets there. While the facial rejuvenation technique isn't as bothersome in the close-up scenes on Ford's face, as strange as it may sound, at other times the sensation is different. The best example of this are the scenes on top of the train cars, in which Indy's digital doll runs over the top of the cars and then in the fight with the Nazis, fooling absolutely no one. In addition to the movement and choreography being conceived and executed without any inventiveness, the CGI with the movement of the train and the landscape on the sides is embarrassing. Disney has often invested in showing hyper-realistic digital versions of its characters, but in this film, it is very clear that you can even replicate the appearance of a star like Ford, but you will never be able to recreate a real talent. What's more: is it really necessary to rejuvenate an actor who is still active, just to put several action sequences in an unnecessary flashback? It's as if the studio itself was against the film's argument, indicating that youth will always have more space than experience.In this sense, Ford once again demonstrates his deep understanding of the character, whose tiredness gives way to excitement as soon as someone shows interest in what is being said by the professor, making it clear how his passion for archeology remains intact beneath his exhausted posture. Likewise, Indy remains human and believable even in the most absurd situations thanks to the way the actor exposes the protagonist's fear (more: panic) in several of them. On the other hand, the presence of John Rhys-Davies as Sallah never escapes pure fan service, not being justified by the plot or by any opportunity to create a memorable moment for the character. And if Phoebe Waller-Bridge presents herself as an interesting addition to the series (as much as the script always tries to make her a female version of Indiana Jones, as a woman with practically genius intelligence and free of defects and who also has a hard time making up her mind whether he will treat her as an ally of the protagonist or not), young Ethann Isidore never manages to transform Teddy into anything more than a faded echo of the Short Round played by Ke Huy Quan in ""The Temple of Doom"", being absolutely disposable for the narrative. To top it all off, Mads Mikkelsen and Boyd Holbrook create an efficient pair of villains with motivations whose insanity is amusingly masked by the seriousness with which they are expressed.Directed by James Mangold (""Ford vs. Ferrari""), the film features breathtaking action scenes from beginning to end. Furthermore, using computer graphics, the production removes Harrison Ford to place him in an adventure aboard a train in the past, as a way of contextualizing the plot. By constructing a plot, with a look and structure that is very reminiscent of films from the 1980s, Mangold gets the nostalgia and preservation of the essence of the character's adventures right. On the other hand, by constructing action scenes with quick cuts and full of CGI, he embraces a modern style of cinematography, uniting the best of two worlds for all ages. Mangold does an adequate job most of the time, creating efficient moments in the middle of elaborate set pieces such as the horse chase and the one involving rickshaws, but which suffer due to an excess of unconvincing digital effects and which disappoint even in basic shots such as the establishing shots at an airport and casino-hotel in Tangier, which fail to disguise that they were filmed on green screen. Furthermore, while Spielberg always found ways to give plausibility to the most fanciful passages (jumps between vines aside), Mangold shows a little more difficulty in repeating this feat - and if we can believe the ""invisible"" bridge in ""The Last Crusade"" and in the carriage that returns to the track after a long jump in ""Temple of Doom"", we cannot say the same about the horse on the subway line in ""Dial of the Destiny"".""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is a fun adventure, but leaves something to be desired in some aspects. The film improves on its predecessor, presenting a simple plot and exploring the maturation of Indiana Jones' character. The performances are strong points. However, James Mangold's direction fails to deliver impactful action sequences and to capture the essence of the previous films. The absence of iconic scenes and uncertainty about the future of the franchise are also points of concern. Overall, it's a fan-pleasing adventure, but one that could have reached a higher level with more careful execution. It makes you want to see more of that Indiana Jones from the first twenty minutes, exploring the anonymous life of a university professor or, riding a horse on the subway. These are much more exciting scenes than everything else the film presents to us. Indiana Jones and the ""Dial of the Destiny"" is not a bad film or even a disastrous one, but it lacks heart. And this is the biggest sin in a franchise like this, so loved over the decades. And the ideal, even for those who like the saga, is that the franchise comes to an end or at least rests for a long time, as we see a clear wear and tear and immense difficulty for the screenwriters to create something new that is truly worthwhile. Not to mention the fact that Harrison Ford can no longer do action scenes like he used to and that the character of Waller Bridge doesn't have an ounce of Ford's charisma and integrity to carry the franchise on his shoulders in the future.","6/10"
"fernandoschiavi","22 November 2020","War for Planet of the Apes offers a satisfactory conclusion to this new phase. Mature and at the same time poetic, War for the Planet of the Apes ends with a flourish one of the best current trilogies. Showing the outcome of the war between apes and humans, the third film is much more than the final clash between the races, it is the end point of a powerful discussion started since the first film about our sense of humanity and superiority that never leaves us.In this closing of the most recent trilogy, humans and apes cross paths again. Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his group are forced into a war against an army of soldiers led by a ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson), who does his best to ensure his survival when the virus that has decimated humanity begins to present a new side effect: speech loss in humans. When Caesar suffers a personal loss in a conflict, he sets up a personal mission to locate and neutralize the Colonel, aiming to end the war between humans and apes once and for all.In War for the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves concludes the prelude to the story of the 1968 film (based on the book by Frenchman Pierre Boulle) with the same urgencies as the previous features (Rise of the planet of the apes, 2011, and Dawn of the planet of the apes, 2014). The tone, however, is different, in a biblical mix of conflict and restart. Over a little over six years, we have followed César's evolution (a remarkable work by Andy Serkis). Not only from a technological point of view, with a clear leap in the movement capture technique (of which Serkis has already become an ambassador), but above all from a narrative perspective, full of meanings.
If Matt Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback had already offered something very simplistic and straightforward in Dawn of the planet of the apes, they further reduce the scale and events in War, which is limited to a journey of personal revenge in a narrative without many elements, nuclei of history or even dialogues. Almost all of the 140 minutes of projection are dedicated to Caesar and the core of apes, never diverting the point of view to any human character, who occupy - in the majority - the position of antagonism of the feature. This guarantees the most beautiful and rare moments in the current american blockbuster cinema scene, where various actions and thoughts are resolved through sign language, looks or simple bodily interactions; although César's speech is much improved in this film. The third part of the new franchise trilogy is not as exciting in terms of action as the previous film, but it certainly reflects and discusses its main themes with more depth and maturity than its predecessors.Precisely for these moments, the first act and the beginning of the second are the best moments of the projection. With an impressive opening scene that accompanies the soldiers invading the territory of the apes, Reeves does the favor of avoiding the pyrotechnics of the endless (nothing against, but they contributed little to the evolution of the narrative in the previous features) battle scenes. The war that the title announces takes place much more in a psych sociological field than in front scenes. The small expedition led by Caesar, made up of his companions Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket (Terry Notary) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) is a strong remnant of western cinema, with the quartet riding slowly across icy landscapes on Canadian soil, and especially melancholic because we are in a post-apocalyptic environment. In this way, we obtained beautiful images that Reeves and cinematographer Michael Seresin, also guaranteeing a good rhythm and a highly immersive atmosphere - the fantastic soundtrack by Michael Giacchino also deserves credits in the creation of this universe, bringing a beautiful waltz as a final theme.
Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback draw the parallels between fictional dystopia and our world: two opposing forces are at war with each other because of their distinct worldviews. It looks familiar, doesn't it? The similarities with reality are even more accentuated with the introduction of the Colonel (Woody Harrelson), the military leader who, in order to protect his soldiers, wants to build a wall that separates them from their enemies. The script builds the character in such a way that he personifies the worst in societies around the world today: the fear and hatred of the different, the subversion of the concept of justice to an ideal of revenge, the lack of dialogue and the widespread hostility to anything that might go against an old-fashioned concept of ""morals and good manners"".The emotional plot of War for the Planet of the Apes comes with great action sequences. Matt Reeves delivers an excellent direction completely inspired by New Hollywood from the 70s: the filmmaker applies here framing, lighting and camera movement techniques used by Stanley Kubrick (using the classic centralized framing), Martin Scorsese (using the cuts to create a vibrant rhythm for the scenes), Francis Ford Coppola (taking advantage of lights and shadows to create an atmosphere and reflect the mood of the characters on screen). The influence of films like Apocalypse Now, The Bridge on the River Kwai and The Ten Commandments is explicit. In this amalgamation of genres, Reeves, who signs the script with Mark Bomback, tells an epic story without falling into Manichaeism and goes far beyond the promise of the title war. The Colonel is not a mere villain in his opposition to Caesar, just as the hero is not perfect or infallible. The meeting of the two exposes the complex nature that determines ""humanity"" in the search for survival. Relationships packed with grandeur on the Michael Giacchino score, which alternates brutality and lightness in a journey of many layers, including bringing us a beautiful waltz as a final theme.Reeves proves that he knows not only how to use all the space on the screen, but how to position his camera in a way to decentralize the viewer's gaze. Even when working with gangs, the action does not become dull or lose focus. The camera follows the characters, without losing life in the midst of shots and explosions. The rhythm is built alternating between play and conflict, drama and humor, in a composition that never loses strength in the two hours and twenty minutes of the film fly by. In the first scene, we start with a long shot that introduces us to the soldiers, culminating in a violent confrontation and that already shows us how the visual effects are supernatural: the hair, looks and the light reflect in an extremely realistic way on the apes, each increasingly expressive. Reeves also brings his suspenseful hand from Let Me in and Cloverfield for more tense sequences, like the first encounter between Caesar and the Colonel; marked by shadows and beams of light from weapons and laser sights, and the great battle that ends the projection, full of small conflicts and climaxes that grab the viewer by the throat. It is impossible not to be moved.
The biggest problem is even in the second act, where the narrative takes a curve that appeals to its unpredictability, but ends up sinning in terms of rhythm and duration. More focused on what happens in the human nucleus, it is where Reeves and Bomback end up ""trying too hard"" to reach a dramatic and melancholic level, as if the thematic and visual reference to the Holocaust and Fascism were not enough by themselves - a similar problem that also hit Logan, where the film seems to try too hard to be something more complex and adult - although the dialogues of the excellent Woody Harrelson make this effort worthwhile. Guerra works precisely in its most subtle moments, and this exposure ends up harming and disturbing the good rhythm, besides extending the duration of the film too much.In addition to Reeves and Harrelson, another name that stands out in War for the Planet of the Apesis Andy Serkis, again giving life - through the performance capture technique, which makes the experience visceral. It is possible to see the actor in Cesar's eyes and, at the same time, completely forget the elaborate process necessary for the character to come to life. What you see is in fact a chimpanzee who loves his family, needs to guide a people and overcome a conflict in the search for a civilized life. Serkis transcends layers of equipment and delivers genuine emotion, with an impressive degree of expression and mastery of the body.Planet of the Apes: The War is a worthy and satisfying conclusion to this new trilogy that will definitely be remembered as one of the best commercial American cinema has ever seen. With a greater focus on personal dramas and metamorphoses, Pierre Boulle's creation has never been better represented. War for the Planet of the Apes is a cinematic experience of technical quality and dramatic reach. It is the return of classic cinema in technological packaging, made to entertain, but without underestimating its audience. The work may slightly disappoint those who seek an apotheosis even more frantic than Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, but it will certainly delight and dazzle those who, in the midst of so many shallow blockbusters, are looking for a commercial film that knows how to discuss their own themes with sobriety, maturity and without appealing to pedantry.","9/10"
"fernandoschiavi","29 March 2020","Finally, the long-awaited conclusion of a saga that was weaved ingeniously and meticulously for a decade by the House of Ideas, under the command of Kevin Feige. If before the studios practically did not bet on superhero films, ten years ago this reality changed completely when we saw ""Iron Man (2008)"" debut in theaters around the world, beginning a wide, complex and detailed shared universe, which gave life to characters that fans so longed to see transported to the cinema and becoming acquainted with others not so popular even among comic book fans. There were three phases that became known as the ""Infinity Saga"", in which we became intimate with Iron Homme, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange.Filmed simultaneously with ""Infinite War"", the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely continue to tell the story of the previous film. Here, superheroes must deal with the events of the previous film, in which half of the people in the galaxy were wiped out at Thanos' snap, including friends and family of our heroes. Those who are left are still, for more than three weeks, trying to locate Thanos who entered a portal and disappeared, while trying to find a solution to reverse what had happened.The first fifteen minutes invest in revenge and the consummation of failure: an introduction. The next sequences, which make up a first, more melancholic, yet vigorous act in re-presenting characters and renewing the previous status quo, have an emphasis on the intimate, precisely what drives Ultimato as an experience: a great show on a colossal scale, but that cares about a dance, a feeling, a heart, a family.""Ultimatum"" gets it right by dedicating more than half its duration to intensify the hopelessness, mourning and disbelief that the characters and the audience were going through together. In that time, he takes the opportunity to strengthen ties between unlikely characters, such as Toby Stark and Nebula, and also to show how old friends, such as Natasha, Rogers and Barton, Tony and Thor and Bruce, led their lives five years after the events of the beginning of the movie. The characters have their own layers, monsters and voids, to add to the project itself, which is a mooring of several narrative arches, the sustenance of a three-hour cathartic work. Especially interesting is Tony's bow, living alongside his great love and his little daughter, being the counterpoint to Barton, who had his life transformed after the loss of his family, becoming a vengeful murderer who eliminates those he does not consider worthy. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers went on to help other planets that also suffered from Thanos' actions.After the presentation of the current situation of each of the heroes, it is when Scott Lang enters the story, who managed to return from the quantum kingdom, after the post-credits scenes that we had followed in ""Ant Man and the Wasp"". He then explains that the laws of physics and space-time do not apply to the quantum realm, theorizing that they could travel through time through the Pym Particles and the portal. From there, after seeing an old photo of him with Peter Parker, Tony ends the time travel equation and the Avengers, with the exception of Danvers, split into groups to return to the past and retrieve the Infinity Stones and that's when Marvel takes audiences on an unforgettable journey celebrating 11 years of their shared universe, revisiting films like ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and even the controversial ""Thor: The Dark World"" .Banner, Rogers, Lang and Stark return to 2012, during Loki's invasion of New York, to retrieve the Tesseract, Loki's scepter and the Eye of Agamotto. They also end up going to 1970 at the S.H.I.E.L.D. in Lehigh to get another version of the Tesseract, which was being tested by the military and to get more particles from Hank Pym, who had just invented them. Meanwhile, Thor and Rocket return to Asgard in 2013 to extract Jane Foster's Reality Gem. Clint and Natasha return to Vormir in 2014 to retrieve the Soul Gem, while Rhodes and Nebula go to Morag, also in 2014, where Peter Quill is about to steal the Gem of Power. This whole time travel will culminate in the great final battle, after Thanos discovering the heroes' plan, where the destiny of the universe will be at stake again.The cast reaches the height of their characters' understanding, completing a whole development arc. In addition to the main cast, which is already extremely numerous, there are still several cameos from great actors and actresses who showed up in previous productions. Robert Redford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman, William Hurt, are just a few of those names, and some of them literally go silent and leave quietly.With a million dollar budget of US $ 356 million, the film justifies the use of every penny and obviously will not have any difficulty in recovering and sometimes exceeding the high amount invested. They are effects used for the rejuvenation of characters, the construction of scenarios from different eras and worlds, dozens of intergalactic beings from the most different backgrounds and visual effects of a scale and perfection rarely seen. Not for nothing, ""Ultimatum"" was nominated for an Oscar in the category. Few times have we seen so many characters gathered together, with several actions taking place simultaneously, and everything wonderfully orchestrated by the precise direction of the Russo brothers, who manage to maintain a perfect unity and synchrony. The final battle against Thanos that takes up almost the entire last hour of the three that lasts the film, will be remembered as one of the biggest and most spectacular in the history of cinema. There, we can see the full potential of all the heroes presented by the MCU in these years should be a delight for fans of the universe. Not to mention the emotional and beautifully post-battle scenes that tie up all the last loose ends of the Infinity Saga. The audience is in tears. And it is not a daydream or exaggeration.The soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, responsible for the famous Avengers theme, composed for the 2012 film, is once again perfect, elevating drama, melancholy and epic action to the tenth power. In the musical part, ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", by Traffic, ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"", by The Kinks, ""Doom and Gloom"" by the Rolling Stones and ""Hey Lawdy Mama"", by Steppenwolf are some of the songs that are present. The production designer of the always competent Charles Wood and photography by Trent Opaloch, who uses and abuses the darkest filters that give the greatest degree of drama and pessimism that guide much of the feature film are used with mastery.Throughout the film, the Russo brothers think millimetrically about each scene, sometimes to make the audience cry, sometimes to laugh and sometimes to cheer for the heroes in their battles. As well as the conclusion of the saga ""Harry Potter"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", the great megalomaniac of ""Ultimatum"" will remain in the minds of the moviegoers as one of those epic films that practically everyone has watched. And the end, still holds great surprises, some that envision a future of the Universe, such as those involving Thor and The Guardians of the Galaxy and the passing of Captain America's baton.""Ultimatum"" works above all expectations: it not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies. The film proves to have been planned in detail by the studio's creative minds, who know more than anyone else, how to please their audience. Although ""Ultimatum"" seems to be the end of the Infinity Saga, phase 3 will officially end with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", which should still have consequences for this film in the life of Peter Parker, especially with the death of someone very close and dear to the hero.","10/10"
"feyipuk","13 June 2018","After building up Caesar and the other apes in the first two films, this third one seems so contrived - especially the last twenty minutes - it almost ruins what is otherwise an interesting film. 
Here, the super smart chimpanzee, his family and all the other primates that supported him on the last movie are up against an American Colonel (Woody Harrelson), his assortment of monkey hating soldiers - so not much change to the previous films - and also ""Donkeys""; apes who support the humans. All have complicated relationships which the film could have developed further, rather than the cliched ending that went from action to completion faster than a monkey up a tree.Obviously, the special effects are amazing. The interaction between human and ape are pretty flawless. Nova (Amiah Miller) may get shoe horned into the film, but the way she is able to interact with Maurice (Karin Konoval) is pretty impressive. And watching Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) careen around with his extremely expressive is a comic interlude from all the serious activities going on on the screen.For the most part, the film was alright. Right up until after the Colonel has probably the longest spoken scene in the film (which isn't hard when you know only one ape can talk, though all the apes can understand English), it moved at a good pace. It just seemed like the producers then felt they needed to wrap it up in a nice, complete manner, which maybe wasn't needed.","5/10"
"Fields201","23 November 2012","Life of Pi is one of those films that you would think about leaving the theater and would stick with you for a long while. It has a lasting appeal, and a great ending that is not often seen in films these days as most film endings suck.It didn't start out strong though as we follow an older Pi telling his story to a journalist. He covers the younger years of his life, and if anyone has ever seen The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, you will know that his earlier years is fairly boring. We discover why his name is Pi, and its from a swimming pool. Okay. It isn't until he gets older where we finally see him on that boat and that big tidal wave hits, and the imagery is astounding. Pi is thrust into a lifeboat and this is really where our movie begins. Pi is trapped on a boat with animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a fierce tiger. In fact, most of the movie is spent with Pi surviving hunger and not being eaten by this tiger in the middle of the ocean. What a great concept! It's also narrated by Pi, and its fantastic!If there is one complaint that I think most people would agree on is the use of very heavy CG. You can almost say there is too much CG and what is some beautiful cinematography. The tiger especially as it looks very good, but at times you can tell it was CG. You would notice this on a scene on a beach where the tiger is walking. The movement seems a little off and it ruins some of the realism on what could have been a very emotional scene.I can't recommend Life of Pi enough though. There's so many things I could say about it and it is a fantastic journey that if I saw it as a kid, it would be one of those movies I look back on and love even just for nostalgia sake. I'm seeing it again with my mom. This is one journey I think everyone should experience!","7/10"

"Filipe_R_Santos89","23 February 2023","I don't understand all the hate that has been distilled for the latest Marvel movies... I only understand from ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", which really was a waste of funds for such a bad movie.But this movie is not bad. It's not one of the best, but it's not bad at all.Don't forget that this movie was shot at the time of the pandemic and I believe it took some extra work and adjustments.In my opinion I was only concerned about two things, the fact that Scott starts to become associated with a comical, sometimes awkward character and another is that on one hand we see a very comic book-like Cassie, but on the other hand it seems that there is a blockage on the part of Kevin Feige's team to be faithful to the elements of the ""original story"", which bothers me a bit being a fan of the comics - in short, that's my opinion.I really enjoyed Kang, all the content, and I confess I was apprehensive about the MODOK presentation, but I was fascinated by the work that was done.To like a Marvel movie you have to understand this universe, and I still think that many of the people who rate it negatively don't know what they are talking about at all.Conclusion, good movie...not perfect, and by far to be one of the best.I really hope they grab these new characters that are appearing (America Chavez, Ms Marvel, Cassie Lang, Kate Bishop...) and give the ""Young Avengers"" a future because I think it could work well.","4/10"
"filipemanuelneto","3 June 2022","After having seen this film, which adapts a novel with the same name, I was in doubt about what to think. Directed by Ang Lee, the film is a true visual spectacle and takes advantage of the best that high-quality CGI can add to a film. However, we have to agree that it is a still film, which stretches its story as far as it can, placing it on a metaphysical and theological background that can complicate the story for some people.Piscine Molitor Patel, called Pi Patel to facilitate and avoid embarrassing puns, is the young hero of this film. He was born and lives with his family in Pondicherry, in former French India. However, finances are not going well, and they are forced to leave, closing the zoo they manage there, and leaving for Canada with most of the animals. It so happens that, during the trip, the Japanese freighter they boarded on is caught in a typhoon and sinks. Clinging to a lifeboat, he survives, accompanied by Richard Parker, the irascible and terrifying Bengal tiger from his family's zoo, beginning a journey of survival and discovery of the sacred, and of himself.In fact, if there is one thing that stood out before my eyes in this film, it is the search that the main character makes about God, since childhood, in which he assumes several religions that are perfectly different. He seems to be engaged in a search for God's truth, not just experimenting with religions and beliefs, or mixing them up to his liking. The trip on that boat, therefore, reminds us a little of the despair of biblical figures like Jonah or Job, from whom everything was taken away so that, in the depths of their misery, they could find God. The film still makes a number of small changes when compared to the original book. I'm not the best person to evaluate them, but I'm not surprised by these creative liberties.Suraj Sharma is a completely unknown actor to me, but he does his part very well here, and he sounds authentic and true. He is the great actor present in the film and it is his work that gives him body and soul. Irrfan Khan was also up to his task and makes a welcome and very successful contribution. In between, we see Gerard Depardieu in a brief cameo that adds little to the film.Technically, the film makes clever and creative use of computer resources, CGI and green screen, as mentioned earlier. The quality of the work is such that we are in doubt about what we are seeing, especially with regard to the animals and their coat and appearance. The meerkat island was also magnificent, and there are several scenes at sea where light was masterfully used. The cinematography and editing were masterfully executed, the sets and costumes are authentic and the soundtrack is truly good and engaging.","10/10"
"Film_star","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","1/10"
"Filmdokter","25 October 2021","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.","10/10"
"FinalSmash1689","30 June 2023","PROS:
-The opening sequence was great (despite deep-fake Indy)-Harrison Ford gives a great performance.-Mads Mikkelsen is always great.CONS:
-Indy gets the Jake Skywalker treatment. His happy ending from the previous film is completely taken from him.-Phoebe Waller-Bridge is completely unlikeable.-Boring for an adventure movie. Feels very paint by the numbers.-Teddy can just fly a plane by jumping in the cockpit ... okay.-Indy sits out most of the 3rd act, making it ""Helena and the Dial of Destiny"".-The 3rd act reveal is just stupid.-Indy's choice in the 3rd act goes completely against his character.Well, Lucasfilm strikes again. This is The Last Jedi of Indiana Jones. This is a soulless corporate made product. It's an imitation of an imitation. You can tell the script is missing George and Steven's influence. The action feels very modern day and not practical at all like the previous Indiana Jones films. I'm not a fan of Crystal Skull but at least it gave Indy a happy ending and a family. Here, both of those are stripped from him, giving us yet another broken and disenfranchised hero who's here to get shown up by his new female counterpart at every turn (sound familiar). Phoebe Waller-Bridge sinks this film. She's constantly unlikeable, talks down to Indy and even takes center stage in the 3rd act, while Indy sits on the sidelines with a gunshot wound. Speaking of which, the 3rd act of this film is a mess. The reveal of the true purpose of the Dial is ridiculous and feels too 'out-there' even for an Indy movie. Indy makes a choice near the end that is the equivalent of Luke throwing the Lightsaber over his shoulder. Indiana Jones DOES NOT GIVE UP!!! Even when all the odds are against him, he never gives up! Harrison Ford gave a great performance, despite the writing of his character, as does Mads Mikkelsen but they alone cannot save this movie. Indiana Jones ended for me in 1989, when Indy rode off into the sunset. I'll never watch this again. 3/10.","5/10"
"finnconnelly-63017","5 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse has done the impossible: be better than Into the Spider-Verse. And by leaps and bounds too. The animation is spectacular. Every frame looks like a Van Gogh, a Picasso. It makes Into the Spider-Verse look like a first grader painted it. The voice cast is very well done, Oscar Isaac, Haliee Steinfeld, and Andy Samberg are definite highlights. The action sequences are superb, but they complement a fantastic story that when its massive cliffhanger hits you, you'll be begging for more. Daniel Pemberton brings his A game once again with a score that's even better than the first. Across the Spider-Verse succeeds in every way, and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.","9/10"

Just amazing.","2/10"
"FishDrowned","17 November 2021","Wow where do I start. The thought of bringing all the characters of many many movies hasn't been really explored in a more recent time. This is what the MCU has been building up for the many years. And the Ending is so perfect. I think it in-bodies the comic pretty well but at the same time manages to keep it as cinematographic as possible.","1/10"
"fisherbee1-1","16 July 2017","I was excited to go watch this installment having really enjoyed the previous two movies. Seeing it, however, was quite disappointing. The visuals were fine, as expected, and the acting was as good as ever. The story, however, seemed to crawl, and the anti-American anti-military, and anti-Christian references removed any remaining enjoyment. Instead of seeing things from both perspectives, as we did in the previous two movies, it's all from the viewpoint of the apes, and humans are seen as evil, and mostly shallow. No deep human characters in the entire film, no perspective of the humans; just flat villains about which the apes have to worry. There are some references to the old film series, which fans will notice, and an amusing few places, but the political theming and dragging storyline make this one far under par.","1/10"
"FixedYourEnding","9 February 2024","The Beekeeper is a typical Jason Statham action movie, with lots of fights, explosions, and cheesy one-liners. Statham plays a former assassin who goes on a revenge spree against a corrupt tech company that ruined the life of a friend. The plot is thin, the dialogue is bad, and the villains are cartoonish and forgettable, the movie is ridiculous, over-the-top and even offensive at times, but... I totally enjoyed it.The revenge on the bad actors in this film (no pun intended) is really fun and rewarding, it is like all the people you wished you could do that to got the revenge in the way the deserve. Statham is doing his usual job in inflicting pain on everybody that stands in his way, the pacing in the movie is great and there is never a dull moment. Statham is the action, everything else is a 2nd fiddle in his symphony, including the supporting actors, are all there to be props in his quest.And yes, don't try to make sense of the story while watching this, it will ruin the movie for you. This is a beer (or coke) and popcorn movie start to finish. The tech part in the movie, as well as all the government conspiracies, although based on real occurrences is completely blown out of proportion but still a lesson to be had. The bees knew what they were doing.Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this action flick! Exact score: 68 / 100.","7/10"
"fkarpenko","22 July 2017","I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me but after seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that the previous films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly good movie. I was incredibly disappointed. **SPOILERS** My first trouble with the film happened with the appearance of the little girl, who seemed to serve absolutely no purpose other than to spontaneously cause tear- jerking moments which were accompanied by sad music in every instance. Throughout the film there must have been around 10 of these, all of them completely pointless and forced. It also baffled me that she had close to 0 reaction to her father dying yet, when a gorilla who she had known for literally one day died, she wept like it was her brother. Another massive problem is that the entire plot of this movie hinges on one condition: that every single person out of the ~1,000 soldiers at the concentration camp is a complete and utter imbecile. Caesar's crew is running around right outside of the walls of the camp? Of course no one notices, why would anyone be on over-watch at a military base? All of the monkeys escape from their cages? Of course there was only one person watching over them. In addition to that, for the duration of what seemed like 10 minutes no one else even noticed that all the monkeys were gone or that the single guard watching over them was killed. Are these real soldiers!? Even statistically, what are the chances that not a single soldier looked at a cage that is in plain view from any part of the camp. These were just the most glaring issues I had with the film. So little thought went into the script. These are incredibly basic problems which could have been fixed with even the slightest effort, This movie was so incredibly dumb that even my friend who doesn't have much interest in film asked me if I wanted to leave before the film was over.","5/10"
"FKDZ","26 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a okay addition and end to the franchise but it certainly wasn't needed nor added anything worthwhile. Whilst I didn't hate it the movie also didn't leave me with anything to reminisce about. It surprisingly focused on being somewhat sad and sentimental. The way to go out should've been Indy's biggest adventure yet, with history, caves, tombs and mystery. Not running thorough a parade and driving a tuk tuk.Directorially it doesn't really do anything. Some scenes are nice and there's glimpses of nice moments. But action scenes are messy, mainly due to the elephant in the room: having and old man fight. It either makes for comically easy enemies, or very chaotic scenes where you are intentionally disoriented.The de-aged section of the movie. I liked it a lot and it felt like a great start of the movie. The CGI de-aging for me was very noticeable though, there's this distinct softness to his young face that just doesn't sell it to me. It's not uncanny, but it's noticeable.Story and characters. I think the side characters are fine. If Helena (Waller-Bridge) had more to work with than what we got it might've been better. I'm happy they didn't try to replace Indy like in crystal skull. The levity the Helena character brought was a warm welcome to the depressing storyline they attached to Indy. Imo this feels like a weird direction for Indy to go. Compared to the first three movies I just don't see how he became what he is in the movie, it's far fetched, they try to explain it but it doesn't work for me. The story tends to drag a little but is split with some decent action scenes. But when Ford is having to be the action hero, it just becomes a bit of a parody simply because Ford has gotten really old, and it's emphasized in the movie. And counter that with comically inept villains and well.. it borders on comedy, tension is lost. I did however love the story element at the end. But that was needed so much sooner, that's where the movie should've been all this time. The ultimate Indy finale. Living history.Special shoutout to the worst most uninteresting side character Teddy. Seriously could not have been written to be more boring. Made me miss shortround. Even Willie.. The way it handled some side characters like Renaldo was a bit odd.Acting, everybody is kind of there. I was most disappointed with Mikkelsen, just not memorable. Indy villains tend to be fairly memorable but not so much here. Very generic.Music, the Indy theme is there and effective. Not much else.All in all it's a okay end to the franchise (until they reboot it). But I felt like this should've been the biggest adventure with the most amount of history and exploration. But sadly not.","7/10"
"Flak36","29 June 2023","I just returned from the theatre and now I finally have my own opinion after so many mixed reviews. Those who hate it exaggerate just as they did with Crystal Skull.I know that nobody asked for a fifth movie. But they made one and fortunately for us it's good. It truly is and it doesn't have to be perfect.There were three or four moments where I didn't like Helen. I believe the vast majority of fans know what I'm talking about and agree with it. The rest of the movie is fantastic, including the opening action sequence in 1944 with the de-ageing.The finale was something I would never have guessed and I loved it. No spoilers. If you're like me and you're worried that this movie might suck go watch it. You will enjoy it.","6/10"
"Flak36","4 June 2023","I see tons of 10s and 9s so it must be a good movie except I had no idea what is going on.The visual style was beautiful and so was the animation. Those were the only aspects I enjoyed and even so, the movie is so overstretched and boring that I fell asleep halfway through for a few minutes.By the way, if I want to read a comic I don't have to go to the movies. Especially the filter to make the entire picture look like comic book paper was unnecessary.I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm in the minority of viewers who didn't like it. But I'll definitely won't be watching another one. I guess if I knew what's going on I would have liked it?","10/10"
"FlashCallahan","12 July 2017","Caesar is forced into a deadly conflict with a ruthless colonel, after his eldest son and wife are slaughtered. After unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker side and begins his own quest to avenge his kind. As his journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in a battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet..........First off, anyone who wants to use the term 'Ape-pocalypse Now', don't bother, it's literally used in the film.And what a film. After a plethora of worthless 'blockbusters' released this year, this treats the audience like they have a brain, rather than having the script spout Basil Exposition every three minutes.And as for the script, there are large portions of the film where there is no dialogue, we just focus on Caesar and his journey. But in these sections, dialogue isn't really needed, we can see the pain in Caesars face and gait, and it carries the narrative far more than having dialogue for the sake of it.The film is technically brilliant, the apes are so lifelike, you forget that the are nothing more than actors in 'Running Man' jump suits covered in mini ping pong balls. And if this film doesn't win a plethora of awards, there is something wrong with the planet (of the apes).Serkis is perfect as Caesar, show more human emotion than any of the human characters, his journey is a long and painful one, and I know the air conditioning was on, but I felt really cold during the second and final act.Harrelson as the Colonel, does have similarities to Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, but he is more similar to Barnes from Platoon, as he has method in his madness, and one prolonged scene between him and Caesar is touching as well as sinister, him explaining the reasoning of why he is doing what he's doing.Talking about similarities, whilst watching this, I was reminded of several films. The Revenant, Deliverance, Saving Private Ryan, Temple Of Doom, The Last Castle, and even Braveheart, but I wasn't longing to see any of these films because I was fully involved in this from beginning to end.Zahn is a welcome addition as 'Bad Ape' and even if the film is very serious, he provides a lot of laugh out loud moments.It's a real big thing to say, but in my opinion, it's the perfect live action trilogy, the film film ends perfectly, they couldn't have done anything else to make it better.Bookended with two wonderfully crafted set pieces, WFTPOTA (which no one is calling it) could be one of the films of the year. The film making is so perfect, you forget you are watching a film where 80 percent of the characters are CGI.Full of metaphorical references to apartheid, Slavery, and nature versus nurture, the film is epic on a momentous scale. It's thrilling from beginning to end.Quite wonderful.","10/10"
"FlashCallahan","21 February 2023",".........and that literally is a line from the film, summing up how the MCU has become since Covid hit the world. Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.","6/10"
"FlashCallahan","4 July 2023","Daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.Accompanied by his goddaughter, and a wannabe Short-Round, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA, and his henchmen, one who looks like Pat Roach, and one who Mangold must like because he was the bad guy in Logan.....Did this film really need to be made? There are two camps in regards to this. For people who really disliked KOTCS, yes, because they wanted him to go out with a bang. And no, they should have left it with Last Crusade, and didn't really want to see Ford don the fedora one more time.Did I enjoy it?Through gritted teeth I say yes. But am I saying I enjoyed it because I love the franchise, and I can't bring myself to say it was a tad boring in places and I should have deserved it more because I grew up with Indiana Jones?Time will tell, which is ironic considering the maguffin.Ford as expected is brilliant, and we see a disillusioned, very different Indy in him. He's slightly bitter at the world because of something that happened a few years before, and he's weary, tired of everything around him, almost becoming an artefact himself, as he appears reluctant to accept the changing world around him.The first twenty minutes is truly astonishing, and up there with the best set pieces of the franchise, but still the poorest of all of the films openings. And unfortunately the de-aging effects are pretty poor, and the fact that his voice sounds older is jarring at times, and really puts you off at times. But once we are on the train, it goes full pelt.After that, it does go slightly downhill, and never reaches the heights of the opening. Waller-Bridge is a welcome addition to the franchise, and she holds her own against Ford, even though she can be slightly annoying at times. And she has her own Short-Round following her about. And guess what? They met the same way as Indy met Shorty.Mikkelsen is truly wonderful as the big evil, and he oozes menace and charm in equal measures. This is one great villain, and Mikkelsen knows that his character is brilliant.There is a really good chase sequence in the middle of the film, it's funny, pretty breathtaking, and harks back to the first three movies. Another highlight of the movie.But there are a few negatives.Banderas is wasted, and I feel that a lot of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. He barely has any lines, and the scenes we see him almost depict him as a very stupid person. Seeing that he is on the main posters for this just made me slightly annoyed, as he must only have about two minutes of screen time. It's a real problem for me, how ever trivial it may seem.Apart from one very touching scene, they reference the other films too bluntly, especially TOD, which is mentioned twice for some reason, and it's just a little cringey, especially when TOD is my favourite of the franchise (cinema trips with my dad we're golden days, that's why I love it).And then there is the final act. Depending on how you feel, this could be genius, or just plain stupid. But seeing as he has found the Holy Grail, The Ark of The Covenant, and dealt with aliens, I'll let it pass. But it's so random it will make you think 'really?' for a hot second.And one last thing, the film reminded me a little of Hudson Hawk. Both films have our heroes looking for different parts of an object across the world, and the object in question will change the world. But that's not a critique at all, just something I noticed.So all in all, it's a fun movie. A little slow at times, but I could not see a reason to cut anything from the film to make it a little shorter. It's not great, but die hard fans will get something out of this.A grower for sure.","8/10"
"flavio_zanatta","6 January 2019","Since the release of the new DBS series I was so sad about the poor animation, the poor storyline, the horrible drawing traits, but this movie changed everything.

Are we going to keep up DBS with the same good level of the movie or are we going to go back to that awfull drawing and poor story?
Now about the movie I was definetelly impressed. Very well directed, they finally gave the whole context, well explained and very well animated. CGI was used in the right moments and throughout the movie I felt that feeling from DBZ and in the theather I went, the session was full, the vibe was absolutelly amazing, everybody was so happy to see Veggeta turning to Super Saying God and the fusion between them is just outstanding, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.

"flavours_ignobleo","3 January 2024","I absolutely loved the previous movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, it became my favourite animation to date by far. The storyline, animation and soundtrack is amazing! 10/10...But I lost interest in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse within 30mins. The storyline felt boring, repetitive and scatty. The cramming in of as many teen and family cliches as possible (in order to make it relatable no doubt) felt very forced and unnatural. It made it more of a teen movie, rather than for all the family like the last one. There is also a sense that the Diversity Equity Inclusion 'committee' strongly informed the story and characters, which again came across as forced, which left me wondering was their top priority writing a great story, or was it to meet certain DEI quotas.Anyway this film does not compare to the previous and I have no idea why it's scored so highly, one film is an absolute masterpiece, the other is a giant action-packed cliche.","9/10"
"flicklover","18 February 2023","Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being a complete snooze fest. I was actually bored fir much if the film.Just below average in an MCU that is just churning out film after film with diminishing results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films good when they first started. They are getting so formulaic and forgettable.Below average.....Grade: C-","5/10"

Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised.

It's got the trappings of a war film, and there's some conflict, but anyone expecting factions of apes and humans frothing at the mouth and charging toward one another in a last desperate battle for supremacy are going to be sorely disappointed.With a glacial pace, one dimensional characters and ham-fisted drama, War utterly wastes its impressive technical merits.

"frank_kneepkens","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","1/10"
"Frankaub-1","2 July 2019","If you go see this movie, go see it in an IMAX 3D or something like that because 3 hours is too long for this movie.The story is really bad I van understand that they don't want to repeat the same story in the comic book but the reason why Thanos choose to wipeout half the population is just stupid and what he do after that? Yeah he destroy the stone and retire. What a great villain...So our super hero go take care of Thanos easily and then nothing for a very long period of time. For a Marvel movie their is not much action and for an intelligent, deep or funny movie that's not a bad thing but for a movie like this it's just boring. I guess they think that since their is a lot of action at the end that we will forget the middle.They other thing that really bother's me is how important it seem to show how strong women are. The power of women yeah... Men are lazy, dumb and useless like thor in this movie and women are strong and save the day like Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Gamora etc.Marvel's writers must understand that Easter eggs, some action at the end of the film and showing the power of feminity do not make up for a bad script.the only thing that I really like in this movie is that finally we saw some hero die.","9/10"
"fraser-simons","19 February 2023","This movie was really weird, and some of the ways it was weird worked, and some really, really didn't. The art direction and cgi was inspired though, making it, at least a spectacle to consume. The tonal shifts and comedic timing were more miss than hit, the stakes never really feel real. It actually feels basically all but completely unnecessary and is extremely predictable along the way.If the movie didn't have this weird alien aesthetic that works, it would have probably flopped, for me. The marketing makes it seem like an action packed, quite serious, but family almost travelogue - but it's basically just lots of weird stuff with dumb gags and jokes. I think had they stuck to what it purported to be in the trailers it would have actually worked a lot better, though not by any means at all heavy on theme.","6/10"
"fraser-simons","2 July 2023","This was a lot more fun than I expected, and I pretty much purely expected a romp. The and shots and attention to historical nostalgia and great set design, really all the production is just hit out of the park. Way more jokes than I expected landed, the story is very well paced, knowing what is appealing about the franchise and playing to its strengths.What I didn't expect, was how chefs kiss the ending would be. The third act goes a bit off the rails, otherwise the movie is 4*+, but it really, really nails the ending, along with the treatment of the Nazis and the outcome. It really treats that element well and actually has a little something to say about Indie, which was icing on the top. Everything talked about in the film is used for content, with fun foreshadowing occurring that I doubt anybody would really expect. Just a great time.","2/10"
"freddyelmst","20 January 2024","The Beekeper: 4.5 out of 5.I'll watch anything Jason Statham is in. Yeah, I even enjoyed Expendables 4 (despite the obvious challenges covid created for it- so much green screen work😔) but The Beekeeper is well and truly a return to form.He plays a retired ""Beekeeper"" (some shadowy secret-secret-secret agent type thing) who actually does keep bees and is borderline obsessed with them. Anyway he has someone he cares about taken from him due to some nefarious scamming organisation with links to the government. Statham-mode kicks in and of course he goes on to attempt to avenge her death in an all out action extravaganza.Sure it's a pretty linear story - you know where it's going to ultimately end up - but the fun is in the journey. Many skulls were cracked along the way, and there was even a safety demonstration on how NOT to use a bandsaw.Directed by David Ayer (who made the underrated old-Arnie action flick Sabotage). Keep an eye out for a cameo by a T-800 Terminator Endoskeleton in the Beekeeper! 🙃The Beekeeper is a fun ride. Switch off the brain and enjoy!","10/10"
"fredrikgunerius","18 October 2023","Life of Pi tells the remarkable story of a young Indian boy (Suraj Sharma) whose family decide to relocate to Canada along with their zoo of animals. Then a massive storm sets in, the ship goes down, and Pi finds himself the only human survivor in a lifeboat along with a wounded zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger, and they must all fight for survival in an unforgiving Pacific ocean whilst learning to relate to each other.Hailed for its breathtaking 3D visuals and fantastic story, Life of Pi is an obvious crowd-pleaser celebrating life, nature, and a romanticized version of the survival of the fittest. At its best, the movie encapsulates much of what the film medium has to offer, but I don't care too much for Ang Lee's direction here. It's too showy, too overspirited, like something made high on drugs. Nature's wonders and carefully selected 3D-friendly images are being thrown at you whenever Lee feels the need to embellish. Additionally, the conversational narrative form makes the first part of the film too talky and explanatory. In a film as devoted to imagery as this, I would have wished the filmmakers had used the rich visuals more to tell the story than to brag.The highlights are few and far between, but in the film's middle part - the survival segments - Lee finally lets his images speak for themselves, and this is easily the pinnacle of the film. The interplay between the boy and the tiger is among the most believable and interesting aspects in an otherwise at times unbelievable setting, and it combines tension and suspense with several fascinating psychological and behaviouristic observations.The richness of this story is unquestionable, and I suspect the novel could be a good read, but the film only works partially because it's too unfocused and shallow. Some will claim that fantastical elements needn't be believable or accounted for, but in Life of Pi these elements work merely as an excuse for scoring cheap points and preach pretentiously about the importance of having faith, believing in yourself, follow your dreams, and several other vapid Hollywoodish clichés. Life of Pi will probably be a wet dream for uncritical AMPAS members, but it's really one of the most flawed movies of the year - albeit never completely uninteresting.","9/10"
"FrenchEddieFelson","24 April 2019","This is probably one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the moment, with Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The previous opus of the Avengers series, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), had left 'us' high and dry, in the depths of the abyss, while the latest episode of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel (2019), gave 'us' back a glimmer of hope.In short, I saw it in Paris this morning and I enjoyed it. It's an efficient blockbuster. The script and the manifold plot twists permanently keep the audience spellbound and breathless. This movie is one of the funniest and one of the most spectacular of the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe saga, not to mention an astonishing Computer-Generated Imagery, despite manifold script weaknesses that I will partially reveal below, within a dedicated post-script.Otherwise, a very unusual observation, at least within Paris: the audience has repeatedly applauded, at least 7/8 times, including the very beginning and the end of the movie, conveying an uncontrollable impatience, like a collective catharsis boosted to the extreme. And a female teen, about 17/18 years old, not far from me, cried. Literally! The audience was obviously made up of fans conquered beforehand... and that was part of the show!So Marvel, what's next? I am probably addicted and certainly impatient!As a post-script, a few remarks, annoyances or even irritations:1) First, a tiny spoiler as a favor. You will get absolutely nothing at the very end. Contrary to the Marvel habits and customs, there is no post-credit scene.2) The first half-hour is an immeasurable disappointment. While Thanos had, in the first opus, undertaken a Herculean task, a titanic challenge, a Homeric Odyssey in order to gather the 6 infinity stones and ""bring balance to the universe"" as a demiurge, in the second opus, he contents himself with a miserable and lonely life such as a peasant from the Middle Ages, because ""the stones served no purpose beyond temptation"". Wooooow! Literally incredible.3) Who understood this quote from Tony Stark to Steve Rogers? ""It's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might have wound up pushing time through Lang"". Honestly, I do not know if we need an IQ above 250 or below 60 to understand this quote...4) During the manifold fights versus the Avengers, we do not really see the difference between Thanos with the 6 infinity stones and Thanos without: his power seems unchanged!5) Time travel exists fundamentally in two versions: a change in the past will or will not have an impact in the future. Even if the first category is the most representative with classics such as The Terminator (1984) or Back to the Future (1985), Avengers: Endgame (2019) clearly belongs to the second category.6) For their time heist, the Avengers break down into 3 separate teams to join 3 distinct time-spaces in which there are 3 Thanos. One Thanos in each space-time: New-York in 2012, Asgard in 2013, Morag+Vormir in 2014. During 60 minutes, we follow these 3 concomitant stories. The Thanos from 2014 discovers and understands the whole intrigue thanks to his daughter Nebula. Nevertheless, the Avengers are able to switch from one space-time to another one, thanks to a protective suit, a GPS bracelet and a capsule containing Pym particles. Thus, these three elements are specially designed by Tony Stark, with the posthumous help of Hank Pym, for such an expedition and are a priori mandatory for the way in and the way back. But we do not really know how, the Thanos from 2014 will go back in time with his faithful right-hand man Ebony Maw, the whole armada and a huge spaceship. Wooooow! Even alone, this time-travel should be impossible.7) For the time heist in Vormir, why Natacha Romanoff and Clint Barton have to go first through Morag, with James Rhodes and Nebula? The Avengers could have splitted the whole team in 4 instead of 3 from the start, right? So, why 3 teams instead of 4? Knowing that I see no reason for this detour via Morag, I think that the scriptwriters were desperately stuck and were looking for a way for the Thanos of 2014 to recover a free fast-pass, i.e. a protective suit + a GPS bracelet + a Pym capsule. Those of the mortal remains of Natacha Romanoff. Except that the Thanos of 2014 was absolutely not aware of the presence of this corpse on Vormir. In any way!8) The scriptwriters have combined two ultra-complex concepts, i.e. time travel and quantum realm, in order to optimally cheat the audience. Indeed, when Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are back in New-York, they are magically able to time-travel from New-York in 2012 to Camp Lehigh in 1970 without the help of any quantum tunnel device...9) .... and so on ... and so on ... The screenwriters had obviously bigger eyes than belly! In short, this is a typical pop corn movie: turn your brain off, and then, and then only, enjoy the show!10) At last, a two-penny question: where did they find inspiration for the hairstyles? A moronic soccer player for Clint Barton, undoubtedly. Without forgetting Carol Danvers, or how to disfigure a sex bomb with a pair of scissors?That's all, folks!","10/10"

"gabethedinosaur","2 June 2023","It was absolutely awesome. I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .","10/10"
"gabethedinosaur","30 June 2023","After 24 years since I was a kid I remember watching Indiana Jones on vhs when I was about 4 years old. Raiders of the lost ark really impacted my childhood. The ark ghost gave me nightmares for days . Temple of doom was absolutely one of my favorite childhood movies . Last crusade with the holy grail and Indy's dad was like a combination of father joins the son and goes after the holy grail before the German nazies find it first. The Crystal skull ohh that one was absolutely one of the best movies I ever saw 15 years ago when I was 12 years old before I was 13 . The dial of destiny was I say by far the most remarkable final chapters of Indy's last adventure. Seeing Salah since raiders of the lost ark , and the last crusade really made Indiana Jones a better story . The beginning part of Indy taking place during the end of ww2 was the perfect plot . Indy fights the nazies one last time after Hitler killed himself was by far the best part of the film . Seeing young Harrison ford was really incredible. 1969 the start of Apollo 11 landing on the moon was the perfect way to show Indy seeing the world changing after the beginning of ww1 Great Depression 1929 to the 1930s which included his adventures during 1935 the eye of Mara , temple of doom , 1936 the ark , 1938 the holy grail and the start of ww2 , 1944 the end of the war , 1957 the Cold War and the Crystal skull aka alien skull , and 1969 the Vietnam war and the Apollo moon landing and time travel . The nazies traveling to the era of bc was by far a crazy mistake. They tried to travel to the 1939 during the start of ww2 but it was the wrong era and the villains got they're final death wish . And Indy seeing Marion after mutt died during the Vietnam war made them finally come back together and share their love . Indy thank you for doing one last adventure and Harrison ford congratulations on finally doing the last chapter of Indiana Jones.And all the credit goes to George Lucas Steven Spielberg and James mangold for directing Indiana Jones and Kathy for producing Indy .Thank you Lucasfilm Ltd and Disney.","6/10"

"Galina_movie_fan","22 February 2013","I saw ""Life of Pi"" last night and absolutely loved it. I still feel so overwhelmed by it, its visual splendor and the moving story that kept me involved for the whole time. The latest Ang Lee's film is beauty itself, and everyone involved in creation of such sparkling intelligent and classy entertainment deserves the highest praise and admiration for the work they've done. I am sure that in two days, ""Life of Pi"" will receive majority of Oscars it is nominated for. It deserves them.I hesitated to see it because I did not think that the movie about a boy and a tiger stuck together in the middle of the ocean for months after the horrible shipwreck on the drifting lifeboat which the ferocious tiger first claimed as his territory and a makeshift inflatable raft chained to it which was Pi's fragile shelter would be so compelling and gripping but it was. Roger Ebert said that Life of Pi is ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I gladly agree with that. I simply can't find anything wrong with ""Life of Pi."" It is beautiful, profound and adventurous story of survival and understanding life with all it offers or throws at us. It is life affirming even though it takes us along with Pi Patel through unspeakable hardship, losses, and deadly danger of indifferent and indomitable forces of nature's elements and wild creatures. And it manages to say a lot about faith and God without being over-simplistic, preachy or shoving religion in your face. It may help an atheist to understand the believers better or at least to try. It also turns itself in unexpected direction when we thought we were in the end of the journey, reflects on the darkest corners of human nature and leaves the viewers asking questions on what they really want to believe and whether they are open to the possibility of miracle in life, in their lives. It is up to the viewers to choose the answer only they would be satisfied with.Peaceful beauty of Pondicherry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story. Well, it is coming of age story but amazing on so many levels, spiritual, ethical, physical, religious, humanistic, testing the limits of what a human being can deal with and how it would shape him, his life, and his perception of life. This is an experience, both movie watching and afterthought that will stay with me. What else can I ask for in a movie? I've always respected and admired Ang Lee and found his movies exquisite. But ""Life of Pi"" is without doubt his best work. Furious tiger, brave boy, magic journey, fascinating story - amazing movie.","8/10"
"gallsinfrastructuremgr","17 January 2019","So I have been watching Dragon ball since I was a kid. Huge fan watched all series though multiple times. However, this movie had great action, story, etc... no complaints there. However my issue is that they didn't account or care about past cannon knowledge.1. We are aware Frieza requested Vegeta to be brought to him and Vegeta blamed Frieza for making him into the person he was... left out... also made kid vegeta seem bratty and annoying unlike the flashbacks in the series in which he respected his people and father and was proud to be the prince of all sayians.2. Bardock was given the ability to see the future he knew Frieza was going to destroy Vegeta and knew Goku would defeat him. Not mentioned or covered.3. Goku was sent to earth to wipe it clean for sale, even Raditz noted it would fetch a good price... and noted Goku was sent there with instructions to wipe itn and he lost his memory. However we have in this movie a superman type send off by his parents and not as a normal job as originally depicted in the series noting earth as not worth anything.4. Goku was born the same time as vegeta and broly had a decent power level here hes weak and a possible late bloomer. Granted he was low class but they seemed to make it worse.5. During the fight Vegeta is fighting at God level and having issues with Goku able to jump in at that point and handle Broly at normal state... that was a crock...6. Vegeta has the ability to go SSBE he never does this... its a level Goku as we know hasn't reached... and as we know before the movie he can't and hasn't went UI again. So Vegeta should have out classed Goku in terms of power.Perhaps I am a stickler for details but little things like that bother me... but as stated other than these oversights it was a good movie.","8/10"

"garethvk","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

"gariastn","17 February 2023","Ant-man and the Wasp is a decent outing for Scott Lang and company. Its a fun movie but feels a little bloated even though at 124 mins it's not an especially long movie.Some of the humour feels forced and unoriginal. It tries to be goofy and a serious scifi adventure flick at the same time but struggles to get the balance right.However for hardcore MCU fans, it teases an intriguing new villain. Kang's backstory feels a little muddled but perhaps it will be fleshed out appropriately in future outings.Jonathan Majors is so compelling as a villain that he deserves a standalone feature.This new phase of the MCU focuses on the stories and characters of the quantum world and sets up Ant-Man as a central protagonist of this phase of the MCU.","6/10"
"garyhvizdak","31 October 2013","Live of Pi was so bad that I'm at a loss as to how to review it. Here's a list of a few things that were wrong with this production.The way the story was told (as a flashback over dinner) could not have been more boring.Filling the blackboard at school with digits added absolutely nothing to the story line and seemed like an afterthought.All scenes with animals looked totally fake, including Pi's initial interactions with the tiger.Pi's behavior on the boat deck during the storm made no sense and seemed like an LSD trip.None of Pi's actions on the raft made any sense. It seemed as if he did everything he possibly could to ensure that he would not survive.Nothing about the island made any sense.In summary, it is as if everyone involved with this movie from start to finish was on drugs the entire time. There's really no other plausible explanation as to how something so bad could have ever seen the light of day.","8/10"
"gatorgus48","5 June 2023","Way too much CGI. It's overwhelming and distracting. Probably just as well because the dialogue was poor.The actor who played Kang was the only good thing about the movie. However, he has to be one of the dumbest 'supervillains' on screen.Why didn't he just take off their suits when he had captured them? Or even just kill them. But no, he had to 'Doctor Evil' it.In addition, the idea he didn't notice a million fricken ants in his domain is absurd.Further, why he could build that huge empire but couldn't figure out how to shrink the power source without her is also absurd.And Kang was somehow able to get away from a million ants, but couldn't beat Paul Rudd in a fight.The dialogue was atrocious and making Michael Douglas look young was well done, but disturbing in an odd way.I feel it actually made me dumber for having watched it.","1/10"
"gavin6942","24 February 2013","A young man (Suraj Sharma) who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger (Richard Parker). Let me first say that I am glad that M. Night Shyamalan did not end up directing this film. Could he have made it successful? Possibly. But, he does have a stigma attached to him that Ang Lee does not have. Lee may not be a critically-heralded director, but he is not a running joke, either. And after this film, he may start getting more offers.Lee says in making this film, he had to ""disguise a philosophical book as an adventure story"". Although I have not read the book, this sounds spot on. The concepts presented are certainly religious, or at least spiritual, and there is always the feeling that there is more going on than the parts we can see with our eyes.Roger Ebert called the film ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I will grant that it was excellent storytelling, and would need at least two viewings to fully appreciate. The visual mastery is a bit harder for me to get behind. Some of the visuals are spectacular, while others I felt never quite seemed real enough. Technology has come a long way, but I still know a fake tiger when I see one.The story works great, and carries itself in three stages. (Here is where the spoilers start, so stop now if you have not seen it.)The first stage is the overt religious and spiritual stage. Once we get past the jokes about ""Piscine Patel"", we see a brief exploration of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Certainly nothing thorough, but we get the idea of how we can approach the world seeing one god as many, or many gods as one, and not find it to be contradictory. If the film is going to convince us to believe in God, we have to join him on this quest. (I suspect it goes deeper in the book.)The second stage is during the days at sea. We have the reference to Richard Parker, here a name for a tiger but also the name of a classic shipwrecked sailor. In some ways, the story here parallels that of the real-life sailor and the Parker from the Edgar Allen Poe story. We also have the introduction of ""Tsimtsum"". I did not know the term while watching the movie, but felt it must have been important. (Why a Japanese ship had a Hebrew name is anyone's guess.) I now know it is a Kabbalah term about God's being simultaneously transcendent and within the world. A concept that is both contradictory and necessary. It also explains how Pi survives...The third stage is the last few minutes, when we hear the parallel story about the cannibalistic cook. Is this the real story? Is it a metaphor for the other story, which was actually the true story? Is either one true? And ultimately, does it matter? Here, after we are immersed in faith for two hours, we are left to decide: which is the true story, and does it matter which? (With Pi the only survivor, any story he creates will be the only story that will be recorded as the true story -- he has essentially created his own world.)","9/10"
"gavinp9","15 February 2023","'Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania' (or Ant-Man 3) is the thirty-something-th MCU film, but it's always good to see Paul Rudd back as Scott Lang - he brings the right level of charm and goofball-ness, balanced with his determination and morality. Good to see the one director get to do all three films in a trilogy, with a few nods back to the original film (now 8 years ago!).""QuANTuMANia"" follows the combined family - Scott, Hope (Lilly), daughter Cassie (Newton), Hope's Mum Janet (Pfeiffer) & Dad Hank (Douglas) - as they're sucked into the quantum realm and try to get their way back to Earth. I like the concept of the quantum realm - no-one to call for help, existing outside of space & time, lots of exotic things/creatures + it looks cool with all the CGI! They're sucked into a war that they didn't know Janet had been part of and we get to meet Kang The Conqueror (Majors), who looks like being the new Thanos for the next series of MCU films.There's some similarities to the Star Wars sequels, especially with the ""aliens"", otherworldly colours/settings and the final act. But, as with the other two Ant-Man films (this might be better than the 2nd one), Hank Pym (the real Ant-Man) & Hope (the Wasp) are the real unsung heroes. All the actors get something to do, there's a few good cameos, but nothing too substantial and the film doesn't always go where you expect. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing.Overall: Another solid entry, great visuals and satisfying ending.","8/10"
"gavinp9","2 July 2023","'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' (or Indiana Jones 5) comes 42 years after the original, and while not in the same league as 'Raiders' or 'Last Crusade', it is up there with 'Temple of Doom'. This film is directed by Mangold ('Logan' and 'Ford v Ferrari'), who knows how to film a car/train chase. This time, it's 1969 and we have an older Indy (Ford) trying to find the eponymous ""dial"" (more like an ancient ballerina box) with his goddaughter, Helena (Waller-Bridge).She brings some good humour and a nice presence to balance Indy, as well as another pre-teen offsider, Teddy (Ididore), while Voller (Mikkelsen) and Klaber (Holbrook) are good as the modern-day Nazi bad guys. There's a few slow moments early on (aside from the opening train scene), but the film really hits it's stride in the 2nd & 3rd acts.As with most Indiana Jones films, you have to suspend a bit of disbelief, but the plot-point for the final act is pretty dumb. There's a few cameos, the iconic score from John Williams, some good wise-cracks and a mostly-satisfying ending. Mostly though, it feels comfortable and a mostly-exciting adventure film, as it should be.","6/10"
"gavinp9","24 January 2019","'Dragon Ball Super: Broly' is a sequel/continuation/reboot of the 'Dragon Ball' TV series and the two most recent films, 'Battle of Gods' and 'Resurrection F'. Like those, it's like slipping back into comfy pajamas - Goku (Schemmel)'s still funny and righteous, Vegeta (Sabat)'s still got a chip on his shoulder and Frieza (Ayers) is still out for universal domination. Starts with a good backstory of the Saiyans on their planet and how/why Broly (Mignogna) and his father, Paragus (Clarke) are exiled.Not much for secondary characters to do, but we still see Trunks, Bulma, Beerus and Piccolo. Once we've established Frieza's hand in turning Broly bad and bringing them to Earth, it's up to Goku and Vegeta to stop the 'legendary Super Saiyan'. From there, it's pretty much a massive battle scene for the final 30min.As in the series and films, there animation is excellent, the soundtrack's fast, there's plenty of ""powering-up"" and close-ups and enough jokes thrown in to provide levity. It's fun to see new levels of 'Super Saiyan' and their respective colours and the changes in fighting styles these bring. Nothing groundbreaking, but a good ending and decent story.","8/10"
"gavinp9","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","9/10"
"gbanoon","1 June 2023","Without spoiling anything I just want to give a brief summary about this movie and how it is mindblowingly good.Just as I thought the last movie was already awesome, I thought this one would be as good or less. But it surpassed my expectations in an excellent way. This is the magnum opus of all animation in my opinion. It just combines so many different styles in one coherent movie, with an excellent story, cast and performances. I really was disappointed by the huge cliffhanger in the end, in a good way. Definitely going to rewatch this movie very soon, there are so many layers to this movie. In my opinion you can't fully appreciate what's on screen with just one watch, you need to see it multiple times to really let it sink in. This is definitely a highlight of the movies I watched this year so far.","10/10"
"gcarpiceci","2 May 2018","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...
So I'll go now, I have some work to do tonight to try and digest this nuclear pizza....","1/10"
"geislekm","15 March 2020","For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because ""it's computer generated'"". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.
Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.
Oscars, make a new category for CGI actors!","7/10"
"gelmcchristop","21 December 2020","I am surprised in a positive way by how well an action trilogy has evolved, and the final part did not disappoint me. Acceptable and in some sequences admirable directing-editing choices, accompanied by above solid cinematography, with amazing sets and balanced colors. The visual effects were (naturally for the trilogy) stunning, yet even here they outdid themselves, with probably some of the best explosions we've seen on screen. Honorable mention is the script of the movie. Despite the fact that the military stuff was obviously overlooked to let the rest of the movie flow, they succeeded in that goal, without getting the viewer disengaged. And for the best part, as dystopian movies go, War for the Planet of the Apes is clearly and overlooked one: won't go over spoilers here, i'll just say it presents some successfully blurred lines between right and wrong, making you wonder what the ""good ending"" should be.
Last thing I would like to point out, I do not see why people are getting all political about this-it's near a masterpiece, so please do not let any opinions of that nature ruin the experience for you.","7/10"
"genderarm","2 August 2019","There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing.","10/10"
"generationofswine","29 April 2019","Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with.","10/10"
"GenghisKhan69","19 January 2024","If you are looking for a fun, fast-paced, and furious action movie, you might want to check out The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham as a former special agent who becomes a vigilante after his friend is scammed by a ruthless tech mogul. The movie is directed by David Ayer, who knows how to deliver explosive set pieces and gritty violence, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who adds some clever twists and witty dialogue to the formulaic plot.The movie is essentially a showcase for Statham's charisma and skills, as he plays a man who lives a quiet life as a beekeeper in the countryside, until his friend and mentor falls victim to a phishing scheme that drains her life savings. Here Jason Stathams character then embarks on a mission to track down and punish the culprits responisble leading to a hive of concpiracies and plot twists.The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should the audience. The plot is full of holes and implausibilities, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the dialogue is often cheesy and clichéd. However, the movie also has a sense of humor and self-awareness, and does not shy away from poking fun at its own absurdity and genre conventions. The movie also delivers on the action front, with plenty of shootouts, chases, fights, and explosions, all staged with flair and energy by David Ayer.Statham is in his element, as he dispatches his enemies with style and efficiency, while also displaying some emotional range and vulnerability in certain scenes. The supporting cast is also solid, with Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson hamming it up as the villains, and various supporting casts adding some warmth and depth to the story.The movie is not without its flaws, and it is certainly not for everyone. Some viewers might find it too violent, too silly, or too predictable. However, for fans of Statham and action movies in general, The Beekeeper is a satisfying and entertaining ride that will keep you buzzing for 90 minutes. It is the best kind of bad movie, one that knows what it is and what it wants to be, and delivers on its promise. The Beekeeper is a honey of an action movie, and you might want to give it a try.","7/10"

It's not the years; it's the mileage - personified - with Ford giving his swan song as the titular, globe-trotting archaeologist with this rousing, rip-roaring return to form for the franchise as his retiring professor is reunited with his goddaughter (flinty & feisty Waller-Bridge giving as good as it gets) facing Nazis (them again!) when an ancient artifact is sought after by an old foe of Indy's (Mikkelsen dryly perfectly cast) which may change history as we know it. Set circa 1969 with set pieces and grand chases from WWII Europe to NYC to Sicily to Morocco and clever CGI de-aging for Ford in the opening salvo as well as some touchstones from the past (hello Sallah!) Kinetically directed by James Mangold (who co-scripted with Jez Butterworth, Joh-Henery Butterworth and David Koepp) the film slam bangs with precision and verve. Ford's iconic hero is given a shot of pathos, vulnerability, gravitas and finally, reverence which is all any one could want for in the long run.","1/10"

"GeorgeStrCy89","7 February 2019","First of all I must say this is probably the best dragon ball movie. It satisfies those who know about the events taking place before this movie, and also those who have no idea about it and never watched anything dragon ball related in the past.Now to enter the movie, I can separate it in two parts: a) the story and b) the fight. I believe I haven't seen any dragon ball movie in the past with such a crazy and long fight, what was great about it was the fact that I didn't feel bored at any moment. Of course in order to make the fight have sense they had to start the film with the events that took place decades ago. Maybe the power levels didn't make sense at some point but I can understand they wanted to show little bit of everything, it's also a bit crazy how Broly manages to adapt so fast, to Super Saiyan God and Blue while he was in base form for so long (imagine this guy achieving God and Blue powers). I am happy they rebooted such a fan favorite character like Broly, for those who'd seen Dragon Ball Super series will probably know there is a character similar with Broly from another universe, but this one looks much more promising (and already more loved). For those who just saw this movie and have no idea about the Super series, let me tell you something, you should go and watch it, especially the tournament of power arc. Do you remember in this movie when Goku said ""Tournament of power opened my eyes""? in that tournament he managed to awake a far more greater power, yes all the core fans know what I'm talking about! In this movie they didn't show anything about it (and there is reasoning behind it) but I believe they just wanted to introduce Broly in the series. The thing I liked the most about the movie was the ending (after the end of this crazy fight), it felt like a promise we will see a lot more from Broly in the future. One thing I couldn't imagine was that maybe we will get to see Broly fight alongside Goku and the rest of the gang since Goku is willing to help Broly becoming stronger (if possible), and also train with him to achieve even greater power and possibly reach his limits too.Before I finish this review, I wanted to say one more thing. I have a question for my ""beloved"" critics. I know it's your job to always try to find something negative to say about anything, well since I read the last few weeks some of you called this Japanese THING nonsensical, well how much sense can it have when it's science fiction? I highly doubt that you have any idea about dragon ball, did you watch the series before this movie? Hope you will enjoy the movie!","10/10"
"georgetbarber","2 June 2023","Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.","8/10"
"georgewhittingham1","28 June 2023","I've just left the cinema feeling slightly underwhelmed, and very confused.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels in many ways, like an old Indiana movie.It's wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in his best role, even if he does look far too old to be undertaking even half the things in the film.There's some solid nostalgia and references to the old films, with a few old characters popping up, and our new characters actually did a pretty good job. Mads Mikklesen, is an ok villain, if not very shallow, but personally the star is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who shines throughout giving us constant jokes with a cheeky smile.The score was brilliant as to be expected, which accompanies car chases, ancient ruins, action scenes and all the rest. The humour is on point, it's never boring, and everything moves at a very steady pace.The first 3/4 of the movie are pretty great, and at this point I would have probably given it a 7/7.5 out of 10.But... the ending of the film is just confusing, and very underwhelming. I won't obviously give anything away, but my wife and I both said we'd really appreciate a 20 minute YouTube video explaining what on earth happened, and how did they get there?It's worth a trip to the cinema, and great to see Indiana back on our screens one final time, but it will leave you feeling rather empty inside. 6.5 / 10.","2/10"

"gettodamoofies","30 May 2023","FILM: 5.5/10.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unfortunately falls victim to a tired formula, representing a weak start to Phase Five. While the first Ant-Man film introduced a refreshing comedic twist to the superhero genre, and the second had its moments despite a dip in quality, this third entry feels like a regurgitation of familiar ideas without any significant innovation.One of the main drawbacks of Quantumania is its heavy reliance on non-stop CGI spectacle at the expense of a quality script. The film bombards viewers with over-the-top action sequences that quickly become exhausting, leaving little room for character development or meaningful storytelling.However, there are a few bright spots in the film. Jonathan Majors delivers a standout performance as Kang, displaying his range and talent. However, recent personal matters surrounding the actor may potentially jeopardize the character's inclusion in upcoming MCU entries, which is a concern for fans of the franchise.On a positive note, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly enjoy increased screen presence, and their performances are commendable. Their chemistry helps to inject some much-needed life into the film, even if the overall product falls short.Unfortunately, the portrayal of M. O. D. O. K., a formidable Marvel villain, fails to translate effectively from the page to the screen. The character lacks the depth and menace that fans have come to expect, resulting in a missed opportunity to create a compelling antagonist.Curiously, the design and plot similarities to the Star Wars prequels are hard to ignore, as is the inclusion of several Star Wars cast members. While some may appreciate the homage and cross-pollination, it feels like a distraction and adds little value to the overall narrative.Despite the charm and charisma brought by Paul Rudd and the standout performance by Jonathan Majors, these factors alone are not enough to offset the criticisms of the film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania falls short of its predecessors and fails to deliver a fresh and engaging addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.Native 4K presentationDetail level: ExcellentColour reproduction: ExcellentLevel accuracy: GoodEncode: ExcellentMaster condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 8/10.Dolby Atmos audioDialogue reproduction: ExcellentSoundtrack & effects clarity: ExcellentDynamics: GoodSurround sound presentation: ExcellentLFE content: ModerateMOOFIEMETER: 6/10.","5/10"

From data mining senior citizens to political king making it is clear evidence that the American society is on it's way to being the next to fall off the cliff.Could there be a solution to that? Could Beekeepers be an answer? You will absolutely enjoy finding out.","8/10"

"glennmeerten06","15 February 2023","Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.","7/10"
"glofau","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.","10/10"
"glorifcus","22 February 2023","Jonathan majors as kang is a joy to see. Michelle pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly step up to the challenge having amazing moments. The film ending is somewhat lackluster, also its introduction to ideas and characters that never develop rightfully drag the pace and momentum. Also the performance by actress Kathryn newton is unfortunately one of the dragging moments on screen: not convincing and plenty of occasions forceful. Paul Judd as the so called ""small guy with room to grow"" is good, but not amazing that will blow the audience away in the titular role. The film has several ideas that surely the marvel cinematic universe will come back to pick up and use, lets hope that they will un due time will have their time to have enough room up grow.","7/10"

The whole set up for these bad guys is unreal (cia backing him?) and the innocents dying is unacceptable. SOBs did enough killing so now we need to see nice old woman shot in back running away to prove they are evil? Know it all god daughter and her half mustached pick pocket punk did nothing to add to the story, neither likable or believable. (yeah, I can drive a scooter and fly a plane...at the same time!!!) Oh, and when shot I am pretty sure you don't want to go skydiving, and how is it again nazi boy figured out they were heading to Sicily, going west?

"gmoorehe","18 July 2017","I really liked the 1st movie and enjoyed the 2nd so figured the 3rd would be a good ending except they forgot to write a story. This film is 140 minutes long -- with at least 45 minutes too many of ape closeups, or should I say CGI closeups. The sad thing is they could have soared with the 3rd installment but instead made a $150 million dud. Soldiers with modern lethal weapons against apes with spears - just crazy. And the moral of the story, well there really wasn't one except all the human soldiers good and bad got killed while a remnant of apes survived along with a mysterious young girl who joined the apes. I think I would have preferred something where the conflict rises to a crescendo and then ends with a fragile peace with apes and humans learning to live together, not separate. Alas, the ""authors"" decided that apes and humans can't live together. Let's hope there is never another plant of the apes, ever.","1/10"
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","15 July 2017","What has fascinated me about this trilogy is how it explores the idea of humanity through the eyes of an animal learning to become human. Each film has its lead Caesar overcoming a certain emotional obstacle and in this final chapter we see him go up against his greatest one yet: himself.When we enter War, we feel that the world has gotten bleaker since the end of Dawn. The humans of compassion and fairness like Will and Malcolm from the previous films no longer exist. The last of human society are now just military fanatics who see that the apes must either be wiped out or enslaved to ensure their own survival. Like past Ape films, War can be seen as a dark reflection of upon our own society from enslaved and abused apes resembling Holocaust victims to the Colonel drawing inspiration from real power-hunger fanatical leaders like Hitler to Trump whom lead a legion of blind, faithful followers. Despite its title, War is actually less focused on explosive battles but more on the internal battle within ourselves, whether you're an ape or human. Director Matt Reeves shows how war can dehumanize the compassionate by examining Caesar's emotional arc through the story. After a tragic incident, we see Caesar change from being the merciful leader we know him as to an individual on a path of revenge who begins distancing himself from his loved ones and his own humanity. We question if he can return to being the ape he once was to lead his people or end up destroying himself like his former ally Koba. In contrast, the human villain the Colonel is someone who has allowed the war to strip away all of his humanity, compassion and mercy to ensure that Caesar's race won't subjugate his own by whatever means necessary. As the story progresses, we even see that both sides end up turning on themselves out of desperation and fear.While War is the darkest of trilogy, it does offer some lightness to the bleak tone. The characters like Maurice the orangutan and the mute human child Nova offer an emotional anchor that keeps Caesar from losing his humanity all at once. Maurice acts as Caesar's conscious to ensure he won't end up hurting himself and anyone else unnecessarily. Nova shows to be the only human that has actual humanity thanks to her innocence and bond with Maurice. And a big surprise is Steve Zahn's new character Bad Ape who doesn't just to exist to be a joke in the film but offers necessary levity and proves to be very instrumental in the journey of the apes.Regardless if Andy Serkis finally gets that Oscar nomination next year for his mo-cap role as Caesar, he has still proved he is one of the greatest actors working today. Serkis does not need words to show you the mental state of Caesar. You see that in his final role as Caesar he gives the best performance of his career as he puts every thought and care into how Caesar expresses himself including dark aspects you have never before seen. And the dynamic between him and Woody Harrelson as the Colonel offers some of the best scenes in the film. While he may seem like the film's version of Colonel Kurts from Apocalypse Now at first, Harrelson goes beyond what you expect of him as a usual villain and shows a layer of complexity and emotion that is beyond what I expected. In Dawn, Matt Reeves stepped in to take over what Rupert Wyatt started with. Here he shows more creative control in this then in Dawn (which is nothing against it). As I said before, Reeves is more much invested in character's motivations and decisions then action but that doesn't stop from him making it look rough and gritty. And he lets the visuals and character's emotions guide the story instead of dialogue exposition. Moments with no music let you feel the emotion and sense of isolation that surrounds the characters. And the music by the way is probably the best of Michael Gianchino's work that I have heard yet.And what can I say about the visuals. WETA has now made me completely forget I am watching a cgi character. The way the apes's skin and fur reflects and absorbs light and the snow dripping from their faces definitely says War will be winning a lot of visual effects awards in the near future. Aside from stunning cgi, other visuals that should be taken notice are the cinematography shots from Michael Seresin. As Caesar's group travel across the post-apocalyptic wilderness, the shots of the haunting but yet stunning and beautiful landscapes show how bleak the world is. And we feel how menacing the forces of nature really are.War for the Planet of the Apes may not only be the best entry in one of the best trilogies ever made but may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found such a difficult time finding a flaw in this film. It brings Caesar's journey to ensure his people's place as the next rulers of the planet to a fitting and emotional close with lots of tears being shed. War for the Planet of the Apes is hands down a masterpiece.","10/10"
"gogojirago","2 January 2013","I read ""Life of Pi"" a couple of years ago while I was touring around Europe and I found it to be a mildly-entertaining book which touched lightly on the philosophical side. It was no surprise to me then, when I discovered Ang Lee's faithful film adaptation to be exactly that - mildly entertaining, touching lightly on the philosophical side.I believe a lot of people came to watch this movie with many different expectations, from those who wanted to watch a realistic sea-survival movie, contrasted by those who believed it would offer something truly deep and significant philosophically. Both these camps will be disappointed. As Jonathan Romney says in the IOS review ""Life of Pi is fatally scuppered by coy, bogus mysticism."" Conversely, as you will read on the message boards here at IMDb (spoilers abound there, be forewarned!) a lot of people couldn't even handle the philosophy-lite that was on offer and were ""disappointed"" that it wasn't the straight- forward boy-lost-at-sea-with-a-tiger story it falsely claimed to be (*deep breath*). Hey everybody, this film will not change your life. It will provide you with some inoffensive entertainment for a couple of hours, and probably little more.""Life of Pi"" - whether in book-form or in this adaptation - is neither high art, nor gruelling adventure. What it actually is is a fantasy story, framed at the edges with a smidgeon of realism in an attempt to add a soupçon of depth and food-for-thought. Approach the film as such and you may well enjoy it. As a heavily CGI-ed film it provides at times a stunning visual work. Again reviewers have been mixed, some claiming that the over-playing of visuals falls into the garish, and attempts to wash over the philosophical shallowness of the movie. Well, CGI is the trend today; it has some benefits, but the overall effect of digitally rendering your characters and sceneries is bound to leave something missing soul-wise. ""Life of Pi"" is pretty enough to look at, but personally I think much more could and would have been made of it if it was adapted as an (classic style) animation.I'd mark the film as 6.5 (it made my partner cry), but I'm rounding down this time because of the sudden wave of sycophancy present on IMDb, meaning that every film that comes out has 8-point-something (corporate presence?). Either way, a pleasant break from Hollywood aggression, and worth a watch.","8/10"
"goharddamnit","2 May 2019","I love Marvel Movies, I thought Infinity war was the best superhero movie ever and Thanos the best villain ever. I rated Infinity War with an absolute 10.But lets talk about this one. The expectations were very high of course, thanks to the first masterpiece.But this one has so many plot holes that it is ridiculous. I ll start with the movie itself first though.The pacing of the movie is slow and what I saw in the theaters does not justify 3 hours. They dragged it so muchThe fight scene happens in the end and there is no time to showcase each hero efficiently. Infinity was great because there was correct pacing and enough screen time for most heroesThey destroyed Thor's character. Thor is willing to sacrifice his life to avenge the deaths of his loved ones in Infinity War and he is so powerful with Stormbreaker that he nearly succeeds in killing Thanos. Yet when 2014 Thanos comes in, bearing no stones, Thor with BOTH Stormbreaker and Mjolnir is nothing for him. Man, how can you not consider this when making the movie?Hulk 100% sidelined once again. He is the original, strongest Avenger (or among the 2). Disappointing.Time traveling scenes are nothing more than references and fan service, no substanceCaptain marvel strong arms Thanos! Really? He might not be able to snap his fingers but he still has the power of the stones running through his body. He doesn't have to grab a stone with his left hand!Natasha's death was not dramatic. It was brushed off as humor! Terrible, just terrible.How anti-climatic to end the movie with a snap from Stark. I get it, contracts are over and stuff but that was weak for my tasteNow the many plot holes that sucked me out of the movie:The traveling back in time is an epiphany that they suddenly all inherently know the rules. Effortlessly. It doesn't feel earned. But lets forget that for a moment.The pim particle is used to timetravel 1 person. They were traveling in groups to the same timeline so, if it was possible to timetravel a whole gigantic ship with 1 particle like 2014 Nebula did, you would think that our heroes would use just 1 per group. Bu no. Our heroes use 1 per person. Thanos uses 1 for a freaking army.2014 Nebula can teleport that whole army with her hands doing that magic. So, 2019 Nebula could not? She is a better enhanced version of her 2014 self by definition!!!Nebula never tells them before hand that Thanos might be there BEFORE they go thereThe Soul Stone. Oh boy. Nebula knows what needs to be done to get it. She once again tells no one! Plus, the whole point is that you have to sacrifice your true love to get it! Not race with your friend on who gets to kill himself first! Clint didn't kill Natasha. He tried to save her. And she was not his true love, like Gamora was to Thanos.They do not want to create different timelines but they do. Thanos no longer exists in that past timeline as he gets killed prematurely, 5 years earlier. This means that he is not there to take those same actions as before, go after the stones, send people for the stones, do the snap. Nothing.Captain Marvel can fly in space. Yet, she takes the gauntlet and tries to fly through the battlefield! Just take it and fly away damn it! Fly over them!They send Captain America back with all the infinity stones, in a briefcase, all by himself!! Do you know how many villain can take a briefcase from Captain America????!!! IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSECaptain America goes back once for all stones. These were taken from different timelines. He should have traveled 4 distinct times, not 1. This in not 1 timeline from which all the stones are missing. These are 4 distinct timelines.Captain America doesn't use the pim particle to come back. It is implied that he ends up near the lake naturally, he stayed back, leaved his life and aged. So, this means that he ended up in this timeline, which can't happen! He is in a different timeline, in the past!!!!!! This definitely wont lead to the same events, nothing as we know it. He can't just jump between timelines without the particle so that he meets Hulk and the others here! Just think about it for a sec!In this timeline the snap has happened. In Captain's new timeline, there are 2 captain America's first of all! But we are not meddling with time lines and stuff.I have more but I think I made my point.","6/10"

"GomezAddams666","19 February 2023","Let me start by saying that I truly loved this movie, many have said it overuses CGI, but the way I see it this movie called for it given it takes place in the Quantum Realm, not to mention the CGI is fantastic.The cast is great as always. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have great chemistry, and I did enjoy how malevolent Jonathan Mayors plays Kang, but he also gives him a hint of Royalty with his demeanor. The story is also great, outside of Hawkeye this is one of the most lighthearted stories post Avengers: Endgame, which is okay. But the real stand-out of the movie is Cassie Lang.I think Kathryn Newton is a great addition to the MCU, her portrayal of Cassie is flawless, she portrays her both very badass and emotional.This is a great movie to kick start Phase V, I can't wait to see what comes next.","6/10"
"gondiken","18 May 2023","I'll start with a few positives: The idea of entire universes at the subatomic level is very exciting and the cosmetic choices to establish the rules of these universes are well made. The cast is excellent and I've found CGI to be at a good level (considering the amount of CGI that had to be packed into a completely new realm, one or two weird glitches are fine).But the story is written horribly. There is an obscene amount of circumstantial events, multiple characters behave in the way that makes no sense considering their backstory, on several occasions the previously established events from previous movies are ignored, and the expectation of an impending danger in the Phase 5 does not live up to the level we'd expect from Marvel.People interested in storytelling will definitely find themselves thinking of dozens of alternative directions the writers could have gone with this material, because the idea of a quantum realm is incredibly interesting. Just for that, I finished the movie feeling inspired. But none of this feeling can be attributed to the writers of this movie.","7/10"
"Gordon-11","1 December 2012","This film is about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck while cruising the Pacific Ocean. The twist is that there is a tiger on his lifeboat.The film tells a tale of survival, of how Pi has to battle the treacherous ocean and at the same time fear for the ferocious tiger. His constant battles to survive is engagingly presented, as each challenge is so real. It's amazing how desperate situations can bring another side out of us. As the plot continues, something feels not so right, until the twist comes that everything makes sense again. This twist serves not only to surprise and entertain, but adds a whole new dimension to ponder upon. The struggles presented initially all pales in comparison. It's intensely moving. After watching the film, I felt tingles around my body because the emotional cascade lingers on.","10/10"
"Gordon-11","15 February 2023","This film tells the story of Ant Man and his family entering the Quantum realm, causing a lot of adventures and dangers to ensue.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is visually impressive, as there are multiple fantasy science fiction worlds to depict. The imagination runs wild with some of the unearthly characters. The story appears to me rather flat, but that is perhaps due to my lack of love for fantasy realms. To me, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" looks more like a fantasy film than a superhero film. I am not able to relate to the characters or their world. I would have preferred a superhero film to be set in a relatable world.","1/10"

One day, his family have an accident while they sail. Only he survives with Richard Parker. The graphics in this film is beautiful very much. I was overwhelmed by the scene of a whale and island. This story was different with my expectation, therefore, the development was surprising for me. I felt that I wanted to know how did Richard Parker think to Pi. I want everyone to watch this film. Some people write say that the original writes scene which the movie does not write. Therefore I should also read the original.","5/10"

"grace98","21 November 2012","I gave this film 10/10 because it is really touching and lets people think about things around us. I didn't expect it that good since I haven't read the book. Probably Ang Lee's directing made me want to see how it works, but it turned out very amazing. The film is not perfect, you can see some goofs in it. It is a sight feast in terms of pictures. The whole story and journey that Pi had been through is well told, and at last Pi told a different story, which really made me think about things around us. Many times what we believed is perhaps not the truth...but when we find something that is worth to believe, we shouldn't let it go even if we may lose everything we cared about, they will come back eventually...Anyway, it is really a good movie, worth to watch!","9/10"
"gradyharp","13 March 2013","As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story. Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: 'In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar, Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments Gérard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better. Grady Harp","9/10"
"gradyharp","18 August 2018","Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........
There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.

This is effectively Part 1 of the sequel to Into the Spider-Verse.The massive world(s) is(are) explained and explored at a beautiful pace that doesn't feel too beat you over the head expositiony.The first Spiderverse had a relatively small budget of 90million which it used to great effect. This movie looks like it has a 200million dollar budget. It's actually only 100million but with their experience from the first movie they've made great strides in squeezing beauty out of dollars especially when accounting for inflation.Across the Sider-Verse is the Tears of The Kingdom to Into the Spider-Verse's Breath of the Wild.","10/10"

Yes, the visual effects are amazing, but is so much more than Ang Lee showing off his cinematographic prowess. The story is very emotional, and quite unique as it involves a boy and a tiger. Not only emotional, but spiritual too.Excellent CGI. You would swear there was a real tiger, zebra, hyena etc in the boat with Pi.Solid performances from a cast of unknowns (the only well-known actor in the movie is Gerard Depardieu, and his role is fairly minor). Suraj Sharma is great as Pi.","9/10"
"GreatorexLee","17 January 2024","A a really, really fun film. What I love about The Beekeeper is it feels like a genuine classic action b-movie. The odd dialogue and clunky changes in tone never feel forced or like satire of classic action b-movies. Instead it's a genuinely idiosyncratic movie that provides possibly unintentional comedy along with some great action scenes.I had so much fun watching this and will definitely be buying the DVD when it's out. The perfect movie to watch with a few beers. Some classic clunky social commentary just like many of the second tier action movies of the 80s and 90s. Some fantastic villains too although I would have loved to have seen much more of at least two of them.Good cast! Josh Hutcherson is great in this whilst Jeremy Irons and Minnie Driver are essentially pointless but add character to this strange but highly enjoyable movie.","3/10"
"greggs_nbacon","26 April 2019","After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF. I can't give Avengers:Endgame any grade worse than perfect.(Grade: 10/10)","10/10"
"GregTheStopSign95","17 July 2023","I HATE giving this movie such a low score, mainly because I just adore Paul Rudd and he elevates pretty much everything he's in, but he couldn't lift this one enough for me to really care about it much beyond him. And maybe Corey Stoll. I mean, I'm a BIG fan of Michelle Pfeiffer and have been for years, but she doesn't really have much to work with here, and the same goes for Michael Douglas. I'm also becoming a fan of Kathryn Newton but she, too, is given little to really work with here...and don't get me started on Bill ""WISH version of Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster"" Murray's 2 minutes of screen time.All that aside, the Quantum Realm looks amazing, and I REALLY like the aesthetic choices for Kang, and Jonathan Majors put in a really good performance for the role, but he didn't really feel like much of a threat. Especially not compared to the threat he COULD pose if they adapt him well from the comics. He just felt kinda empty and kinda cookie-cuttery? Considering the issues that have since arisen around Mr Majors, I bet Marvel are kicking themselves that they didn't at least HINT at any versions of Kang that aren't wearing Majors' face...I'm not yet ready to write Marvel off completely, but this mess does have me less willing to blindly throw my money at whatever they release into cinemas.","7/10"
"Gresh854","14 July 2017","From the beginning I heard this series was going to be made I doubted that'd it be successful, even though I was a fan of the 1968 original. Then I saw Rise, and I absolutely loved that film, making me completely invested and insured in the series seriousness. Then I saw Dawn, and I loved that film even more than Rise. And a couple nights ago, I was crossing my fingers hoping that War could complete this trilogy on a high note. Thankfully, I am glad to say that War for the Planet of the Apes, is by far the best Planet of the Apes movie yet. War is by far surprisingly not only the most intriguing of the two movies, but really the most emotional movie of them all. The movie is advertised as a violent war battle between the apes and the humans, and you do get some of that in this movie, but in reality, this movie is about the conflictions in which Caesar is to undergo. The journey that Caesar takes in this movie is what made me love this film. This film is more of a character piece, than it is an action-packed battle. This film takes the time to sacrifice action sequences, for extremely well written scenes, between characters. I don't want to spoil Woody Harrelson's character. All I'm simply going to say is that he is by far the best human character we've had in this franchise. The main issue I had with most of the new Planet of the Ape films were the human characters. They were just fine and they worked for their purpose, but Harrelson's character is very well developed. You get his motivations, and the reason for why he's the way he is. The element that will stay in your head, I think the most for most audiences, is the way the film produces its sentimental sequences. A majority of those sequences really hit me, right in the heart, and that's rare for a modern day film to do that for me, especially a blockbuster. War is by far, one of the best movies I've seen of 2017, and is the perfect conclusion to the best trilogy I've seen since The Dark Knight trilogy. I'd give War for the Planet of the Apes a letter grade of a solid ""A"".","8/10"

"griffolyon12","30 November 2012","Within the first ten minutes, the titular protagonist of Life of Pi, Pi Patel, tells a writer that this story will make one believe in God. The story that Pi tells, is that of a shipwreck, which claims a teenaged Pi's family. Amidst the chaos, he found himself the sole human survivor, now floating across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Part survival story, part rumination about one person's faith and their attempts at understanding why God designed nature to do the things in which it does, Life of Pi is an emotion-filled journey that places the viewer within these events and has them pondering the same questions that the film's lead, newcomer Suraj Sharma, does.In a great many ways, Life of Pi requires an open mind from its viewers. It is not a film about one particular religion, as Pi is a combination Hindu, Catholic, and Muslim. He has always been fascinated by God, whether it be Christ, the many Hindu Gods, or Allah, Pi believes they're all the same. The film does not ask the viewer to believe this same idea as Pi, his beliefs simply serve as the impetus to understanding the gentle, soul-filled character that is Pi Patel, and understand how a 16-year-old boy could survive not just the elements and starvation, but also a man-eating tiger.The set up of the film is filled with life and energy, detailing the source of Pi's name, his fascination with religion, and his loss of innocence, before the ship wrecks and the real story begins -- Pi's journey to understand God. To his immense credit, young actor, Suraj Sharma, manages to hold the film together thanks to his revelatory performance. Sharma is the heart- and-soul of Life of Pi. He has a wide range of emotions that make him believable as a teen pondering such large questions, keeping the viewer engaged rather than allowing their attention span to wane. Which is good, seeing as how Life of Pi gets narratively murky around the midpoint, with some of the confrontations between Pi and nature running together by that point. Thankfully, the thematic ideas are what I feel that Ang Lee and company want the audience to take away from the film, and the emotions and ideas are so strong, it is very easy to overlook its narrative shortcomings.Visually, Life of Pi is a marvel. The animals in the life boat are entirely computer generated, and there are many moments where it is hard to find the glossy edges that CGI leaves behind. As well, director Ang Lee uses visual effects and the camera's depth of field to create a more immersive, dream-like feel. Almost every shot seems to have been digitally altered to make it seem more unreal, to make the water more reflective, to make the sky more beautiful, or to make dream and reality often collide. In particular, the way that the camera was always focused on Pi, with most of the other actors out of focus, it really draws one into Pi's state. However, I cannot figure out why Lee changed the aspect ratio in a few scenes. There is no evidence in the film itself to suggest why, leaving me confused. It's only for two scenes, and both are scenes meant to be emotional beats, and yet the film goes from widescreen to fullscreen to letterbox format. It jars the viewer and takes one out of the filmgoing experience.All in all, Life of Pi is not perfect, but it was a film I do not regret seeing. Thanks to a strong performance from Sharma, marvelous effects work, luscious visuals, and a thematic consistency that never falters in affecting the viewer, Life of Pi is a flawed, yet must see film that will be nominated come Oscar night.I give Life of Pi an 8 out of 10","7/10"
"GrigoryGirl","5 July 2023","This is a deliberate, disgusting destruction of a franchise for political purposes, and it has permanently tainted everyone who was responsible for this atrocity, Bob Iger (the guy who runs Disney) and Kathleen Kennedy, the woman who has overseen the destruction of Willow, Star Wars, and now Indiana Jones, all with the blessing and cheering on from Bob Iger. The film essentially emasculates Indiana Jones, mocking him for being an old man, sadistically so, then his snarky goddaughter comes in and saves the day because she's perfect in everything she does and has never messed up in her life. I guess we should be grateful that the original version of this film never saw the light of day. Reportedly, the original cut had Indy killed off in the past, and Phoebe Waller Bridge (the most overhyped person in Hollywood history at this point) replaced Indy and took over the character permanently. After Lucasfilm showed this version to five different audiences (and who all hated it), they had to reshoot it. And let us not forget James Mangold, who, up to this point, was a respected director who has made some good films. He isn't respected as much as he once was, and his going on Twitter to trash fans and deny the rumors of reshoots (which turned out to be true) made him look petty and childish, and his reputation has taken a huge hit. He is tainted as well for directing this awful, nasty, soulless, sadistic film. This is one of the worst films in Disney history.","10/10"
"Grjas","5 September 2013","This was an outstanding movie that combines solid acting, great photography, outstanding special effects and an interesting plot line. I was puzzled at how the director could make a movie about a boy and a tiger in a boat interesting, but he does that in spades. It is especially interesting to try to determine which scenes with the tiger are real and which are Cgi. Other than looking closely at the eyes, it is often hard to determine. The transitions between real and artificial are so seamless, the tiger feels real throughout. The ending as well is something special and leaves room for your own interpretation.Highly recommended.","10/10"
"grlym-46849","1 February 2024","Stratham was great. The plot was basic but that usually doesn't matter too much in this genre of shows.The biggest distraction was bad acting by support leads. Mainly the fbi lead. She was ok, but was given a horrible script. Usually when profanity count goes up, quality goes way down. Usually in a poor attempt to try and make it scary it the actor seem tougher than they are. Less words could have been used to tell more. But there was no selling that she was truly in charge or tough. It's like they modeled her character off an old nick nolte film. But failed. By the end, I was not really thrown off by the almost comical South African hit squadThe rest is for the 300 wire count

"groundzero-273-397110","25 February 2023","A promising start of Marvel Phase 5, with a few exceptions. The things that I liked in this movie outweighs the things I disliked. The story about Kang and Kang as a character was interesting, even though we did not get that much information about him and his past, yet. I just really hope that the version of Kang that was in this movie did not die. The other Kangs that was introduced in the end did not seem interesting at all. Kang did not really feel that powerful either, at least not as powerful as I thought he would be when he is bragging about how many Avengers he has killed etc. He then get beaten by some ants? What?! It would also had been better if Kang actually killed Ant-Man, or at least some of his family... But I suspect that this version of Kang will be back, more powerful and angrier.The comedy was good, even though they try to much sometimes, but a few things made me laugh very much for a long time. Like the broccoli man and how Michael Douglas acted and talked about it was hilarious. MODOK, or Darren, was also very funny to watch most of the time. I have always liked Ant-Man and Paul Rudd in that role, and he was excellent as usual. They could have cut down on Cassie, like a lot, and given some more time for the Wasp to shine. Cassie was really annoying most of the time, and how did she manage to build that stuff and become an expert in 5 years while still pretty young?The dialogue was kinda bad now and then. Like when Cassie had her speech to the people which was kinda cringe, or when telling Darren not to be, you know, a dic..Overall, I was entertained and liked this movie much more than most of the garbage in Phase 4! I'll give it 7/10!","7/10"
"grumpy-3","11 July 2017","thank God there is one franchise that has not let me down, the third in the apes films carries on what the previous two had done, which is to entertain, excite and move the audience. only pixar has managed to do this with non human main characters. Everything in War is beautiful done, dialogue, effects, photography, music and acting both simian and human. these films have been emotionally rewarding, making you care for the characters, without obvious bad guys, both sides have valid reasons for their actions, there is no black and white, but the grey inbetween as in real life. the work of andy serkis and the cgi guys just seems to be getting better and better, where now it is fully acceptable and believable that the apes are real, living, breathing and dying sentient beings. so far the film of the year.","9/10"

Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero.

"gsanvin","2 July 2023","After Kingdom of the Crystal Skull the series had nowhere to go but up and it certainly did that. If you are a fan of Indiana Jones you should like this one. It's not up there with Raiders or Last Crusade but it made up for the disastrous Crystal Skull. Indiana Jones is at his best fighting Nazis so every angle of that has now probably been checked off.This time most of the action is set in 1969 as Indy is trying to keep the Nazis from obtaining both halves of Archimedes Dial of Destiny with which the Nazis believe they can transport through time to alter the outcome of WWII. Of course we have an evil Nazi scientist, knowing all of Hitler's mistakes, plans to use that knowledge to replace Hitler and create a Nazi reign of 1,000 years, blah, blah, blah.The Nazi angle is a bit worn thin by the 5th film now and there are plot holes they don't even attempt to close up but.... but... set that aside, don't over analyze the thing and enjoy the 2hr long ride, It's worth it!","8/10"

This film is not only the best Dragon Ball film I've ever seen but also the best animation ive ever seen in the franchise. Goku is a character that whenever you need him to pull through he will and it shows throughout the entire franchise this film included. Surprisingly the only part that wasn't 1000% for me was Gogeta he was kind of underwhelming and I enjoyed the other fights a bit more. Broly is an actual character now which is great he actually has a really touching story about his childhood. I do not see this moving out of my top 5 movies of the year.","9/10"

Seeing this movie brought back all the nostalgia and the memories, this is really a diamond to look at in awe, the animation in this movie is so well made, looks so fluent and detailed. It has reignited the kid in me, being glued to the screen and wishing to be in that universe to join its battles. Being now an 29 years old adult, sitting in my chair, wobbling from one side to the other at the theatres, trying not to yell at the screen ""C'mon, let them have it"", i really felt as if i was back to the 5 years old me, cheering for Goku to kick those butts.

Now for the story. The story is a lot More darker then first one and the Gwen Stacys world is so great, and we get More of her backstory, like we all knew it is sad ,but holy cow how sad it.

"ha77y73ad97","2 August 2023","There are very few sequels that come to mind that outperform the original in every way, this one certainly does. Not falling into the trap of bigger is better and throwing uncessercary cameos, fan service and budget at a series that was on a very strong footing. Everything in this movie had a purpose as apart of a trilogy.When they did announce that there was going to be a sequel to Into the Spider-verse I was unsure as that ended in a very finite way almost a cash grab from Sony on the back of the first one. I will eat my words that i was wrong, they seem as though they knew where they wanted both this and 3rd installments to end. The story of where this ended was a prefect place and i truly hope that there are screenings for both the 2nd and 3rd when new installment is released.One of the greatest leap forwards that has come from these 2 movies so far is that the animation is on another level artistically wise. Each of the Spider-men has their own unique style, as there have been tones of response over Spider-Punk and is way of being animated is a stroke of genius. Gwen Staceys world bring ripped straight from the panels of a comic with the watercolour emotion changing backgrounds even down to the last universe they visit. That cannot be understated as one of the best designed worlds in the series, as we are going to pick up from that we are going to be in for a visual treat.The cast yet again is stacked and the team behind the first have certainly built upon adding new actors to the roster and Oscar Issacs is a stand out as always. The Anti-Hero Spider-man is a tough character to take on. Played to perfection! Scary yet sombar, violent yet compassionate and down to his back story these are going to touge at the heart strings to then be hating him for the actions that he takes.As a second chapter in a 3 part story this is a marvel (pardon the pun) ends with everyone wanting more as a true story should. As mentioning before this goes into that very exclusive category along with T2: judgement day, The Two Towers and a personal favourite Sherk 2 to name just a few!","10/10"
"HabibieHakim123","12 June 2023","Best Spider-Man movie ever???, more of like the worst Spider-Man movie i've ever watched, Across The Spider-Verse is indeed fits with the title, it's basically a set up movie for the big finale/battle for the next movie, this movie is just the middle of it, i have so many problem with the film from it being too incredibly long, incredibly slow, and incredibly quiet, i don't know if it's just my theater that the volume of the movie was low but it's just not right, the slowness of the narrative and pacing really bothering me, even the dialogue was so slow that the quiet distance between each line i can hear couple people snoring because how so empty the film is, how boring the movie is, and i'm not blaming them at all, it fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene, the soundtrack was bad and compare to the fire soundtrack of the previous movie there is zero memorable song, the voice acting pissed me off too because how they talk mostly so quitely and so whispery and it also sounds mostly like they have no emotion at all, Across The Spider-Verse is missing a lot of the key part including the OG team with Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker, etc. And i miss the depressed Peter B. Parker and in here he's having a perfect life which is good but not as fun and as engaging of a character anymore, the side villain of this movie was Miguel as Spider-Man 2099 and it didn't work as he was not as cool or as menacing as i expected, so do The Spot unfortunately, the positive was of course the animation was still great, i like both Spider-Man India and Spider-Punk, the action was decent, wasn't really blown away by it, it's quite entertaining, the cameos are fine, but the obvious cameos was very disappointing for me, anyway, Across The Spider-Verse for me was a bad example of a set up movie, a set up movie shouldn't be this long except if you fill it with a boring long narrative that fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene with bland and weak story, weak voice acting, and wrong decisions like this one, Across The Spider-Verse is bad, it's a failure, it's a complete waste of time and it could not be a waste of time if it's execute properly with the runtime, the content, and the story, it could be a less than 2 hours movie of a set up instead of more 30 plus minutes of unnecessary boring content, Into The Spider-Verse was a triumph while Across The Spider-Verse was a blunder, and i have my reason and that's the most important.","5/10"

I've always want to like Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania more than Ant-Man And The Wasp, and definitely not wanted to like it less than the first Ant-Man, and it all came down in the middle, even though in a lot of ways i do like Ant-Man And The Wasp better and sometimes this one better, but all the way through i enjoyed the movie and i can even safely say now after thinking about everything that's going down, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a good if not a great MCU movie in a long time for me, now, did i get the hate?, not really because i do get some of the cheesyness of it, some of the CGI for me if not all of them for everybody, and even though that was my real two problems of the film, besides that, i think the film are mostly great, in terms of the story, characters, and acting for the most part, it's a fun straight forward intense journey that takes place in this weird CGI fest world, and i enjoyed it, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang, Paul Rudd and the rest of his family was good, even Bill Murray have a very pleasant little appearance and performance in the film, but the one that absolutely deserve to be credited is Corey Stoll as MODOK, sure his CGI face wasn't that good and sometimes a bit too much but his performance is amazing and it's pretty caught me off guard, it's nice to see a good MCU movie again after two miss in a row for me (Thor: Love And Thunder and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), and overall Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is a pretty great opening to the new Phase of the MCU.","6/10"

"Hallelujah289","7 May 2019","Mild spoilers ahead.After a while watching ""Avengers: Endgame,"" the conclusion seems foregone and all notion of the unpredictable is lost. From the movie flatlines into a series of resolutions for characters I am not that invested in. I suppose the alternative wouldn't sit well with fans, but somehow the previous Avengers film ""Avengers: Infinity War"" seems like a huge feint. The characters reset to their previous lives (mostly), but without a huge sense of insight into dealing with the type of issues Thanos represented (overpopulation) going forward. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a disappointing non-answer to serious questions which had elevated ""Infinity War"" to something beyond a hero flick. But I don't see how the film's audience could've accepted a darker vision, and overall the writers did a good job with what they had, subverting some superhero tropes (hunky Thor got fat!) and answering some expectations for meaningful deaths. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is enjoyable Marvel fun but too conventional to be rewarding for film-goers wanting something important and lasting to be said. However it is a relief that some of the Marvel heroes have finally ended their franchise potential, and have done so at a good spot. Watch the film to find out who.","2/10"
"haloemile","5 June 2023","This is a spoiler free review: the animation and music in this movie were outstanding! If there was one movie to watch this year, it's this one. Usually movies that have a sequel aren't the good since the first one turns out to be better. But not this one, the the second movie topped its original with flying colors. Highly recommend to anyone even if they aren't a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel. It's a fun movie for anyone to enjoy! In all honesty, the movie had me calling out every cameo/easter egg I could find since it was filled with them. And I never do that for any movie. And if there is anything I could take away from this movie, it's, ""everyone's telling me how my story is supposed to go...nah, imma do my own thing.""","10/10"

"HamChuuuuuuu","24 January 2019","The movie starts with some background story which tries to be kind of poignant and you can feel some empathy with certain characters, but the magic comes later, as soon as the fights begin there is no minute to blink from this point, the animation is really good and quick and it has super colorful and flashy battles. Finally I want to add that there are some flashbacks from the whole series that a true fan will be simply glad. Highly recommended even if you don't like Dragon Ball but like anime in general.","10/10"
"hamed_tgh","31 July 2019","I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode.
It was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better.
The story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time.
Captain Marvel's role was very empty. The character's presence in the film was really wrong.","8/10"

"hani_78696","30 March 2013","Perfect Storytelling and great adaption of a novel which was considered unfilmable before the movie. Ang lee really broke grounds,to the level of avatar. Most visually enriched movie of the year. The magic lies within Special Effects and Cinematography. Great narration by Irrfan Khan as well as Good acting by Suraj Sharma. Not only visually but emotionally satisfying,i broke into tears during the movie and tears of joy in the end. I loved the reference Pi makes about Tiger,Sailor and his Mother to himself ,Zebra and orangutan. It gives us moral ""Never to lose hope and Keep Trying,There will definitely a way out of all problems""","10/10"
"HannahCN","27 February 2022","Yeah, the title is about all I can say about it. I'm not at all a fan of shonen anime. Slice of life, psychological horror, and isekai are my usual jams. Shonen is in fact my least liked genre. But this was just... great. Amazing music, even more amazing animation, and just a great story with engaging characters. Not what I was expecting when my girlfriend asked me to watch a Dragon Ball movie with her, that's for sure. O_O.","10/10"
"HardLight","15 February 2023","I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will.","9/10"
"haris-sirah","25 April 2019","Avengers: Endgame is literally everything you have wanted AND MORE in a Marvel movie.
I'm not going to lie, it is slow to get into at the start, but the last hour is the reason I HAD TO give this film a 10/10.
Honestly, as everyone has mentioned, it's a culmination of everything good in Marvel. It's beauty, perfection and whatever else you can think of.
Endgame lived up to its hype and certain characters truly ended in such an amazing way.
You'll never expect ANYTHING.
No joke, I am going to have to go watch this again!!

"harish-8988","15 April 2022","I don't understand the positive reviews.All the progress that Broly story had made so far is lost in this movie.All the time goku and vegeta were fighting, frieza, cell, buu, beerus, tournament of power, etc. And Broly and father was stuck in a planet all this time?What happened to the old Broly, he was defeated by goku and vegeta, then resurrected again and again and now you are telling me that didn't happened.And I don't understand the power levels, Broly maybe a legendary super saiyan, but goku and vegeta are both super saiyan God and Broly can take them on in his normal form without even proper training and food?Just to remind you the scale, goku ssj3 defeated buu and buu was super strong. And now a super saiyan god, which is a step ahead of ssj3 can't defeat a saiyan?Not only ssj God, but Super Saiyan blue also can't defeat him.This doesn't make any sense.Instead someone could've used the dragonball to revive broly maintaining the original arc, and making broly more powerful than before.And what happened to Ssj3, it's not been used since buu. I think due to long hairs, the animators have to do some extra work, so the story now only includes transformations that change hair colors. It would be just easier to change the colors rather than change the hair length.DBZ was the best, super and it's stories doesn't feel like DBZ. Even when the characters are shown to surpass super saiyan levels and became a God they don't feel that powerful as it was shown in DBZ.I still remember when goku transformed into super saiyan for the first time. You can feel that he is much more stronger now.Now it's just they change hair color and that's it...It should be Dragonball Hair Colors rather than Super.","7/10"

"harry_tk_yung","2 December 2012","The story proper is book-ended between the scenes of a writer's (Rafe Spall) interview of the protagonist Pi, adult version (Irrfan Khan), which serve also as VO narration. Within this ""story proper"", the key segment that happens on a lifeboat drifting on the Pacific is further sandwiched between what happens before and after. ""Before"" show traces Pi's life early childhood (Gautam Belur) to teenager (Suraj Sharma) when financial difficulties forces his parents to close the zoo they were operating and embark on a family voyage to the U.S. together with the animals which they hope to sell upon arrival. ""Just like Columbus"", his father explained, to which Pi replied in a muffled voice ""But Columbus was looking for India"". ""After"" recounts the incidents after drifting in the Ocean for 227 days, hitting land for the first time (just an island) and eventually finding rescue at the coast of Mexico. Quite obviously, the ""key segment"" of drifting in the Pacific, which takes about an hour, is the highlight. But is must be said the 2-hour film is mesmerizing in its entirety.This centre masterpiece is to be enjoyed on two levels: visual and spiritual. There can never been enough said to do justice to the visual wonder Ang Lee has created, utilizing 3D in a way never used by anyone else before, to create beauty, especially when it comes to water. The spiritual context is so rich that the film arguably compels multiple viewing. Much has been elaborated by critics on the theme of divinity that transverse cultures. Similarly is the universal theme of valuing what you have, and reaching out to communicate your appreciation before it's too late. Most insightful is Pi's OV comment that the Bengal tiger, notwithstanding being a constant threat to his life, is in fact the most important reason for his survival of the 227 days. Here we are talking about loneliness. This fellow being has become Pi's reason for living, initially to stay away from its murderous claws, but later to caring for its every need from food to fresh water.A lesser director would have grabbed the many opportunities for sappy tear manipulation, which would be beneath Ang Lee. The scene showing the parting of Pi and Richard Parker the tiger alone will be reflected on for a long time.","8/10"
"harry_tk_yung","25 July 2017","""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was filmed as one continuous movie, then released in three consecutive years. But that was mainly because of the integrity of the source material. The rebooted ""Apes"" trilogy (""Rise"", ""Dawn"", ""War"") is exceedingly well conceived and planed. It is quite plausible that when the first one was filmed, they knew exactly what the third one will be like, at least in broad strokes even if not in minute details.Picking up from where ""Dawn"" left off, ""War"" starts with the unsurprising scenario that humans do not want to leave Caesar and the peace-seeking apes alone. Joined by war-seeking followers of Koba ( after his death) they track down Caesar, only to be defeated and captured. Caesar sends the human captives back, telling them to give their leader a message of goodwill. ""They will give the message?"" one of Caesar's compatriots asks. ""THEY are the message"". Such dialogue is unlikely to be found in mindless summer action ""blockbusters"".What follows is a very familiar scene of affectionate reunion of family and friends when Caesar and his troop return to the community. At this point, even if you have not had the familiarity with the physical appearance of apes from the previous two movies, you would likely have forgotten that you a watching apes. Brilliant motion-capture actors (particular Andy Serkis's iconic portrayal of Caesar) and CGI definitely contribute. But the familiar sentiment is the same whether it is the community of apes from minorities of the real world, say, aboriginal people with their privacy disturbed by explorers, slave brought back from a different continent, or victims of genocide by mad political leaders under the illusion that their race is supreme.The remainder of the movie can be broadly divided into two parts: Caesar (and a few companions) on the road, and Caesar in captivity.Caesar's quest is to look for his youngest son, as well as to face the ultimate villain The Colonel (perfectly cast Woody Harrelson). During the first part, which is not unlike a road movie, two more people are picked up, a human pre-teen girl Nova that does not have the facility of human speech and a physically unimpressive fugitive ape ""Bad ape"" that turns into a comic side-kick on this journey. The obvious irony here is that while the human cannot speak, the ape can. The reason soon becomes apparent. There is a new strain of virus that deprives human of the ability to speak, nature's punishment with Biblical flavour.The next part, when Caesar alone is captured, unfolds like an allegory of two other movies. Caesar as a leader of prisoners forced to do hard labour without adequate food will remind you of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). The ultimate escape, to a lesser extent, has traces of ""The Great Escape"" (1963). The highlight is the confrontation between The Colonel and Caesar. At their first close-up face-to-face, Colonel say ""I can't kill you. Look at your eyes, almost human"". Later, he keeps commenting that Caesar is ""too emotional, taking things too personal"". He has a reason of sorts for saying this: while he has killed Caesar's son, he also killed his own son to help prevent the above-mentioned virus, ""nature's punishment of our arrogance"".The ultimate, often hinted, twist is that the ""war"" is not with apes after all, but between two groups of militant humans, culminating in mutual annihilation. As Caesar looks upon the carnage, the audience may recall an indelible image from the original ""Planet of the apes"" (1968), when Charlton Heston, in absolute shock and despair, looks upon the ruins of the Statue of Liberty with the devastating realisation that this ""planet of the apes"" is what home will become in future.Now, fifty years later, they (audience) understand why, courtesy of a brilliantly constructed trilogy.","10/10"
"harrymartin-54768","16 October 2019","This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures.
In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film.

"hassannaima-55714","2 July 2023","This here movie isn't one of those movies when animation is the only good part. This here movie has amazing story, and connects really well to the first movie overall. It seems like all this was planned ahead, and it probably was.I really liked the movie and its characters. We now get a new villain who opposes Miles, with his motives being very clear. He also is a bit comedic in the first half, though he gets taken more seriously later on. It wouldn't be exciting to have an antagonist with no real threat.Gwen Stacy plays a more important role in this movie, which we clearly needed. I'm glad the movie showed a bit more of what she was going with post-Into the Spiderverse. Instead of having a 30 second clip summarising her story, we have a 30 minute beauty telling her storyWe're also introduced to other such as new character, Miguel (Spider-man 2099), Hobbie (Spider Punk), Mumbai's spider-man, and so on. I cannot dive deep into these characters because it would spoil a lot of the movie. Though, I enjoyed that all the different spider-man had their own animation style. This here is something we're going to see time and time again in the next movie.The animation doesn't seem like a can of spray paint painted across, it isn't too fast and you can see what is going on. All you do is sit there and admire the movie and its fantastic animation, it looks and feel like music going through not your ears, but your eyes. Now I get why this here movie was being delayed. The soundtrack is nearly as good, and helps really drive the intensity of much of the scenes. Just take a look, and listen to the soundtrack. I promise to you won't regret it.The only down part is the ending, it makes this movie feel like a too long intro to the next. Also because it hypes you up for the next movie, by having the scene near the ending be so good and exciting.I can't really complain because everything else was done so good.Overall: The Animation, The characters, the story, the Soundtrack, the movie is all executed beautifully. 10/10.","9/10"
"hawkins_saints_rock","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10","9/10"
"haydenluz","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","10/10"
"hdavis-29","2 December 2012","I've been reading the IMDb reviews after seeing the film last night (in 3-D). I share the awe and pleasure most viewers expressed. In fact I wonder: why the 9s? Why not 10s? Seriously, on exactly what level do you think this film fell short? The acting? The computer-generated animal effects? The script? I mean, really? Where did it fall short? I've been wracking my brain and see nothing but perfection here. There wasn't a minute I'd rewrite or reshoot. It's just a damn good movie and could stand as the gold standard in quite a few genres. I had a friend tell me he'd take off a point because there were too many flying fish. Maybe he's right. I hope that's the worst thing they could say about any film I wrote or directed or produced or shot or acted in. Too many flying fish. Go see it and be dazzled. If this doesn't earn full marks from you, I seriously pose the question: what would?","10/10"
"healingtoolbox","16 January 2024","The Beekeeper's theme and moral ambition is a thousand per-cent clearer than 2016's Suicide Squad. Many of the same themes here, all much more clear-cut. This gives Japan Stratham strong moral momentum which wasn't possible in Squad. Perhaps the best Jason movie since Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw?This is a movie where you can and you do cheer when the bad guys get their just desserts. The audience I saw it with cheered out loud at the end. Since the 1980s, screenwriters have mostly beat up on international drug cartel lords.The Beekeeper suggests a better target. Beat up on internet hackers who prey on the public, amoral Tech Bros and anyone higher, whose allegiances are not ""for the good of the hive,"" translation: for the highest good of the 99% of working families, not just for elite interests.Jeremy Irons provides a valuable counterpoint to Jason. Jeremy is the older voice of reason; yet also, of the olf elite status quo. Jeremy is not the main villain. He represents the older generation who enable younger villains because it pays well.I especially liked how the motivations driving five or six supporting characters were fleshed out; and, how their varied motivators came into conflict. This made all the characters more believable.I'm ready for Beekeeper #2.","9/10"
"healingtoolbox","6 June 2023","Probably the most on-point, on-time zeitgeist expression since, well, 2018's Spiderverse film.The high point of wonders here for me comes late in the 2nd act when Miles and his mom talk alone. The mom is the most successful animated character in this film. The film goes on for another 20 minutes of wonderful lyrical visuals. Then I lost track of the plot almost completely. How a multiverse is affected by tangled webs of various Spider-people didn't work as an emotional thru-line for me.ANIMATION JAZZ returns! Animation nerds will know many effects here hark back to animation experiments in the 1950s-1960s of John and Faith Hubley et al. Generally these old pretentious visual effects are put to much better story use here--if several times overdone to the point of sensory overload.DC comics fans will note the Green Lantern Corps clearly inspired the Spider-person Corps here. Be ready for several jolting new spider-personas. I liked their choices.This is another movie which would play longer in theaters if 20 minutes of bloat was cut out; in this case, from end of 2nd act.","10/10"
"hector-61488","26 November 2023","This.. movie had potential to live up to all any Indiana Jones fan wouldve expected actually. But just.. the effects like the car-chase and all are done so badly they are almost laughable, early 1960s sort of scenes, such such bad editing, bad camera angles on action shots... it really broke up and cheapened the movie up to a disturbing degree for me.I'm not expecting grade-A CGI shots... but cmon..Its almost like the first hour of the movie is good and then they ran out of patience.So thats one point lost.The second point lost is the sheer and utter bad acting from Phoebe, which when u start noticing how bad she is... (not to mention Teddy..) ..a voice starts screaming in my head 'why on earth was she cast for this!'. She has no charisma with just as much acting talent as any average human being... there is zero chemistry between the two main roles. Why did they not cast a better lead for her role is beyond me... what a waste of a budget there.I was so pleased to see the one true female side-kick, Marion, even if just for a few seconds.Which is a shame because the story was actually better than the previous attempt, and brings back a lot more lost ark vibes and easy viewing. The momentum is fine. The script is fine. All the worldly adventures fine. Classic villains. All fall in line with the original Indiana stuff.. couldve been an 8.Alas.","6/10"
"hectorvernet","31 May 2023","First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.","10/10"
"heisenberg12","14 February 2021","I was loving this movie up until the very end when Pi has to change his story, and then the movie tries to use that as its message. It had better messaging in it in the first 45 minutes regarding religion, God, and spirituality than it did by changing the narrative. The metaphors were ambiguous and sufficient without doing a twist like that.Outside of that, it was a really immersive and fun movie to watch so it's conflicting enough that I want to rate it higher but also feel like it may deserve lower because of the ending. Still, compared to what other kinds of movies you can rent to distract and entertain you for two hours these days, I thought it was a great find and experience for that with high quality storytelling up until the ending. It could have been a 10/10 with a better ending.7.5/10","10/10"
"helghast-1337","23 April 2023","Let's be honest. Comic book movies are turning into cookie cutter movies. Bad guys defeated by good guys. It's getting harder and harder for marvel to make good movies with unique dialogue and interesting plots. I liked the first two ant man movies but this one was a dud. One or two memorable moments and an hour and a half of nonsense. The daughter grows up to be an annoying teenager that looks confused most of the time, almost like Bella from Twilight.The multiverse just added a whole bunch of nonsensical things to the already watered down marvel franchise movies and this is just going to get worse. Unfortunately these movies basically print money so there's no reason for them to do anything unique anymore. Shame.","7/10"
"Hellmant","20 July 2017","'WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the 'PLANET OF THE APES' reboot film series. It once again stars Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of a tribe of genetically modified apes, this time leading his people in an all- out war against the humans for complete control of the planet. The film was directed by Matt Reeves (who also directed the last chapter) and it was written by Reeves and Mark Bomback (who also co-wrote 'DAWN OF THE PLANTE OF THE APES'). The film costars Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn, Amiah Miller, Karin Konoval, Ty Olsson, Judy Greer and Terry Notary. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also another big hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it too.The story picks up two years after the end of the last film, when Caesar (Serkis), and the other apes, have been at war with the humans for quite some time. Some apes, that used to follow Koba (Toby Kebbell), have joined the humans in trying to hunt down Caesar and his followers. When a crazy Colonel (Harrelson) executes Caesar's wife (Greer) and child, Caesar becomes obsessed with hunting the Colonel and his army down. A dark (and very violent) war persists.What most impressed me about the film is that it almost solely focuses on the ape characters (especially Caesar), unlike the first two movies (which had multiple central human characters in them too). Harrelson is great as the human villain, and it's funny to see a veteran vegan (of 30-years) playing the violent oppressor of animals in this movie too, but his on screen time is very limited. Serkis is the star of the movie, and the astonishing special effects, and they both magnificently deliver. Reeves' direction, and script, are also both superb. The film is an epic war movie, that definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen, and I think it's undeniable that this reboot series is far superior to the original franchise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Mg3uG2FLNSE","9/10"
"Hellmant","27 November 2012","'LIFE OF PI': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Director Ang Lee's adaptation of the popular 2001 book (of the same name) by Yann Martel about a boy who survives a shipwreck only to be trapped on a boat in the Pacific Ocean with a deadly Bengal tiger. The screenplay was written by David Magee (who also wrote the script adaptation for the 2004 film 'FINDING NEVERLAND') and stars Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan in the title role (at two different stages of his life). The film is presented in 3D and packed with visual effects (for the telling of what was said to be an 'unfilmable' book). I found the film to be visually stunning but slow in places. It does build to a satisfactory conclusion though, about spirituality and how we all view the world.The film tells the story of Pi Patel (played by Sharma at age 17 and Khan when he's an adult in his 50s), who was named 'Piscine Molitor' by his parents (after a swimming pool in France). He changed his name to Pi in secondary school after growing tired of constantly being mocked for his name by fellow classmates. He was raised Hindu but also takes up Catholicism and Islam at age 12. His family owns a zoo but decides to sell the animals and move to Canada due to political problems arising in India. A storm causes the ship to sink and Pi is the only one who makes it on to a lifeboat, except for four other animals (a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a orangutan and a Bengal tiger). The hyena quickly feeds on the other animals before being killed by the tiger. Pi must then find a way to live on the boat with the deadly tiger (without being eaten by it). He tells this story to a reporter (Rafe Spall) when he's married with children and in his 50's.Of course Pi's religious teachings come in to play while struggling to survive on the ocean. That's what the film is really about and it plays a part in a twist ending as well. What the film says about religion (in the end) might offend some viewers while enlightening others. I liked the overall message of the film. It's definitely a little slow at times due to the fact it primarily takes place on the ocean with one human castaway and a tiger. In that way the film is a little like Robert Zemeckis's 2000 film 'CAST AWAY' as well. Visually it's stunning and probably worth the price to see it in 3D (unless you just don't care for 3D). Not my favorite Ang Lee film but it's definitely a decent fantasy adventure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-fGGKVWPc","1/10"
"hello-181-893413","30 April 2018","Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...","1/10"
"Hermione_Mertcan","19 February 2023","7 is well-deserved but wanted to give 8 just because I think 6.6 is not enough.Very good movie. No spoilers, decent sci-fi setup and plot with very good acting from especially Jonathan Majors and Paul Rudd but it falls short due to some reasons.I can't quite put my finger on it but I suspect it is the classic Team X type of superhero movie thing. Ant-Man should have been the hero, even the Wasp was too much of an addition the last time but now, we have 5 main heroes, some with some deus ex machina types of powers. It made predicting the ending of the movie relatively easy.Kang was a great addition though. The movie might suffer from some details but the reason it deserves at least 7 is that the main villain was incredible.A quick problem came to my mind when writing this though. M. O. D. O. K. is an awful design with all his scenes and his character, simply awful.","1/10"
"Herufied","6 August 2019","I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.","10/10"
"hexx-52214","2 June 2023","I knew this movie was gonna be great. But i never thought it was gonna be this spectacular...!!!. Hands down the best movie ive ever watched in theatre. And maybe the best marvel movie too. Coming from a die hard DC fan ive enjoyed every single second of this movie. Visually its just marvellous. The animation style is unique. Even better than the first one. Story, tone, phasing , comedy and emotional weight is perfectly balanced. Last but not least the MUSIC. The music gave me literal chills all the way through. Ive never heard that much great music in any other comic based movie. Just perfect . Next thing is all the homage to old spidey movies, cartoons and comic books. Just well done. I hope one day ill be lucky enough to see a DC animated movie as good as this. Cant wait to see the next part.","10/10"
"heyrandom","1 June 2023","I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.","10/10"
"hh-94450","30 April 2019","If you are going to do a two-part movie, you need to flesh out the second movie before you make the first one. Infinity Wars - why did Dr Strange give away his stone? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if to take the Soul Stone requires a soul, what happens when you return it? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if there was only one hope for victory, what was it? Endgame - I don't know. Dr Strange refuses to tell and obviously a few Avengers had a chance of taking and using the hand, even in Infinity. So is Dr Strange BS or what? Endgame has the biggest fight scene of the Marvel series but for the most part it was an all-in brawl. Dr Strange's group and Ebony Maw seemed to have a plan but no-one else did. To look real battle scenes do need to be choreographed.
So it's the end of an era and presumably the start of a new one. Afro-Americans did well. They have Black Panther, Cheadle stays on as War Machine (takes over the Ironman position?? )and Falcon becomes Captain America. Women fill a host of secondary positions but only Black Widow has been at the core of the Avengers and Captain Marvel was distanced from the Avengers (ie. underutilised) in Endgame. Black Widow went without any sign of a replacement so yep, we now have an all-male Avenger Squad. WTH?
As a movie Endgame was good but as a sequel and a wind-up of the series, it was lame.","9/10"
"hifiman-62270","16 January 2024","Actually no idea why the story is being regarded as poor. It's relevant in today's age of rampant online fraud. And the fact that people who exist who shall we say have ""ghosts"" past is hardly the thing of imagination. So actually its quite a simple revenge flick based around reality..however of course it's a Statham flick so he has to be phenomenal and virtually unkillabe. But it's all done in a very well staged way. Exciting . Brutal. Simple and brief and efficient. I'd say it's a less styalised grittier John wick style movie and expect a sequel to be greenlit very very soon. Don't expect anything else and just enjoy be the ride.","2/10"
"highmarksreviews","29 April 2018","""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.","10/10"

"Hitchcoc","2 February 2024","This is a pretty tiresome film. One chase after another; one narrow escape after another. Harrison Ford is old; let's face it. What is done to him as that aged character is too much. This is one nasty scrape after another. The enemies are the Nazis--well one in particular, who would like to go back in time and kill Hitler (whom he thinks screwed up the war). To do this he needs to get his hands on a magical dial that has time travel capabilities. There is a device that was engaged by Archimedes (remember-the guy in the bathtub in science class). Others can go through the thousand and one things that happen in tis episode. There are so many unexplained thing, solutions without clear problems. It's just a disappointment and did not need to be made.","8/10"
"Hitchcoc","22 January 2013","This is the most wonderfully original movie I've seen in such a long time. It is set up with an amazing touch. We are absorbed into the Indian culture by some of the most lovely people. They are understanding of Pi's dilemmas and his religious confusion. They support him, although he is an arrogant little twit at times. There is an amazing scene where he shatters his boundaries and almost gets himself killed by the tiger who later becomes his shipmate. The special effects are probably some of the most believable and effective I have ever scene, from the shipwreck to the game of (excuse the expression) cat and mouse that ensues. We are totally involved in the incredible story of Pi and how he uses his knowledge and survival skills to maintain both his life and his sanity. The tiger, Richard Parker, is so well conceived and so believable in his own evolution that we grow to feel for him and his fate. There is a comradeship that one can only view. I found myself describing this movie to a friend, and when I finished he acted like I was crazy to have liked it. I guess Pi felt the same way. This is a movie that takes a wonderful book and an amazing story to new depths. There is also, of course, Pi's struggle with his views of a god that he can't quite define. His is an honest doubt. No character in fiction is asked for more and has to question the entity that he says as responsible for the loss of his family and his abject loneliness in the middle of the Pacific. I can't wait for this to come out on video so I can savor it again. My regret is that I didn't get to see it in 3D which I don't normally care for.","6/10"
"hobgoblinlol","8 August 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is a good film, better than the first one for sure but not something that should have 8.9 rating. I'm mixed about the animation, some things look really great but the other half is nauseating. I really didn't like the phasing, the movie is more than 2 hours long and it feels like the chase scene in the multiverse takes 1/3 of the film. The Spot is a fun villain but still don't get how he suddenly goes from wanting to rob an ATM machine to wanting to destroy the entire world, don't like how he just disappeared for the rest of the film. Miguel was fun even though his backstory was also really generic. Across the Spider-Verse is a good movie, but it relies on flashy animation and fanservice to cover up it's flaws. For example, am I the only one not ok with classic Peter Parker bringing his daughter to extremely dangerous places? Or with Spider-Woman getting slammed to a train while being pregnant? Also, too many Spider-Mans are just a parody of themselves. Don't get me started with awful modern humor. Overall, the sequel is better than the first film, but even more overrated. Flawed plot, great animation, ok soundtrack, fun action, too much fanservice.","10/10"
"hoernkeem","18 August 2023","Eric's Grade: A
'Across the Spider-Verse' is the animated sequel to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse' and is set to be followed by 'Beyond the Spider-Verse'. With Sony's ownership of the Spider-Man character this is their conduit for continuing to tell Spider-Man stories, and, while Peter Parker makes an appearance, this is once again a Miles Morales led story who is probably the most popular non Peter Parker Spidey from the comics. There are numerous recurring roles from the first film foremost among them being Shameik Moore as Miles, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales and Brian Tyree Henry as Jeff Morales. Notable supporting voice cast includes Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Issa Rae as Jess Drew and Jason Schwartzman as the Spot. 'Across the Spider-Verse' uses the same stylized animation and carries over the feel and tone from the first film flawlessly. That achievement is made more impressive by the fact none of the directors are the same from the first film and the only writer that remains the same is Phil Lord. This will certainly land on numerous end of the year lists and is easily a frontrunner for Best Animated Feature. 'Across the Spider-Verse' is a tremendous box office success as well taking in over $680 million at the box office on $100 million budget.We initially encounter Gwen Stacy from the previous film who, in the midst of a battle with an enemy that has spilled over from the multiverse, reveals to her father that she is Spider-Woman. When he shuns her she turns to the Spider-People who have showed up and they grant her acceptance/asylum in there multiverse Spider-society. Meanwhile Miles is doing his Spider-Man thing his way on Earth-1610. He laments the loss of love interest Gwen, has typical awkward teenage interaction with his parents and battles evil super villains with his own brand of Spidey humor mixed in. One such villain is The Spot and is easily foiled by Spider-Man although, little does Miles know, this villain shall return much more powerful, determined and ruthless than before. All of a sudden Gwen returns, but she is a tad stand offish and secretive. Miles discovers that she is part of a secret Spider-Society headed by Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man 2099. Miles follows Gwen into a portal to the Spider-Society's HQ where he discovers, to his shock, why he has been generally shunned by this society, and why all of a sudden the majority of the Spider-People turn against him. He flees seeking to write his own story and not have it written for him. He flees to save himself and his family. He flees into what he thinks is relative safety until a fairly massive plot twist leads into a cliffhanger ending that will leave fans drooling for the third installment of this series.Holy Spider-People Batman! If you thought the handful of odd Spidey's from 'Into the Spider-Verse' was jarring wait until you encounter a world(dimension?) full of them. There is so much going on in this movie that it is hard to quantify. The action and animation are stellar along with all of the voice cast. There is some genuine, heartfelt emotion that comes through as well with regard to Miles and his family, Gwen and her father and Miles and the Spider Society including Gwen. For the most part the writers do an excellent job of reigning in a very confusing, chaotic subject and keeping it focused and coherent. That said there are a few story elements that don't quite make sense to me. The crux of Miguel's fixed intensity at Miles is that Miles is an anomaly that was never meant to be Spider-Man due to the fact the spider that bit him was from another reality. If that is truly such a bad thing though I have no understanding why Miguel and his transdimensional Spidey task force allow Miles to go unmolested until he literally shows up at Spider HQ. Also if Gwen truly knew what was going on I have no understanding why she ever went back to visit Peter putting him, and the fabric of reality, in tremendous danger. Besides that..... pretty solid. I had a blast with this. I recently re-watched 'Into the Spider-Verse' and loved it more than I remembered. This is essentially more of the same just expanded to the point that it will melt your brain.... In a good way! The twist cliffhanger ending is a stroke of genius that ranks up there with some of the best cliffhanger endings ever in movies. For a two and half hour run time, which is the longest ever for an American animated film, the movie flies by. It would honestly be difficult to make this movie better, and I cannot wait for future Miles Morales content in this wondrous Spider-rific world.","9/10"
"Holt344","6 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final film in the franchise, also the first which is not directed by Steven Spielberg nor written by George Lucas. It's instead directed by James Mangold but if I remember correctly I read how Spielberg was there to help give his thoughts. Mangold co-wrote it with Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp. The latter of them wrote the screenplay for the previous film in the franchise. The film stars Harrison Ford, John Rhys-Davies, and Karen Allen reprising their roles as Indiana Jones, Sallah, and Marion Ravenwood, respectively, from earlier films. New cast members include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook and Ethann Isidore.Set in 1969, the film follows Indiana Jones and his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw trying to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can take it for himself and change the outcome of World War II.Fifteen years ago, I'm fairly certain my father took me to see Kingdom of the Crystal Skull after having shown me the other ones, which made me fall in love with the character of Indiana Jones and the adventures plus the mythology around the archeological finds. Steven Spielberg directed every installment and was close to direct this one before deciding not to, James Mangold was a great replacement and possibly the best person for the job which he shows in almost every scene, it's the writing that drags the film down though. I miss Steven Spielberg though, he's important for the franchise, as important as writer/producer George Lucas. What I think many including myself thought is how would this film turn out with a new creative team under Disney and Kathleen Kennedy, it ended up being a satisfying conclusion to Indiana Jones and a good adventure film. What each film had, including what was the worse one ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", was great action sequences and sadly this new film doesn't have many good nor memorable action sequences. There was one which was great and memorable, and it was the last action sequence, which will become iconic I'm sure.Regarding the writing, there actually was character development for Helena Shaw which I didn't think there would be, the dialogue was bad for her though. I liked the character development for Harrison Ford, though the characterization in the beginning was a bit off. It's thanks to the themes which made his arc so great. Overall though, the writing was actually quite okay! I really liked the story, the characters and especially the antagonist. Mads Mikkelsen along with Harrison Ford had the best performances, Helena Shaw's friend Teddy Kumar became extremely unnecessary in the second and third act, having so much plot armor and being perfect in everything left a sour taste for me. I liked the characters of Basil Shaw and Renaldo. One important character that's missing is Mutt, killing off Mutt/Henry Jones the third off screen is something I'll always ask myself, yes Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't the best Jones film but Mutt was not what was wrong with the film. I dislike how Disney or Kathleen Kennedy love to make these well known characters (first Han Solo and then Luke Skywalker and now Indiana Jones) into a grumpy person who had a failed personal life and gets divorced, it's something with the old iconic characters which she loves to destroy. Mutt was supposed to take the hat when he was older, now the story has changed. With all that criticism over the way, I also think they managed to do it in a good way, adding extra layers to the first and third acts of the movie through a blunt, emotional reveal. It also offers dramatic motivation, a trauma to dwell on. More than anything, it reflects the more serious nature of part five, whose eulogy for an unpopular addition to the family tree is all part of its attempt to give the legendary Indiana Jones a less-silly parting adventure. As a plot design, the Dial of Destiny was pretty good, mostly as it goes hand in hand with the theme of loss and what you could go back and change if you could. I actually liked the ending, it was a fitting ending to the character of Indiana Jones in his fifth and final movie. According to Mangold and Ford, Dial of Destiny is about age, time and family relationships. Mangold said the film ""is not about aging per se, but time - the way time travels for all of us, the way we all get older as the world changes around us."" I really liked James Mangold's direction and visual storytelling, I just wish the screenplay was better. This film suffers the same as the previous film in the franchise, an overabundance of digital effects and CGI, all of which combine to create a world that is as visually unappealing as it is unconvincing. The musical score by John Williams remains one of the highlights. Steven Spielberg was a executive producer on the film, serving as a mentor to James Mangold aswell .I agree with both of these critics, positive and negative. John Nugent of Empire Magazine gave the film four out of five stars, complimenting Ford's performance, and noted Mangold's camerawork ""moves confidently through action set-piece after action set-piece, keeping up a frantic pace."" David Rooney for The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film, writing ""it's a big, bombastic movie that goes through the motions but never finds much joy in the process, despite John Williams's hard-working score continuously pushing our nostalgia buttons and trying to convince us we're on a wild ride.""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is quite a good adventure film, but it lacks that extra heart which the previous films had. James Mangold tries and you see his love for it. The film left me satisfied and happy, yet also disappointed as the fifth and final installment could have been so much better. Say what you want about George Lucas, this was his character and story, and it's unfortunate we didn't get to see his story for the final film, like what Disney and Kathleen Kennedy did with his sequel trilogy plans. I think any fan of Indiana Jones should watch this, Harrison Ford is great in it and the return of Sallah will be appreciated by many. I think the audience are wrong in rating it so low, It's far from perfect, but it's just great in a lot of ways but also bad in some ways. There's no aliens in this film if you disliked them in climax of the previous film, instead it's time travel and Hollywood is all about time travel and multiverses right now. The villain is less cartoonish and it's why I think he works extremely well, Indiana Jones is also back fighting Nazis. I liked the film and writing this the day after, my opinion haven't changed which it can, seeing a spectacle like this at the cinema is an experience itself. It was an incredible experience! An adventure film for the family.","2/10"
"Horror_Flick_Fanatic","6 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones film series. The film stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, who races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history. Accompanied by his goddaughter, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA.The film has a number of problems, but the biggest one is the time travel narrative. It just doesn't fit with the Indiana Jones universe. The Indiana Jones films are all about historical adventure, and time travel is a very different genre. It feels like the filmmakers were trying to be too clever, and it ultimately undermines the film.Another problem with the film is that the Nazi narrative is getting old. We've seen Indiana Jones fight Nazis in three of the previous films, and it's starting to feel repetitive. It would have been more compelling if Indiana had done a completely new adventure in the 1960s, instead of repeating the same Nazi narrative of world conquest.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a disappointing film. It has some good action sequences, but the time travel narrative and the Nazi narrative hold it back. I would not recommend this film to fans of the Indiana Jones series.Here are some specific examples of how the time travel narrative and the Nazi narrative undermine the film:The time travel narrative breaks the rules of the Indiana Jones universe. In previous films, Indiana has always been a man of his time. He's used his knowledge of history to solve puzzles and defeat his enemies. But in this film, he's able to travel through time and change the course of history. This is a major departure from the established rules of the series, and it doesn't make sense.The Nazi narrative is getting old. We've seen Indiana Jones fight Nazis in three of the previous films. It's starting to feel like the filmmakers are running out of ideas. In this film, the Nazis are trying to use the Dial of Destiny to conquer the world. This is the same basic plot as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It's not very original.I would have liked to see Indiana Jones do a completely new adventure in the 1960s. This would have given the filmmakers a chance to do something different. They could have explored the Cold War, or they could have had Indiana face off against a new enemy. It would have been a fresh start for the series.Unfortunately, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a missed opportunity. It's a disappointing film that doesn't live up to the standards of the Indiana Jones series.","7/10"
"Horst_In_Translation","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","9/10"
"hoshouchian","5 June 2023","I don't even know where to start. I already had unhealthy high expectations for this movie, yet it still exceeded those expectations far beyond reach. It lives up to its title by plunging us right back into the chaotic madness of the multiverse by delving into Gwen's perspective, exploring her dynamics with her family and the hardships that come with juggling two different identities while not letting either one overlap or dominate. The Gwen-centered prologue spans for a whopping 15 minutes. It chronicled everything from dramatic character-affirming moments and extravagant artistic expression to mesmerisingly fluid action sequences and laugh-out-loud snippets of levity. It's basically a microcosm of what we are about to expect from the remaining runtime, giving us just a taste of the absolute carnage that is bound to unfold. And my god, did this movie deliver!This sequel stands tall alongside Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day as one of the worthiest successors of a pre-established masterpiece. But it's not only a masterpiece, it's a true work of art. It lies one step above masterpiece. It's a Renaissance painting come to life. You can just randomly pause at a scene and take a screenshot and it'll be a beautiful wallpaper. I thought Into The Spider-Verse was the pinnacle of superhero storytelling. Man, I was never this wrong. I'm telling you this blows Into The Spider-Verse out of the freaking water. It not only reaches new heights. It tears up the sky and shoots you beyond the stratosphere. I am shocked to the core at how revolutionary this movie is. I have never seen anything like it. The experience I had in the cinema is nothing short of spellbinding. This movie had me strapped on tight in my seat right from the get go, then had me in a suffocating stranglehold, refusing to loosen its grip, let alone let go, and throttled me towards a rollercoaster ride of emotions and feelings, I don't even know how to react.This is a mindblowing experience that left me speechless at times, laughing for the most part, and utterly petrified by its closing hour. My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire time, I never felt the 2-hour-and-20-minute runtime and it felt like I was right there beside the characters. My jaw was wide open the entire time, I could not believe what I was being exposed to. And I thought watching Infinity War and Endgame was the high point of my moviegoing experience. No, this is not only a cinematic experience I will never forget. This is something else entirely. This is something special. This is a cinematic miracle. The fact that they pulled this off with flying colours is insane. Everybody is firing on all cylinders. From the seamless blend of countless different animation styles, the striking colours, the stark contrasts, to the deliberate compositions, this is a visual feast unlike any other. This is a textbook testament to the creative potential of animation. There can be a scene with two people talking, and the background is filled with so much detail. Every single frame, shot and sequence is meticulously devised and painstakingly choreographed. It's lively, it's dynamic, it's moving.And amidst the dizzying array of visual cacophony lies a story that chronicles what it means to be Spider-Man. Again Miles (alongside his fellow Spider-companions) is flung head-first into wave after wave of emotional peril, exploring themes of adolescent isolation, complexities of growing up, and finding where he belongs in this vast expanse of multiversal entropy. He is put in situations that tests his resolve and integrity as a human being and as a universe-hopping superhero, clashing with different Spider-people when they present conflicting ideologies. And the way the creative team executed these moral dilemmas is nothing short of intelligent and mature by not giving us any easy or simple answers, but making us question along with the characters what the right decision is and what we would do if we are in their shoes.Not to mention, The Spot turned out to be one of most menacing villains ever to have graced the silver screen. He started out as a goofy ""villain of the week"", but then more layers get peeled off and we get to witness this 3-dimensional sculpture of a misunderstood and unfortunate guy sucked into the wrong end of a calamity. They actually made us care and understand where he's coming from, why he is the way he is, and why he's doing what he's doing. And the new Spider-people all have distinct personalities and some of them get to really shine under the spotlight. The core of the story doesn't ever get lost amidst the wild collection of cameos and Easter eggs. The team behind this franchise show that they have formed a tightly-knit kinship about what they are cooking up and what kind of a story they are trying to tell.Also, when the action settles down, the dust clears and the superheroes take off their costumes, the movie does not get less interesting. This is a grounded drama as much as it is a superhero spectacle. The dialogue in this movie is so sharp and witty, it cuts like a water jet. It takes what the first movie established and built upon that foundation by deepening the relationships of the characters and weaving more intricate elements into Miles' journey of self-discovery. And we get to just marvel at the complications and how it all plays out. Everything is laid bare. The characters are put front and center, flanked by breathtaking visual ingenuity, sharp sound design, powerful voice acting and Daniel Pemberton's sublime musical presentation.This sequel is more than a sequel. This is the best Spider-Man film ever made. This is the best superhero film ever made. This is the best animated film ever made. This is the best film of the year and possibly the best film to have come out in recent years. And it's not even close. It is a love letter to the Spider-Man canon, poking fun at familiar tropes but not forgetting to inject fresh oil to keep the engine purring. They went above and beyond for this. Every single aspect here screams perfection, from the calculated directing to the slick editing.There is not a single nanometre of a weak link. The web of life and destiny is woven with tour-de-force cinematic artistry. I am telling you that we are witnessing the birth of one of the greatest film trilogies ever made in cinematic history. I have no reason to doubt that Beyond The Spider-Verse is going to be as excellent as its era-defining predecessors. This is truly a flawless achievement that keeps you at the edge of your seat for the conclusion. See you next March!","9/10"
"hotjanuary","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","4/10"

"howard.schumann","9 December 2012","According to Yann Martel, author of the Booker Prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi, ""If your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you."" In the film version of Life of Pi, the fearful opponent is a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker (explained in the film) and its worthy adversary is a teenage boy (Suraj Sharma) trapped in a lifeboat in the middle of an unforgiving ocean. For Pi, fear is the ingredient that is both his enemy and the friend that keeps him alive and helps him to maintain his faith.Directed by Ang Lee and adapted for the screen by David Magee, the film is an adventure story in the mold of Robinson Crusoe, a testament of faith, and a philosophical Rubik's Cube that will keep you awake pondering its meaning. Whatever meaning you ultimately bring to it, the film is a sumptuous visual experience that combines a dazzling combination of state-of- the-art 3-D and CGI technology to breathtaking effect. The adventure is framed by the adult Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) relating his incredible story to a Canadian journalist (Rafe Spall), sent by a friend to listen to a story that ""would make him believe in God."" As a young boy Piscine Molitor Patel (Ayush Tandon), the son of a zoo keeper in Pondicherry, India, shortens his name to Pi to avoid being teased at school. Pi is a spiritual seeker who attracted to Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity and has even studied the Jewish Kabala. Pi's embracing of all non-conflicting religions is rejected by his parents whose philosophy is secular, and his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) challenges his son to make hard choices in life. ""Believing in everything,"" he says, ""is the same as believing in nothing,"" Santosh is a hard taskmaster who graphically demonstrates, after Pi attempt to feed the Bengal tiger in their zoo, that wild animals are not your friend and will kill you without a moment's hesitation.Unfortunately, hard times fall on the family and Santosh must sell the zoo and take the family and some of the animals to Winnipeg, Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship. When an unforeseen storm batters the vessel, all members of Pi's family and the ship's crew are lost at sea. Pi is the only survivor and clings to a lifeboat accompanied by a hyena, an orangutan, and the huge cat, Richard Parker, who climb aboard. The young Pi witnesses the survival of the fittest and soon finds himself alone in the middle of the ocean with a ferocious tiger. The terror of the shipwreck is made real in a visceral 3-D experience of the raging water, thundering in surround sound.The central portion of the film depicts the day-to-day effort of the boy to tame the tiger and provide enough food for both to survive their over 200-day ordeal. The magic of technology produces beauty as well as terror in scenes of the ocean at night with the boat wandering alone beneath the stars, a cadre of flying fish, luminescent jellyfish, and a leaping whale. Whether or not you believe that the boy is really in danger aboard a boat with a man-eating tiger does not detract from the sublime feeling of connection with nature that the scenes engender. To add a surreal aspect to the adventure, the two companions find themselves on a strange floating island overrun by a colony of African mongoose known as meerkats that allows Pi to gather more food for his return to the sea.While the film's coda puts a slight damper on what we have just seen, the questions it raises are central to the film's message. Contrary to the opening invitation to the writer to research Pi's story because it would ""make him believe in God,"" Martel says that, ""God is not IN the story, but that God IS the story,"" and challenges the viewer to choose which story to believe, the one we have experienced for almost two hours or the alternative story that Pi tells Japanese insurance investigators. According to the author, ""Stories are important, because everything is in how we perceive it and nothing is really real until we say it is, so why not choose the better story?"" In my view, what Martel is saying is not that we should choose the better story because it provides a palliative by keeping pesky reality away, but because it offers the context for a richer experience of life. Did the Hanukkah candles really burn for eight days without oil? Did the Buddha really live? Did Christ? We can never know for certain, but ultimately it may not matter if the impact of the stories can lead us to a true spiritual experience, one that is touched by love whether or not we believe it or have a Bengal tiger along for the ride.","8/10"
"hp-33729","6 August 2018","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","9/10"
"hscrowofficial","13 March 2019","Not only did they bring broly back, but they did him justice. And effing hell, those fight scenes and the movie as a whole was perfect. Best dbz movie in my book.","10/10"
"hucken","8 August 2023","I struggled giving it 10/10, but i can't think of a negative thing here.First of all the music is perfect. Especially the intro / Gwen Stacy part was perfect here. Her emotions amplified by the drums. Her vs. Peter and when she puts on the costume in her room going into the next fight and the whole fight theme. Everything was elevated by the music perfectly and hyped me up for the complete first part of the movie.And the art style ... it is just beautiful. It is brave to have such unique art style for a whole movie and it pays of. Every scene is a piece of art. If you have the video, you can pause like every frame and make a wallpaper out of it.The story was good too. When you thought it was predictable, it wasn't (e.g. Hey there is this machine that brings you back to your universe - that will absoluteley be used later - but didn't see the plot twist here)
Also some deep plote lines everywhere. The movie was long and i was never bored. Worst was the TBC. (but a plus for the movie itself, because you wanted to continue to watch)I wanted to make a minus point on the fast combat/swing scenes, but even there - it was fast, sometimes hard to follow but it still had a really nice flow to it that made it enjoyable. They were able to make every move of the Spider-whatever powerful and impactful.Half of the movie was a Spider Gwen movie and i wasn't even mad about it. The character is so good, that i hope they will make a Spider Gwen spin-off.","9/10"
"hydralien","2 February 2024","At this point, Statham could have just been bashing baddies non-stop till scores roll, and that'd be the best movie ever. No script, no dialogues, just bad guys facing their bloody demise. Well, maybe a few catchy tough guy phrases to top that.Sadly, this movie ain't it. There's some good fighting, and some catchy phrases too, and Statham is just as tough and amazing as ever. But also he's the only one who's doing any real acting, in between kicking bad guys. Even Jeremy Irons looks like he's just surviving through his role - not that the role is great, and the dialogs are meaningful (not by a long shot), but they could at least try. The sleazy douchebag of a bad guy was alright though, but that's that.Oh, and there will likely be part 2...","5/10"
"hypercube001","28 July 2019","Watching Avengers Endgame started as a nice story that soon became boring and predictable. The problem is that it's supposed to end an era, to be a big moment before the curtain fall, but instead tries to pave the way for Marvell phase 4. There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside. Then the woke trend rear its ugly head. Anyway, it's safe to say that I'll avoid Marvel in the future. The Endgame should stay the endgame. It's time to move on.","10/10"
"iamjacksmoviechannel","11 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes, the third film in what I would call a classic trilogy, probably the best all-around set of three we've gotten in the 21st Century, hands down. This is why we go to the movies. In 2011 no one was expecting much from another Planet of the Apes movie, especially after the Tim Burton debacle 10 years before it. But we came away from it not only entertained, but with a feeling that we just watched an iconic character being born. Caesar will be to apes what Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine and right now both are looking like Oscar contenders, finally. Both characters are also involved in a war of another's making, also against humans. Caesar has agreed that those in his tribe must go to higher ground for their own protection and he even stays behind to lead the military away from the rest of them. This is a Caesar we've seen go from innocent child to cruelly-treated animal to fair and peaceful leader to the regrettable warrior he's had to become because Koba, the ape he trusted, threw him back into this fight. He wanted nothing more than protection for his family and tribe. Anyone who thinks Andy Serkis isn't doing some of the best acting they've ever seen here has no idea what acting even is. The ape-body movements have almost become second nature now to the severe emotions of guilt and anger that Caesar is going through. Serkis is bringing all that out and no, if he does win something that doesn't mean that he has to bring all the visual effects people up with him. Did Daniel Day Lewis have to bring up the make-up people when he won for ""Lincoln""? No. Why is this any different? The motion- capture performer needs to be recognized, and there has been no better than Serkis. I also love that Caesar is also fighting this final battle here and his same brothers who helped him escape captivity in the first film voluntarily are right along with him for this. It has a ""Saving Private Ryan""/ ""Band of Brothers"" type vibe, and this is not the only time i'll be making reference to other war films throughout this review. But yeah these are a lovable and gentle group of 5 apes, so chill and laid back but willing to do anything for Caesar and that is really cool and really touching, particularly the relationship between Caesar and Maurice. Steve Zahn also joined the pack as a comic relief ape who sorta reminded me a bit of Dobby, but he's OK. And remember I told you I would be making more references to war movies? Well Woody Harrelson's villain is a brilliantly conceived psychopath who definitely compares to a classic character from film history, but I won't say who for fear of giving too much away. But I will say Harrelson is perfect for something like this and is the best villain this summer so far. A major amount of credit should be given to director Matt Reeves, and screenwriters Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver, least of which for making an ape riding on horseback so much cooler, and less stupid, with each passing movie. The fact that Reeves is going to be directing the next Batman movie is particularly interesting to me because the guy doesn't revel in violence in any way. His work on these Apes movies is of violence as a sad necessity. That's Caesar, and that's also more of a Batman people can get behind. Yes, battles bookend this film and there is also a pretty neat avalanche sequence towards the end but this is a summer blockbuster that doesn't feel the need to give us one over-the- top action sequence after the next and you know what, it proves that's OK. It has a somber tone but is never depressing. There's a great theme here linking consciousness and the darker parts of human nature, and the film runs the gamut of being heartbreaking, moving, suspenseful, and even inspiring. Yes, Caesar being tied to a cross in one scene is a bit on the nose as far as symbolism, but he's earned it. Lastly, Michael Giacchino's musical score just sends this finale of Caesar's saga off right. The whole series has just been outstanding. This is what happens when you devote efforts to the here and now rather than to some distant universe (looking at you The Mummy) and on making sure plot threads make sense and have purpose (looking at you Transformers). It's also what happens when your lead actor is fantastic, when the heart is in the right place, when the goal is the make something that stands the test of time and that will make people want to automatically want to go back to it and say that was one hell of a hero that series created. If you know me, you know I don't usually overstate things but this is a classic up there with Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Nolan's Batman trilogy. Add it to the last.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.","10/10"

"ianandsarah1","4 December 2023","As a fan I wanted to feel joy and awe while figuratively traveling alongside Indy going on one last epic adventure. What I got was a big step down from all of his previous journeys, including Crystal Skull. Not to mention, as another commenter pointed, that deconstructing legacy characters/franchises didn't belong here. I think we've reached a point where such approaches to franchises robs certain sequels' purpose to any major series, which is to tell a story and not make it feel like some analytical term paper adapted in the form of a screenplay (eg Matrix Resurrections is a major guilty example of this folly).Also, when I said I wanted to feel awe and joy, this movie lacked those major attributes in exchange for melancholy and moroseness. None of the supporting even tried hard to give the movie any sense of levity. There was a kid, but he was no Short Round. In fact, killing off Mutt was a really dumb mistake. While he didn't have a warm reception, it doesn't mean he couldn't be improved in the follow-up, and killing him off was one aspect that brought the movie down. Oh yeah, he reunited with Marion in the end. But I didn't have any warm feelings of a happy reunion. In my head: ""Hi Marion. By the way, your son's dead."" It just reeks of studio interference. ""People don't like Mutt so just kill him off. I don't know how you do it, but just do it."" ""But I wrote a really good arc for him in the movie, and the fans are going to love him now."" ""Just do it already."" ""Okay fine. Jeez!"" I mean, he was only mentioned in conversation and then forgotten. We don't see a picture or him anywhere. Bad writing, if you ask me.Furthermore, the whole thing with characters dying on-screen made it a bit too dark and pointless. Why couldn't they have done something with time travel where Indy managed to save his colleagues and son from certain death. A nice Checkhov's gun moment. He goes back in time, and then...that's it. Would've been great if a big chunk of the climax was devoted to Indy stopping the Nazi man from changing history in any other time period, but an underwhelming anticlimactic plane crash would do.You know what would've been the best way to end the series? Atlantis! The ultimate lost ancient city teeming with valuable treasures and whatever mythical MacGuffin they're journeying toward would've been more eventful than a time-traveling Dial that was lame. Heck! Since this is supposed to be Indy's last on-screen adventure, it would've been great to Marion, Mutt, Sallah, Short-Round, and maybe another new travel buddy or two coming along for the biggest adventure that Dial lacked, and wasted it on an idea that was not fitting Indy (ie Just because it worked on Logan, it doesn't work for Indy). I mean, other than the Holy Grail, you can't get bigger than Atlantis. And they squandered it.","8/10"
"ibarix","7 October 2023","The animations are fantastic. Something between 3D, comics and animated film. Other... Where to start? 2.5 hours of a festival of colors and chaos. The film seems to have been made by someone with serious ADHD while on LSD. There is rarely a pause between sentences to process what has been heard. Combined with the cluttered animations, I had the impression that I was watching the movie at 1.5x speed. It can be seen that the film is totally adapted to new generations. Parents are friends instead of being parents, they use slang, everything is colorful, fast and ""adapted"" to short attention spans. There is no tension, the dialogues just flow without much expressiveness or meaning. There is more drama than action. Once again, the animations and style are absolutely phenomenal. The level of dialogues, scripts and everything else is not at the level of animations. The movie had to be at least half an hour shorter with a better story, less woke crap and far more suspense. This gives the impression that it is a Coca Cola advertisement. Due to excessive animations and hasty speech, the film is difficult to follow for long periods of time. A good idea, but the execution (except for the animations) is average at best.","6/10"
"ibibrov","1 May 2020","War for the Planet of the Apes was the best of the trilogy, and a truly beautiful and unique experience to sit through, my eyes glued to the screen taking in the jaw dropping visual effects, enabling Andy Serkis to deliver one of the most iconic performances I've ever seen, along with everyone else.

I loved this movie, and it easily deserves 9/10 stars.","4/10"
"Ido_Fong_Wong","21 January 2019","Let me start by saying that yes the animation was phenomenal and the movie looked very polished, but it wasn't perfect. The use of CGI at some part the beauty they had established, although it seemed used for useless details so it wasn't too bad.As far as I'm concerned everything else goes down from there.. The story was a rehash of the original Broly movie so that point is moot they could've done anything since that's what Super seems to stand for. The story held almost completely and with very few plot holes. However I cannot tell if it was cannon with the rest of the Super series.The characters seems only like total parodies of themselves outside of the fights, but far less intelligently handled than previous iterations of the story. They seemed dumb as rocks and far too accepting for their own good.Now the music I don't know if it that was part of the localisation but it was simply horrible. Adding the name of the characters in it does not make it music, and that is only pointing out one element. Either the series have lost their touch since Super or as always localisation plays a big role.The voice acting or most likely the mixing was also very lackluster. Some of the dialogs were being buried in louder well inserted music/sound effects and they were likely important, but I can't tell because I couldn't hear them so much it was soft spoken. If I had to point out the worst one it would be Frieza.All in all, it is a very entertaining movie, but I wouldn't have needed to see this on a big screen, or at all.","5/10"
"ifroonaryok","18 February 2023","It was okay. I expected too much after the stunning experience from Loki. But don't get me wrong, Jonathan Major did a fantastic job as Kang, love him. Kang is a worthy new big badie for the Multiverse Saga and Jonathan Majors is amazing. But the plot just doesn't seem that great. It could've been improved upon. And while it's not short at 1 hour and 50, I wish it was longer because I want to see more of Kang. Also, weird they recast Cassie Lang but I think I like Kathryn Newton as Cassie.But this isn't my final review. I may have a change of opinions after a re-watch once it comes out on Disney+.","7/10"

They are taken as slaves by the humans, to build a wall (Egyptians forcing Israelites to build cities). They are whipped and tortured by the humans, until a plague (surprise surprise) kills their leader (the human army Colonel).An army of humans come to the place where the apes are and are killed by an avalanche that destroys the human army (much like the Red Sea drowning the Egyptians). Then Caeser the ape leads the freed ape slaves (Israelites) across the desert...to the promised (a new) land. Before joining them, Caeser dies, as Moses died before setting foot in the promised land.All in all, it's the story of Moses, the Israelites and the Egyptians, but with apes replacing the Israelites.Lazy writing!","10/10"

""Is Gogeta stronger than Beerus?"" And being honest i dont think that Broly is stronger than Jiren. If Goku went 20x kaioken SSB i think Goku would be able to do something against him where else when he fought jiren in that form it didnt do anything. Gogeta is on par with Jiren i think but still a little below Beerus. But MUI Goku is stronger than all of them.","7/10"
"imdb-23821","14 January 2024","I love Jason Statham. I'll watch his nonsense like Crank, The Transporter (all three), and it's painfully fun to watch his best like Lock Stock and Snatch. But this dumb vehicle he walks through as does the rest of the cast, without even trying. Even the script seems to mock the audience and I'd say a poor man's John Wick 1 but that's a slap in the face to the poor version.Does this sound familiar? Wealthy magnate has son who is a brat and runs his own lower grade scams. One happens to hit close to Statham, just a quiet beekeeper. Without an effort, J calls up his posse to find out who it is and nobody knows. J decides to walk through the front door, wreak havoc, and let the FBI fumble at who this man of ultimate devastation can be for half the film. That's after he practically broadcast himself.Move forward and it only gets sillier and lazier. J must take down the entire organization. You could throw the army, navy, air force and marines at J but he'll walk in without a gun and let his super fast hands of steel (ala camera slight of hand) do the talking. Then he'll go John Wick style through all of them, even without a weapon, through dozens of them. Imagine a superhero film.There is really no point. Something about a beekeper, a hive, a queen bee, none of it really needing to make sense, just to sound diabolical. The problem is this isn't a parody nor meant to be one. It was just lazy junk. The ending might be the funniest of all, being only interested in a sequel. Don't say you weren't warned.","5/10"

"imseeg","12 January 2024","I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful.","4/10"
"imseeg","3 July 2023","What do the haters complain about? And why you should still watch this final edition.1 The first Indiana Jones editions were the best.This new edition has got the same spirit, the same amount of action, the same amount of adventure and I loved it (almost) as much as the early editions.2 The leading actress Phoebe is a disaster.My personal opinion is that she aint bad at all. She shines. And dont forget she doesnt have to carry this movie, Harrison Ford does.3 Harrison Ford has gotten old and grumpy.Correct. He has been always grumpy! And yes, he has gotten old and director James Mangold shows Indiana's old age in all of it's demise AND glory. Respect!4 There are no jokes. It's too serious with too many killings.Rubbish. There are still enough good jokes, but not the ""in your face"" jokes we were used to. But I love the more subtle, indirect jokes.It is more serious though and I LIKE IT. Even an adventure needs some serious notes, to be more credible. And by the way, I am not a kid anymore and so arent many other Indiana fans!5 Steven Spielberg didnt direct it.But James Mangold did and whoever googles Mangold's Imdb carreer, soon will find out this director has made some fabulous movies. I applaud his direction!I loved this edition. It had everything I needed in an adventure packed movie. It thrilled me. It made me laugh. And the final scenes really TOUCHED me and gave me goosebumps. I had a wonderful time watching this last edition!Just another solidly made Indiana Jones flick. Enjoy the show!Thank you for reading my 2000 th review on Imdb.","7/10"
"imtiazgafoor","6 December 2023","The much-anticipated latest installment in the Indiana Jones franchise left me with mixed feelings, leaning towards disappointment. As a long-time fan of the adventurous archaeologist, portrayed by the venerable Harrison Ford, I couldn't help but sense a certain staleness in the narrative and execution of the film. The playful charisma of the action is mismanaged, the discoveries of ah-ha moments are redirected to the lackluster costar, and scraps for Indy.The film attempts to recapture the magic of its predecessors, blending action, archaeology, and a hint of the supernatural. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as the iconic Indiana Jones, brings his signature charisma to the screen. His portrayal is still compelling, capturing the essence of the character that has become synonymous with daring adventures and narrow escapes.However, despite Ford's commendable performance, the plot feels like a hodgepodge of recycled elements from previous films.The introduction of new characters is an attempt to inject freshness into the story, but it falls short of making a significant impact. These characters lack the depth and complexity that made the original supporting cast memorable. The chemistry between Indy and his new companions feels forced, unbelievable, their motivations are thinly developed, making it challenging to invest emotionally in the new characters. Basically, over emphasized and exaggerated people we'd expect to be cast aside by any true to the character intelligent indy.One of the glaring issues with the film is its pacing. The action sequences, which were once a highlight of the franchise, now border on cliché. The film seems to rely too heavily on nostalgia, recreating iconic moments from earlier movies without adding any meaningful twists or enhancements. The result is a sense of déjà vu that diminishes the excitement and leaves the audience craving something truly innovative.Furthermore, the film struggles to find a balance between paying homage to the original trilogy and forging a new path. The nods to past adventures often come across as forced and disrupt the flow of the narrative. It feels as though the filmmakers were more focused on recreating the magic of the past than creating a compelling story for the present.Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While the cinematography captures the exotic locales and intense action sequences, the use of CGI at times feels jarring and out of place. The practical effects that were a hallmark of the earlier films are overshadowed by modern technology, robbing the movie of the tangible and gritty feel that defined the Indiana Jones aesthetic.In terms of the storyline, the mystical artifact at the center of the plot lacks the intrigue and mystique of previous MacGuffins. The quest for this object feels more like a checklist of Indiana Jones tropes than a genuine exploration into the unknown. The lack of a compelling antagonist further weakens the narrative, as the stakes never feel as high as they did in the earlier films.In conclusion, while it's always a challenge to meet the expectations set by classic franchises, the latest Indiana Jones installment falls short of the mark. Despite Harrison Ford's valiant effort to bring his iconic character to life once again, the film suffers from a lackluster plot, underdeveloped characters, and an overreliance on past successes. Die-hard fans may find moments of nostalgia, but overall, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the original trilogy timeless.","1/10"
"inactivekick-76609","22 February 2023","Marvel has given us tribute stories for some of their other fabled characters, so it seems only apt they sent the Ant-Man out with a pretty decent closure tale.Sending the main entourage of characters back to the Quantum Realm sets the ideal stage: as it also (finally) gives Ant-Man fans a far deeper look and exploration of the Quantum Realm, and much about its history, peoples (human or not), and secrets it may be harbouring for certain characters.On that basis alone, i think the director and story-line creators did an admirable job of finally cluing us up on the mysterious realm we had previously heard so much about but had nary a clue about. So mission accomplished, and done so rather nicely.Without the hitherto spoilers, it's notable to mention that the ""Super Boss Villain"" of this particular excursion into Quantum Land, kind of steals the show, as he excels as easily the best character portrayal in this entire movie. That said, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and other Earthlings do make fairly good plot fillers.All together this is everything we've come to expect from Marvel, and is nice end to the Ant-Man trilogy.A fun and exciting watch, for sure ;)","7/10"
"indiana1981","24 December 2023","Just watched this movie a few months after it came out. I saw the reviews were mixed, which is why I put it off, but honestly, I don't know why people were disappointed...As an Indie fan, I have high expectations and this movie does please in all areas. Firstly, I am happy this movie retains the darker vibe we feel in ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" - (I know some people didn't like this?). I also like the Nazi theme. And given Indie's age, he does not overly exert himself, his character is realistic for his age.I think Phoebe Waller Bridge is a nice addition to the franchise too. (I would have liked to have actually seen more dry British humour, but maybe this was toned down for an international audience).I was worried the story around the artefact they were chasing, would at some point unravel into a mess, (like the last movie), but it didn't. And I have to say the ending made me smile, it was cute and I loved seeing Indie end his stint embracing with Marion.I guess ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" holds so much nostalgia for me, but I enjoyed the small sprinkles I saw in the movie.The only thing noticeable, is that Steven Spielberg didn't produce this movie. But all in all, I'm happy Harrison's final movie was produced at a good standard, it's entertaining, has a good storyline and keeps you interested.Definitely worth watching.","6/10"
"infinitetyler","30 April 2023","This is just bad, and I went in with low expectations. Production quality similar to CW or a Disney afternoon kids special. The special effects are atrocious, and now I understand why Victoria was fired. The veteran actors try to add their charm sometimes, occasionally, when they feel like it. Cassie is insufferable and I was kind of hoping she'd get eaten by ants, and maybe most of the rest of the cast. The script is just awful. The story is absurd. I was actually kind of shocked by how each scene kept managing to be worse than the one before it. A heavily CGI-reliant movie with horrible CGI, and pretty bad everything else that cost a lot of money to make. If this were a cable tv series I'd give it a 2-5, but they had everything they needed to make a great movie, but decided not to.","7/10"
"inforaza","22 July 2017","If you've not seen War of the Planet of Apes, here's a Warning: THERE IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! What exist are just skirmishes between humans and the imprisoned apes who were trying to escape.In fact, it is a FLOP movie! Only 15 people were watching the show.The first 75% of the movie is very, very slow and the movie is 30 minutes too long (actual length is 2hr 20 mins). This is because the story-writer hopelessly failed to think of ways to add Thrill and a real War – but, instead, made the plot move at a snails' pace just to elongate the movie time.In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes. Not a second more.The movie ends in an ""unconvincing"" manner: One military faction is eliminated by another military group. And this group is eliminated by a roaring Avalanche. This helps the apes to escape to the dessert they were planning to relocate on.NOTE: The Avalanche was created because the story-writer could not think of a way for the apes to attack and defeat the military faction. How Convenient! LOL! The only great thing about this movie is the CGI which makes the apes look 100% realistic. The Avalanche too looks realistic. The visuals and cinematography is great.WPA is an extremely ""unconvincing"" end to a trilogy whose first 2 episodes are just Moving & Thrilling – which touched your heart and mind. They made you feel for each of the characters.I feel like giving TIGHT SLAPS across the faces of Writers Matt Reeves and Mark Bomback, just as I felt like giving the same to Roland Emmerich for Independence Day 2.","5/10"
"inkblot11","17 April 2013","Pi (Suraj Sharma as a teen, Irrpan Khan as an adult), has quite a story to tell a Canadian writer (Rafe Spall) when he comes calling. As it were, Pi was named after the longer word for swimming pool, Piscine, in French but an obvious, objective nickname became the norm until he demanded to be called Pi. His father and mother ran a small zoo in their Indian city and loved swimming pools, too. Pi got in dreadful trouble one day when he attempted to feed a Bengal tiger through skimpy bars. His father and mother made him watch the animal, named Richard Parker, long story, kill and eat a goat, as a lesson. Pi understood quickly the power of this beast. Later, due to financial difficulties, the family decided to move to Canada, where they would sell the remaining animals, including RP. Alas, on the boat, where the cook (Gerard Depardieu) belittled their vegetarian needs, a storm arose. A Japanese vessel, everyone sunk except Pi, Richard P, a zebra, a hyena and a monkey. These five managed to make a lifeboat, but because of the laws of nature, soon the only ones left were Pi and the tiger. For awhile, Pi hooked up a few life rings, by rope, to the small boat, whenever Richard Parker didn't get enough to eat and was on the prowl. Miraculously, this went on for weeks but when would they be rescued? Would they be? Bravo, dear Ang Lee, for making a film out of a complex novel, albeit a great one. There is much talk of religion and other philosophical matters in the book, as the story unfolds, and a great deal of this is captured. The first part, where the family life in India appears, is lovely, with great scenery and acting. Once on the waters, too, the imagery is likewise fantastic, as the story turns to the fight for survival. There are also flashbacks to the present, where the older, married Pi tries to elaborate any peculiar details. The acting is also wonderful, with no familiar stars except Monsieur D, in a rather small role, but no matter. All are compelling. The varied direction is enchanting, with its use of cutting techniques to keep the viewers involved in the action. Alas, I chose not to see this in 3-D at the theater, what a mistake of the decade! But, even on a small screen with no bells and whistles, this is an enthralling piece of cinema.","8/10"

"inovski","11 June 2023","We waited 5 years for a sequel and let me tell you, it was worth it.This movie had me glued to my seat for the entirety of it's runtime. I loved everything about this movie hence why I rated it a 10.Animation: The animation was breathtaking, it never seized to amaze me. It is so obvious from the get go that the people behind this movie put in so much time and effort to create what's probably the best spiderman adaptation that exists. Without the talent and dedication from the animators, this movie wouldn't even be half as good.The plot: Superb all in all, everything tied together very well and I enjoyed how we had 2 storylines at the same time that get tied together, which makes the whole story that much better and immersive. I'm sad that we have to wait another 3-5 years for the next one but at least we know it will be perfect.The characters: They perfectly captured spiderman's charm and humor. The small differences they showed in each spiderman was really fun to see as well.All in all this movie took what the first one did well and made it basically perfect. This is the first time I've come out of the theater without any cons to list. If you haven't watched the movie yet, DO IT NOW!","10/10"
"IonicBreezeMachine","15 January 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a solitary man who keeps bees on a parcel of land rented to him by retired schoolteacher Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise is scammed out of her personal finances as well as those of a charity she manages by phishing scam operation lead by Garnett (David Witts), Clay and Eloise' daughter FBI Agent Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman) soon find out that Eloise committed suicide with the perpetrators most likely going to evade prosecution. Taking matters into his own hands, Clay dives into his combat skills he learned as part of a clandestine organization known as Beekeepers intent on bringing down the criminals who drove Eloise to her death which takes him through the highest echelons of power.The Beekeeper is an action thriller directed by David Ayer and starring Jason Statham. In a month that's seen no shortage of assassin/secret agent based action thrillers (The Bricklayer, Role Play, The Painter, etc.) if you're going to watch one of these movies, then The Beekeeper is definitely the one to choose.The Beekeeper is about as simple a premise as you can ask for with Statham's Clay your archetypical strong silent protagonist who motivated by some loss embarks on a path of revenge. Even in his 50s Statham hasn't lost step when it comes to delivering the goods and the script plays itself with a bit more humor than you'd expect which allows Statham to tap into that snarky side that plays to his advantage. The movie delivers some solid antagonists in Josh Hutcherson and David Witts whose cocky arrogance bringing to mind the worst aspects of tech/NFT bro tropes make them easy to hate and Jeremy Irons is quite fun as the head of security who acknowledges their deaths are basically foregone conclusions after angering a Beekeeper and only continues to organize protection details for them out of obligation rather than believing anything can be done. With the quirky clandestined world established in the movie regarding the Beekeepers, the film has more than a few shades of John Wick or other films in its DNA and for the most part if this is the beginning of a franchise I'm interested to see where they take it. The one downside is a sideplot involving Emmy Raver-Lampman's character Verona and her partner Wiley played by Bobby Naderi. While I understand having a character who follows someone like clay through a story like this, Verona is very poorly written as she seems like she's more upset about Clay's rampage than her mother's death and every time the movie pulls back from Clay to focus on these characters it only serves to stop the flow and reiterate information we already know.The Beekeeper is a solid ""B"" film that delivers the goods thanks to Ayer's tight direction and the always welcome presence of Statham. The Beekeeper like its titular hero is quick, clean, and efficient and you'll get your money's worth.","7/10"
"IonicBreezeMachine","18 May 2023","After helping defeated Thanos and saved the universe, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has become a celebrity with a best selling book and made up for lost time with his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton). During dinner at the home of love interest Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and her parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and the recently returned Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), Cassie showcases a device that can map the Quantum Realm where Janet was lost by sending signals which Janet is none too happy about for reasons she doesn't share. The device opens up a worm hole sucking in Scott, Cassie, Hope, Hank, and Janet sending them to the Quantum Realm with Scott and Cassie in one area and Hope, Hank, and Janet in another, where they soon find themselves caught between a resistance between the denizens of the Quantum Realm and the tyrannical despot Kang the Conqueror (Johnathan Majors) who has a connection to Janet.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third film in the Ant-Man series and the first film in the fifth phase of the MCU. The third Ant-Man movie was intended from its inception to be larger scale with director Peyton Reed stating his intention was ""a massive world-building undertaking"" citing the aesthetics of Heavy Metal magazines as an influence. You can't fault Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania for its ambition, but in execution it has many of the flaws of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness without some of the redeeming points that compensated for that film's messy screenplay.I will say once again Paul Rudd is good as Ant-Man with his likable down to earth charm making him an endearing presence in this universe. I also liked Kathryn Newton as Scott's daughter Cassie with the two having a nice natural chemistry and still building on the father/daughter dynamic that has been a strong emotional core of this franchise. The movie is also a bright and colorful film with lots of details and some inspired setpieces such as a scene involving multiple possible versions of Scott Lang or hyperintelligent ants but unfortunately the story and the nuts and bolts are where we begin to see the weaknesses. Quantumania is much more serious minded entry for Ant-Man in the same way that Thor: Ragnarok was a tonal departure from the prior Thor movies, but where it worked there by refreshing the character, here the tonal shift feels like it takes out a major part of the Ant-Man movie's appeal. The movie also has way too much stuffed into it as it's more focused on setting up Kang the Conqueror than exploring the Quantum Realm and while the Quantum Realm looks visually interesting, there's not much world building and the denizens of the realm they introduce just sort of get overtaken by the visual noise that makes this feel less like an Ant-Man movie and more like a Star Wars clone. We also have Corey Stoll returning as Darren Cross who is now M. O. D. O. K. And it's honestly a lateral move as he was underwhelming as a character in the first film and he's not much more interesting here.Quantumania isn't the worst MCU movie, but it's definitely one of the lower ranking entries in that it's so stuffed without much development on its own story and more focused on setting up plot points for other films. It's perfectly serviceable even if not particularly exceptional.","6/10"
"IppeiK","20 January 2020","The revival of the Dragon Ball franchise with the ""Super"" series has been somewhat of a phenomenon, and it has continued with this movie (the first one I've seen which wasn't also a season of the TV series).I was initially confused as to why they were doing another Broly film, because he has appeared and been defeated at least 3 times before. This film, however, does an incredible job of building the backstory and thus adding a bit of emotion to the film. To this end, they use the characters and their personalities well to create something that is just more than powering up and battles (there is that, but it's not just that).Only obvious downside is the fact that non-Dragon Ball fans probably won't be able to enjoy this as much but, if you were going to watch one Dragon Ball movie. This would be the one to watch.","10/10"

And since when is Wanda this strong? It's a bit disappointing that the infinity stone wielder Vision himself seems to be that weak.When Thor was about to beat the crap out of Thanos, holy moly. That was one epic move.I can see that I'm not even sure what to write since there is not so much plot but rather the movie is just filled with action. It was definitely a blast.","10/10"
"ironhorse_iv","16 July 2017","It's time to wage war! Ape-Calypse Now Style! This is the story of 2017's 'War for the Planet of the Apes', which pits, Caesar (Motion Capture & Voiced by Andy Serkis) & his ape colony, against an army of human, led by a ruthless, Colonel McCullough (Woody Harrelson) following the events of 2014's 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, despite the film's title being about the all-out war between apes and humans, the majority of the film is centered on intense, dramatic moments between Caesar and McCullough in a prison settling. While, some people might find, that boring, because of the lack of action, I have to disagree; as those scenes did led to a lot of conflict, between the belief of total authoritarian, and swore allegiance to Colonel as a mean to control the means of the production & the populace versus the belief of working rights & unitization of the four species of ape, under consul leadership under Caesar. Not only does, these open defiance moments, help the film, but it also remind me of prison films like 1963's 'The Great Escape', 2001's 'The Last Castle', 1967's 'Cool Hand Luke' and 1994's 'Shawshank Redemption'. It also seem to me, that the film took influence from much darker prison drama films like 1993's 'Schindler's List' & 1997's 'Amistad', with its harsh allegory of race relations. While, some people might get offended by the anthropomorphism & the sinister portrayal of humanity. For the most part, people understood the story, it was going for, and let it, in. Even if, most of the movie is downright gritty gloom and doom, war & cruelty. It's clearly not for all children, with it intense sequences of violence and death. Lots of frighten imagery. Despite that, the action scenes in the film, were just as good as the prison, rebellion scene. The opening credit, alone is worth, the ticket price. This is, by far, one of my favorite movies, in the reboot, 'Planet of the Apes' series, because of the action. However, there is a few nitpicking flaws with it. One is the fact that the 3D was rarely used. So check it out, in 2D. No need to spent more money, when you don't have to. Another is the many of plot-holes, like why didn't the Colonel, just outright kill Caesar, when he first enter the prison yards? You would really think, that would end, the rebellion, before it even started, since the prisoners didn't know that he was there. Plus, it's not like, it didn't stop him, from trying to do it, before. Unless, his brain skills are so devolution by the Simian Flu that he forgot, the reasons, why he was going to kill Caesar, than I find, this act, very jarring, for somebody that favors stopping any sign of the infected with a dime of a hat. Also, it also seem to me, that his prison isn't well guarded, seeing how the Northern Army will be, heading their way, any minute. After all, a little girl was able to sneak in, and give food & water to the apes, in a long scene of time. It just doesn't add up. Despite that, Woody Harrelson was great in the sinister role. He really did look, like he could do, another action movie, at his age. Yet, there was another problem with the story besides the Colonel's odd judgments; which was, the unneeded comedy from Bad Ape (Motion Capture & Voiced by Steve Zahn). He was borderline, 'Jar Jar Binks' of annoying. It just doesn't mixed well, with the serious tone of the rest of the movie. Anyways, despite that, I do like the references and Easter eggs to the original series, throughout the film. That was fun to see. Also, I love, the story is very similar to the fifth and final entry of the original series, 1973's 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes', in tone, but is different enough, not to be a direct remake, as it does not fit into that series' continuity that well. Hopefully, the whole Icarus subplot would make sense, once it's introduce, in a future series of films. However, there is a part of me, that doesn't want any more films to continue this storyline. As I find, this reboot trilogy of movies, to be amazing on its own right, from start to finish. I really like, how the three movies establish, Caesar in 2011's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', developed him in ""Dawn', and had the perfect closure for that character, in this film. These three films really does cement him as a seminal figure in the fictional ape history. It would really be, hard to watch, another film, in the series, without the character, in it, or the actor that plays him, Andy Serkis, whom probably the best CGI model motion capture actor of all time. It would be a letdown. Despite, what happens, in future films, at least, I can say, this movie end the three film, very perfectly in a grand finale. The CGI work for the apes was amazing. The cinematography by Michael Seresin was breath-taking with the beaches and snowy mountains. They really do look like, they really are, there. I also have to give credit to the music by composer Michael Giacchino. It was excellent and touching. 'Nova's theme' alone will make you, cry, when hearing it. Without spoiling the end of this, Matt Reeves's film, too much. The last shot of the movie, will leave you in silence. It's that powerful. Overall: This movie is a great popcorn movie that needs to seem. So, stop monkeying around! Go see it! It's worth your time.","10/10"
"ironhorse_iv","27 July 2013","Written by Yann Martel, Life of Pi was one of those novels that most filmmakers thought was un-filmable. The reasons why are because 'Life of Pi' deals with the main character grew up trying to find the ultimate truth of life by questioning different religions and aspires to find that ultimate truth one day. Life of Pi is about seeing the world through Pi's eyes. This is precisely why it's strongly called an un-filmable book because it's almost impossible to visualize on screen the combined feeling of every sight of the amazing spectacles that the ocean can show an young adult like Pi and how they take him closer to the answers for his questions. But, Directed Ang Lee succeeded in making this movie amazing. This movie visuals are amazing. Epic cinematography by Claudio Miranda. Ang Lee was able to make the near lifeless seem boring Pacific Ocean into a wondering trip into self-discovery and survivable. The 3D actually work, and wasn't cheesy at all. I love the soundtrack by Mychael Danna, it was beautiful to listen with the film. Life of Pi just had such a rich story. On the outside, it's basic. A castaway, kind of film. But Ang brings brilliant timing to the film which makes it emotional and strong. It's confusing at times and sometimes feels slow, but you forget about that because the movie is something that has good meaning, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Life of Pi is very faithful to the book, I'd suggest reading first, but anyways most of the film is about a young man name Piscine 'Pi' Patel who father own a zoo. Suraj Sharma plays Pi in his film debut and what a debut, he was great in the film. The scene where he kill the fish was emotional. Anyways, Pi and his family decide to travel to Canada for a better life, and hopefully make money selling the zoo animals. Too bad, nobody makes it beside Pi who survives a disaster at sea when his ship sank leaving him in a lifeboat with four animals on board. There is a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger name Richard Parker. Unlike, other human & animal relationship movies, that has the character befriend a wild animal to the point, it seem like it's a pet. This movie doesn't do that; at all. Most of the movie has Richard Parker wanting to eat the Indian boy. It wasn't until Pi establish himself as the alpha male that Richard Parker became less of a danger to him. I have to say the CGI tiger was the most realistic computer animal, I have ever saw. Good job! Still, Pi and Richard Parker must now learn to survive this harsh new world. For a PG film, it pretty dark with themes of cannibalism. Research Richard Parker and shipwrecks online. Some critics says it has warning about the dangers of increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and ocean acidification, but I really don't see that in this film. I do like the Gaia hypothesis that some critics point out. I can see it. Without spoiling too much of the film, I have to say that the movie is really good. Still, it took a while for the film to get to the sinking scene with all the attempts at spirituality. While, I did love the scenes explaining who Pi is like the whole French swimming pool story, and Pi looking for religion and love. I just wish it didn't take so long to explain because I think the best part of the movie are the relationship with him and the tiger. I do love the idea that most of the narration coming from middle age Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) telling his story to the novelist Yann Martel (Rafe Spall). Irrfan Khan gives one of his best acting here. I love the scene, where he explains what happen to Richard Parker. I was deeply surprised he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for this role. I do hate the fact that Yann Martel plagiarism the idea from Brazilian writer and physician Moacyr Scliar 1981's novel 'Max and the Cats'. Still, I think Life of Pi is a little bit better than 'Max and the Cats'. I have readt both in doing my research for the film. I just glad the director cut the state of delirium scene from the book. The twist in the end was so moving and truthful. It marked how humans are in fact like animals and also gave an alternative to the basic perception of life; do you chose to view life through science and reason, or religion. The movie is deeply religionists, but it didn't bug me like other critics. I love the symbolism of the island of algae. It represents the atheist mindset that we eat till death and we get consumed by the world itself in the end and nothing matters, a bleek future. I myself, as an agnostic, I understand the brute cruelty meaningless of this world. Raw matter organized itself with an organic backbone and over the course of billions of years of improvement, it emerged to artificially build a society upon all that nothingness. I agree, it's best to remain agnostic because you have no concrete answers about the universe. Atheism is a form of concluding one's mind, not a fan. Overall: The thing I like about this movie is that whichever story you believe, your right and both a physically possible whether you believe the literal or metaphorical meaning it is both equally plausible.","10/10"
"IronManu77","30 April 2019","Nothing is perfect, this movie is not perfect and yes it could have been better but it is a fitting conclusion to the Avengers saga and sad that we will not be some characters again in their super hero forms. There will be tears in the theaters so get ready. As for analyzing this movie, I recommend getting a PhD if you have to go into minute details. This is a movie and it will have plotholes, so enjoy it for what it is and the effort put into it.I watched this in IMAX yesterday and watching it again in Dolby in a few days with my family. Thank you to all the hard work put into this movie. Thank you Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, and many more.....my son was born in 2008 and you guys have served as an inspiration for us all. Thank you.","9/10"
"ironmonkeypimp","25 July 2017","This film was 2 hours 20 minutes. The middle 2 hours and 10 minutes were very boring. The interesting things (for me) was having Cornelious and Nova as those two, in grown up version are in the Charlton Heston movies. I also liked the music which can be described as ape drums. However overall this is just a boring film.","3/10"
"isaacsundaralingam","19 January 2024","David Ayer's 'The Beekeeper' might be good enough to make a convincingly fun trailer, but this Statham led action flick ends up being nothing more than a poorly written John Wick wannabe.Here we have Jason Statham playing Jason Statham as a beekeeper - an actual beekeeper but also a retired special agent part of an underground government program called (you guessed it) The Beekeepers. When his elderly neighbor, whom Statham repeatedly reminds us to be ""the only person who ever took care of (him)"", kills herself after losing her life savings in a phishing scam, he seeks revenge on her behalf, killing his way up the ladder of scammers towards whoever was responsible.'The Beekeeper' is written to be a very John Wick-esque action movie, with similar tropes and motivations, but with none of the smarts and the compelling that made the Wick movies so great. We have some bland characters spewing a bunch of off-the-script exposition at every opportunity, an underground system that's entirely uninteresting, some annoyingly corny bee trivia and worst of all, not a single satisfactory revenge moment. It's a revenge movie but the whole movie is just a repeated ""Wait, is that it?""... EVERY SINGLE REVENGE SCENE... ""Wait, is that it?""The action scenes were passable, sure, and the movie is definitely not boring, but at the end of the day, it's not worth your time. You might be inclined to say that it's just a mindless action movie and that I'm being a bit too harsh, and sure, maybe, but should I really not expect even the tiniest amount of logic and creativity in a movie that I'm supposed to be entertained by?","5/10"

"Isak777","13 July 2023","I saw it in a theater, and I was hoping to enjoy it.The things I didn't like is that they animated Harrison Ford's face to look younger in the beginning of the movie when he was fighting nazis, but that's not that bad because they had, because Harrison Ford is too old. I didn't like that Steven Spielberg didn't direct the film because he refused to, but the director James Mangold is also a great director of such films as Logan or Ford V Ferrari. I also didn't like the time travel thing. At first when they are going back in time to go to World War II, they end up way before World War II and they meet the mathematician Archimedes, but it was fun to watch.I liked the action so much with the music by John Williams. Harrison Ford of course. Mads Mikkelsen as a villain Nazi was just a brilliant acting and he is such a great actor.Anyways the movie is better than I thought it was going to be and the movie sadly bombed box office, but I think it's a great experience in a theater.","8/10"
"isakhelgi","10 July 2017","In recent memory, There aren't to many movies that have gone all out.This apes movie does exactly that.. ...(this will NOT feature spoilers)What starts as seemingly a gritty war movie, you can feel the realism of it. How each breath taken has meaning and each step carefully taken.When the apes hit the screen, you are immediately struck, How far Technology has gone just a few years since RISE..This movie is epic and dramatic, A story told of the journey of Ceasar leading his people through war and his own personal conflicts, How each choice taken has consequences.The movie steers away from a full blown physical war as the title might suggest and is a lot more personal and controlled story. Through emotions and decisions the real battles worth watching are. The real war is really within ceasar the whole time.Saying more would take out the experience, trust when i say that i highly recommend the movie and if you are sick of lackluster movies, And you are ready to really kick it back and enjoy.. Apes together strong....","9/10"
"IsThatJoseph21","4 June 2023","For the past two years, No Way Home was my favorite Spider-Man movie. Now, that title belongs to Across the Spider-Verse. Besides being a great Spider-Man movie, I'd consider this a great movie in general. I just saw Across the Spider-Verse, but I already feel comfortable placing this movie in the same category of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Dark Knight, which surpass every aspect of their predecessors.I love Into the Spider-Verse as much as everyone else, but I believe Across the Spider-Verse improves everything from the first movie. The one part of Into the Spider-Verse that always held it back from a 10/10 to me is the villains. Kingpin and the Prowler are serviceable, but I always thought they were uninteresting. With Across the Spider-Verse, the villain is a major improvement. Miguel O'Hara had a compelling motivation, while also being a genuinely threatening antagonist.I already thought Into the Spider-Verse's animation was breathtaking, but Across the Spider-Verse somehow surpasses it. The entire movie looks like a work of art, but the highlight for me would be every scene in Gwen's universe. The backgrounds and colors in those scenes are gorgeous. Just like the first movie, the fights here are fast-paced and fun. There are plenty of memorable action scenes here, but I particularly loved the first fight between Miles Morales and the Spot.This is sort of out of topic, but I also think Across the Spider-Verse was a better multiverse movie than Multiverse of Madness. Not only was the concept of other dimensions better utilized in Across the Spider-Verse, they were also more visually distinct here. Maybe it's because of the fact that this movie is animated, but each dimension in Across the Spider-Verse was able to have their own style and color to them, unlike the ones featured in Multiverse of Madness.Overall, Across the Spider-Verse is yet another masterpiece in the Spider-Verse series. It's both my favorite Spider-Man movie and my favorite movie of 2023. I know this year isn't over yet, but it's going to be tough to top this movie. I give Across the Spider-Verse a 10/10.","10/10"
"italo505","26 November 2012","Lately I've been going to be movies with the uncertainty of finding a good movie, a movie that is not a complete bore, one that doesn't lack of a decent script or one without way too many special effects that overshadows the performance or the story itself. Rarely do I come out of the movie theatre with a smile on my face after having the good fortune of picking the perfect movie. Thus is the case with Life of Pi.Many times we see miracles in our every move, in every day and we choose not to see them, we're blinded by a blindfold that we put on ourselves and we question everything that we hear, everything we see. We need an open mind to the wonderful miracle of just being alive and that's what I got from watching Life of Pi. God closes a door but He always opens up a window. Or throws you a lifeboat that happens to have a Bengal tiger inside.","4/10"
"itamarscomix","3 March 2013","The little I knew about Life of Pi before seeing it - a young Indian man is stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger - couldn't in any way prepare me for what I was about to see. The truly amazing thing is that that's pretty much all there is to it. Ang Lee weaves an incredible amount of emotion and depth into a very minimalistic, poetic story, and for that reason Life of Pi may be the most impressive cinematic achievement of the year - it's true cinema, a film that doesn't rely on a complex plot, shocking twists or tons of characters, but simply on coherent, free-flowing storytelling, beautiful images and utter precision. There's not a wasted minute or an unnecessary shot - the special effects are impressive but always subtle enough to leave center stage for the story. The film is incredibly easy to get into, it's constantly interesting, it's simple yet deep, and it leaves a lasting impression and plenty of room for debate - really, what more can you want from a film? Ang Lee is proving time after time that while he hasn't become a brand name like Spielberg and Tarantino, he's one of the most fascinating directors working today, mainly because he doesn't make the same film twice; Life of Pi is a perfect example to use when demonstrating how important a director is, and how much a good director can do with a very lean and (on the surface) plain script. Lee always had an eye for beautiful imagery, though, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography in Life of Pi makes for some of the most beautiful yet; not only the bulk of the film that takes place in the middle of the ocean and is dominated by CGI, but also the live action segments, especially the first thirty minutes. The opening sequence in particular is one of the most gorgeous I've seen in years, and while watching it in 3D makes the immersion a bit quicker, it's by no means essential and it's impossible to not get lost in the film, no matter how you watch it.A quick word on religion: I've heard about some people who avoid Life of Pi because, as atheists, they reject the religious undertones. I'm a devout atheist myself, and enjoyed it immensely, and I encourage other atheists to watch it too. The film has a spiritual undertone, yes, but it doesn't force salvation down the viewer's throat like some other films. In fact, I don't recall seeing another film that made me feel so sympathetic towards believers; it portrays religion in an ambivalent, affectionate yet critical way, and it leaves quite a lot up to the viewer's interpretation. It also makes a point of showing that, while religion has its purposes and can be of great help to people in tough situations, the division and hate between believers in different brands of religion is the thing that messes everything up, which is a message that I, as an atheist, related to. All religion, Life of Pi says, is pretty much the same - it's a way of coloring reality, of making it easier to handle and seeing the beautiful side of it. Like stories, and like films. Life of Pi is an ode to storytellers, be they Pi, the originators of religion or Ang Lee itself, and it's one of the most beautiful pieces of storytelling you'll see.","8/10"

"ItsRobinTV","15 February 2023","I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not.","7/10"

"ivan-samuelson","4 December 2018","Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.","8/10"
"ivanmessimilos","14 November 2021","It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.","10/10"
"ivanmessimilos","29 May 2021","A great ending to one of the best trilogies of the last twenty years. The film is visually beautiful and the CGI effects are amazing. This is especially seen in scenes with monkeys, and that's every scene in the movie. The vast majority of the dialogue is not done through standard conversation but vocal language, which may seem a little awkward, but the film didn't suffer at all because of it. Monkeys have numerous layers just like humans. The emphasis is on them, not on people, which is even logical given the story. The film contains a great combination of drama and action. I also liked what it has to do with the cult Planet of the Apes (which is one of my favorite movies) so we can freely call this a prequel trilogy. Great job director Reeves, I can't wait for his next project. I rarely see such a good connection through all three films. The downside is the title, which is technically inaccurate and could change some people's expectations. In fact, the last sequel is more of a War than this one. In some ways, the film surprised me because I didn't think it would go in that direction. Great proposal for a marathon: watch first this prequel trilogy and then Planet of the Apes from 1968 with Charlton Heston.","7/10"
"ivanpetricevic-88877","28 April 2019","No spoilers here. Story is unexpected and very original. If you thought you knew what will happen - well, you were wrong.
First half is a bit slow, but still interesting, with all the small pieces coming together.
Second part is full time action, almost as good as Infinity Wars, but a bit weaker in details. I do miss more of Dr. Strange more, but, on the other hand, Captain America was much better than expected. Humor was good, as always.Overall, this is a great movie and a decent ending to the saga. I think everyone will be satisfied.","10/10"

"Iykman","12 May 2018","This was crap to be honest. 
It had some good action but made no logical sense! A good movie must make good sense. First, Hulk is so toned down that Thanos didn't even employ any of the stones to beat him! In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! ""We have a Hulk"" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful.Waste of 2+ hrs for me.","9/10"
"izi_izu","24 December 2018","Going to cut short here. What can summarized here was that this movie is LIT!

Better stick to hand drawn animation. Nevertheless, its a solid 10 from me","10/10"
"J_Charles","3 April 2014","LOTS OF SPOILERS BELOW: in the DVD extras Ang Lee is quoted as challenging the CGI Tech team to create moving works of art. And boy did they ever deliver.In a film like this where the ocean dominates the scenery and in itself becomes a ""character"" and antagonist it is important to have it rendered well and here it is brilliant. So vibrant and realistic.That's just part of the fun. The tiger is amazing. It's hard to believe it's mostly CGI. And the acting by the young Pi is also incredible, especially when watching the extras and seeing him; eyes fully bugged out in terror at the tiger, while staring at a green screen.The story line seems bare but when you think about the raw emotions being delivered on screen it really hits home. the maturation of the young boy into a survivalist young man is quite an epic adventure.The ending - well I'll leave that alone. It' quite the twist and really makes you think hard about what's true, what's a representation of the truth. When he asks at the end ""which do you like better"" I started re-thinking about what it was I had just watched. And I think that's the mark of a great film.9/10","9/10"
"j-madej","4 July 2023","We living an an age of outrage...
From different type of social fractions battling it out online and in mainstream media, to internet trolls, which can destroy a movie reception, without actually knowing if the film is good or bad.I suppose everything is matter of taste, but when I heard early reviews of 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' was suggesting that it's pretty bat movie, I took that a little personal.Some of my dearest filmmaking experiences was watching Indiana Jones first 3 installments.I still feel 'Raiders of the lost Ark' might be one of the best adventure movies ever made.And when you hear that the last installment is poorly made and that the legacy of Harrison Ford as Indy is being tarnished, deep sadness and frustration can transpire.However I must say I am actually pleasantly surprised by this 5th film.Yes, It does feel a little too long being 142 minutes long and the ending might feel too much of a stretch, there still is enough quality to feel like legacy of I Indiana Jones has been wrapped up conclusively.The biggest problem I've got with this film it is use of the CGI.The original ' Riders of the lost Ark' was captured all in camera. All the stunts were performed by real stunt performers and there was sense of reality, which took our breath away as we watched action sequences. In modern times CGi makes things look fake and specially the first 20 minutes of the movie, although has that Indy advanture vibe, it gets uneven due to poor visual FX.Specially the de-aging as Harrison moves his head can't maintain the actual realistic look. Moments like that takes you out of the movie. You can try to de age the face but the body posture is of a 78 year old, so it simply doesn't work.But as film progresses it actually gets entertaining thanks to Phoebe Waller-Bridge,, which plays Helena, sort of female version of young Indie.The antagonist Mads Mikkelsen as former Nazi stylized on Wernher von Braun (former Nazi first director of NASA) becomes formidable opponent for our duo. On the way we get introduced to Marilyn boy played by Ethann Isidore l, which is clearly stylized on Short Round, a character from the second movie ,which becomes integral part of the narration. Some old characters from original movies come back although only episodically.'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is far from being perfect movie ,but it also not as bad as the early reviews make you want to believe.There 'a still a lot to like here. As it is usually with American-cinema of late, it's formulaic as you can clearly recognize elements of moments stolen from previous Indiana Jones movies, but in its totality it's definitely better then part 4, which was pretty bad.So, don't listen to internet trolls and check out this final installment of Indian Jones.It is not perfect, but entertaining enough, specially for the fans of this great adventure saga.","7/10"
"j-mayo1999","3 July 2023","While I cannot say that I truly hated this film, I cannot say that I loved it either. The first 15-25 minutes, give or take, are enjoyable. It was exciting and it felt like an Indiana Jones movie. However, the movie begins to crumble from there. I felt like I was checking my watch every 15 minutes or so. There were moments where I was bored and I honestly didn't care for some of the characters like Helena. Her character was there only to help create a story that was lacking in truly wrapping up Indiana Jones' story. The action was great, Indiana Jones was great, but that is all I really enjoyed from this film.","7/10"
"J49afc","3 May 2019","Is the film underwhelming? Yes. It is still good? Yes. With all of the hype i saw on social media and my friend's conversations I had extremely great high hopes for this film however I was left slightly dissatisfied.At 3 hours, the film is way too long and it can drag sometimes, especially in the tedious build up of the first half of the film.Whilst the second half of the film is quicker paced and more enjoyable, including a very well choreographed, action packed end fight scene, I had felt i has seen it all before when thinking about the fight scene in Wakanda in Infinity War and so this wasn't anything special to me. The only thing I did really enjoy about this scene was the return of the fallen soldiers through Dr. Strange's portals. For me, this was one of the best sequences of the entire film.Similarly, the payoff for the culmination of the fight scene- the Avengers defeating Thanos- was anticlimactic. The writers of the film were not going
to have the Avengers lose their final outing and so I fully expected this to happen. Contrast this with last year's infinity war, where I was left utterly shocked at the fact the Avengers, who had been built up as an unstoppable force over the previous 2 films, had lost. My jaw was at the floor in the cinema at the time. It was this complete unexpectedness of the climax of Infinity War that makes me believe, however unpopular this may be, that Infinity War was better than Endgame.This film is still however good. The cast are, as always, great in their roles and the production value is fantastic, which makes for some beautiful looking scenes. All of the jokes (bar Korg playing Fortnite and Hulk dabbing) land, as does equally the action sequences. The addition of new characters in the Avengers series, such as Captain Marvel, are a welcomed addition and inject some fresh blood into the already solid cast, even with their minute amount of screen time (seriously, Captain Marvel had more haircuts than minutes on screen).The plot is solid, although the time travel aspect is confusing at times. Similarly, the plot does open some gaping plot holes. Why are the Guardians of the Galaxy searching for Gamora when they ran into her in the fight scene? (I will admit I'm not a hardcore Marvel fan and so maybe missing something) and how can Captain America suddenly pick up Thor's hammer? (I definitely AM missing something there). Thirdly, there are continuity errors. Thanos tears Iron Man, Captain America and Thor and their respective weaponry apart all at the same time WITHOUT the gauntlet. Thanos is strong, but not that strong.The ending however was the perfect culmination of 22 films over the last 11 years. It tied everything together nicely and gave almost every character a satisfying ending, especially Captain America. Even the end credits with each actors signature were damn beautiful. It didn't bring me to tears but it did make me feel emotional.The Avengers films have been some of my favourite films over the last few years and so to see it end is saddening. This film could have been much better but I am not disappointed with the way the ended it. It really is the end of an era.","8/10"
"jaacy-84600","24 April 2019","I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.

"jaalmagu","24 February 2023","I don't know where to begin. This was worse than wakanda forever and Love and Thunder which were quite bad. The story is horrific. Plot holes everywhere, and way overuse of the same tropes over and over throughout the movie. Whoever is in charge kf the current marvel jokes needs to to be fired. Maybe just put Michael Pina back in since he was the funniest part of ant man. This movie even made Paul Rudd look bad which is very difficult to do!Trying not to spoil anything specific, but if you really want to see this, wait until Disney plus, unless you have amc or regal movie pass then I guess you could justify it if you want to waste time or hate yourself or if you like to ""hate watch"" movies. Or watch it ironically as a joke.","2/10"
"jace_the_film_guy","20 February 2023","The opening of this film is fantastic. I found myself laughing seconds after the MARVEL title rolled. Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang never feels like an act, as he naturally fits the role. His character is charming as ever in his 5th movie as Ant-Man.Marvel is known for extensive world-building and interconnected stories. Since 2021's ""Loki"", it has been known that Kang the Conqueror is the next Thanos-level villain in the MCU. This film gives us a deeper look at Kang, and the casting for his character (Jonathan Majors) is excellent.By leaving the regular world and diving into the world beneath (the Quantum Realm), the film relies heavily on green screens and computer-generated imagery (CGI). These graphics and effects are some of the poorest of the franchise, with a character called MODOK being the worst. There were times that the film was reminiscent of 2005's ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"".Other than the CGI, the biggest weakness in this film is the screenplay. From rushed plot points to painful dialogue, it is evident that the screenwriter had never written something of this magnitude. In the emotional and climactic moments, the script is so bad that it distracts from the story, with the audience in my theater audibly laughing.""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a small piece in the larger Marvel storyline. This is felt throughout the film, as the convoluted Quantum Realm and endless timelines are explored. The first two Ant-Man movies succeeded in simplicity, but this sequel was anything but simple. In short, the character of Scott Lang is better as the friendly, neighborhood Ant-Man.Best Character: Kang
Best Scene: Scott's Book Reading
Best Quote: ""I don't have to win. We both just have to lose!"" - Scott
Best Piece of Score: ""Theme from 'Quantumania'"" - Gives serious Avengers Campus vibes.","6/10"
"jace_the_film_guy","9 July 2021","Honestly, I was expecting more from the final chapter in the trilogy. A lot of the ""soft"" moments felt forced and I was expecting something different when the title includes ""War"". There were moments that dragged for me, but the story itself made sense. Caesar's end was anticlimactic and I left wishing for some more closure. I might have to do a rewatch without the prior expectations I had for the film.","10/10"
"jacekfx","31 January 2024","This could had been a good movie.They clearly had good budget. Maybe some explosions looked fake, but cars, costumes, etc were fine. They had good actors. I like Statham and Jeremy Irons. Event the general concept for the story is bearable. Everyone knows that it is not Godfather, but just some action movie.But they mixed the good stuff, with some completely nonsensical characters and events. The worst are final scenes, what ruins the movie even more. I don't wont to spoil, so I won't say nothing more.Also there is a lot of unnatural exposition. Characters explain a lot to each other. Even in situations where they clearly both should know it. Writer clearly was not able to ""show"" information. Everything must be explained in chat-gpt style dialogues.","10/10"
"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","2 June 2023","It was fun to watch in the cinema. But this is for sure. Not as good as the first movie. In some scenes I was so bored, I even fell asleep. I don't think the effects are as good as the first movie. But still not bad of course. I had fun. Spidermen were great. It was so good to see different spidermen. The action wasn't bad either. The ""meme scene"" was so funny. But there was something that wasn't there. Also, the fact that they ended the movie halfway like a series lowered my respect for the movie. It was like a filler movie then. It could be better. Unfortunately, I don't know how the original voiceovers are not yet, since I watched it with dubbing. But I'm sure it's very good. Once again, I'll probably watch it in English. Anyway, I think it was a good animated movie, but not as good as the first movie.","8/10"

I think the de-aged effect was very good. At some points I thought the effects weren't very good. The plot of the movie was good. Mads Mikkelsen also did a great performance. Phoebe Waller-Bridge was annoying in my opinion. I don't know, her acting is like that or the character is like that. I watched her for the first time. Frankly, I did not notice any difference in the soundtrack of the movie. But it was still ok. It didn't do well at the box office. I don't know why, I definitely think it would be an enjoyable movie to watch in the cinema. Anyway. Overall it was an average movie.","6/10"

I mean, she isn't a horrible actress or anything, but I felt it could've just been a little bit stronger and more developed. Oh well. Besides that, Life of Pi is just a flawless film, save for the romance. The runners up would probably be Moonrise kingdom, The dark knight rises, Argo, and The avengers. those films are just as equally great but whenever someone points a gun at my head and asks me what the best film of 2012 is, I would have to say Life of Pi. final score: 10/10","10/10"
"JackCowart34","21 August 2023","One-sentence summary: Scott, Hope, Hank, Janet, and Cassie are pulled into the quantum realm, where they must contend with the all-powerful Kang the Conqueror.I wouldn't consider Quantumania a full-fledged return-to-form for Marvel, but it did act nicely as a vehicle for Jonathan Majors to flaunt his pristine acting skills. He gets plentiful screen time, especially from the midpoint on, and proceeds to steal every scene while single-handedly raising the stature of the film. Some other positives include a fast-moving pace, a solid amount of quirky comedy, and a smidge of self-awareness, though some of Disney's recent fallbacks still lingered, like the cheesy dialogue and shallow relationship drama. There is an obvious sloppiness to the movie, but there are also just enough pros to warrant checking out the newest Ant-Man.","2/10"

"JackRJosie","16 July 2023","I want to be a part of the crowd that says they're done with superhero movies. There's a little superiority complex there. Although I believe superhero flicks are destroying the film industry, they are so dang fun. Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is unlike any superhero movie you will probably ever see. It's surely not your run of the mill. Perhaps films like this bring serious innovation to the big screen rather then destruction! I believe it so, as this film is unlike anything I've ever seen before.The animation is unreal, so creative and mind blowing that human being are even capable of creating this kind of 2D art! It's a seriously impressive film artistically speaking, and the brilliance doesn't end there.After watching the first spider verse film you would think they wrapped up a good thing, but they carry on this Miles Morales story in a really good way.

And that goes for both live action and animated films. From the moment it started to end I was hooked. The story was funny, dramatic, and enjoyable in a way that made me feel like the characters and story was actually real. And not just some mundane made up sci-fi story that's already been told a thousand times.

"jacobs-greenwood","19 July 2017","The original Planet of the Apes (1968) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) were the first sci-fi films that I can remember watching, having been born in 1960, and I preferred the former to the latter. I went on to see the sequel(s) for each, which is probably the reason that the Planet of the Apes remains a fond memory of my past; I even sought and watched every episode of its short-lived TV series. I saw Tim Burton's reboot and have seen the newest trilogy that culminated in this one.So it is with this backdrop that I can say that this is the best of the other films, save the original; the original has to be the best because it gave us the initial concept. This latest trilogy is faithful to that vision and is so multi-faceted, giving us much of what was lost in the films and series in between, by restoring the ""connection"" between man and the apes that was originally conceived and exhibited between Taylor (Charlton Heston) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) & Zira (Kim Hunter).Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) started by (re)establishing a strong (loving) relationship between man (James Franco's character) and ape, Caesar was the first chimpanzee that learns to speak. It gives a plausible reason for the development of his intellect, its spread among many other great apes (chimps, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans), and the resulting virus that proves deadly to man.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) reveals a remnant of virus- immune humans and their battle with the Caesar-led apes. Jason Clarke plays the human that 'connects' with Caesar, but this is the weakest of the three newer films. It's necessary because it affirms the distrust and strife between the species and establishes through Koba, a bonobo who'd been abused by man, that apes can be just as evil as man.In much the same way that Rogue One (2016) is for Star Wars (1977), War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) serves as a bridge to Planet of the Apes (1968), introducing characters and story lines that were realized in the original. Not an easy task for such a franchise. We meet Nova (Heston's squeeze) as a child, and learn why she couldn't speak, Cornelius (Roddy McDowell's character), and the orangutan that becomes the lawgiver, Maurice (a nod to the actor from the original).While there is plenty of war action in this one, what impressed this reviewer most was the humanity exhibited, by both man and (surprisingly) ape. Despite all the killing and violence between the two groups, there are tender - really beautiful - moments, even between those with the most animosity towards each other: Caesar and The Colonel, played by the ubiquitous Woody Harrelson. It's really quite well done, especially the character development, and highly recommended, especially for those with nostalgia for the first installment of the franchise.","9/10"
"jacobski-34770","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the final instalment of the franchise and a worthy conclusion for one of contemporary cinemas favourite characters.Does it live up to the expectations of the first three? No, but then again. No one was expecting it too.Did it surpass Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?Absolutely.Dial of Destiny"" faces the daunting task of living up to the legendary Indiana Jones trilogy, widely regarded as one of the greatest film series of all time.In its attempt to pay homage to its predecessors, the movie cleverly incorporates familiar elements like the ever-present Nazis, allowing Indy ample opportunity to unleash his trademark punches, and spine-chilling encounters with creepy-crawlies.While this nostalgic approach runs the risk of paling in comparison to the earlier films, director Mangold rises to the occasion, skillfully steering the action sequences with a refreshing and dynamic touch. His deep understanding of Indy's character is evident through the compelling character arc portrayed on screen, as well as a sprinkle of nihilism not dissimilar from what he did with Logan's character arch.Not to be overshadowed, John Williams' timeless score sweeps through the film with an air of grandeur, resonating with audiences from the first iconic notes. The music effortlessly transports viewers into the adventurous world of Indiana Jones, sending chills down their spines and setting the stage for a captivating journey.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny serves as a bittersweet but delightful swansong for Harrison Ford's iconic hero. While not without its flaws, the film embraces its imperfections and delivers an enjoyable experience that fans will appreciate. It often feels like a lovingly crafted ""greatest hits"" compilation, featuring familiar setpieces and relationships with a fresh twist. And you know what? That's perfectly fine.","3/10"

"jadepietro","15 May 2018","GRADE: B+THE FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.JIM'S REVIEW: The Planet of the Apes series has spanned 50 years with a very spotty record of hits and misses. The third chapter in this rebooted trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes, (totaling 8 remakes, including this 2017 film) is a wonderful offering of strong storytelling, fine acting, astute direction by Matt Reeves, and dazzling state-of-the-arts visuals.The story beleaguers its tale about the battle between man and apes. After all, this is a war movie, regardless of the species, but wisely focuses on the primates and their interplay and conflicts. The film fleshes out their individual traits and humanizes their plight.Andy Serkis once again plays Caesar, the leader of the retreating apes, and supplies voice and action to his character to maximum effect. Woody Harrelson is his blood-thirsty de-humanized adversary, known as The Colonel, a direct descendent of Col. Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. He is seen as pure evil and little time is spent on his character development, one of the film's minor flaws. Also bringing strong support is Steve Zahn as Bad Ape, Karin Konoval as Caesar's loyal friend, and Amiah Miller as the mute Nova.More time is spent on the action packed combat sequences. There is strong evidence of inspiration from other war films such as The Bridge Over the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and that aforementioned Coppola classic. However, the screenplay by Mark Bomback and the director mixes the ""human"" drama with its war scenes most effectively. (Kudos to Mr. Reeves for his strong direction as well which balances the dramatic narrative with epic staging usually found in blockbuster spectacles.)But its the film's Oscar-nominated visual look that champions this sci-fi adventure film. (It should have won.) Without the transfixing motion-capture design and CGI effects created by all the artisans behind the lenses, the film would not have worked so incredibly well. It is an impressive realistic blending of animation and acting that makes the story resonant. The production values are top-notch, especially taut editing by William Hoy and Stan Salfas and a diverse music score by Michael Giacchino that does not bombard the viewer with loud unnecessary fanfare. The series is bookended with its very best efforts and War for the Planet of the Apes, this franchises' possibly last installment, ranks among its finest achievements.","8/10"
"jadepietro","28 November 2012","This film is mildly recommended. Give me the real thing anytime! Sparkling rhinestones never trump diamonds. Plastic trees and silk flowers can never substitute for nature's glories. Artificial sweeteners are fine for awhile, but usually leave a funny aftertaste. Which brings us to Ang Lee's Life of Pi, a so-so entertainment that is long on style and short in substantial value.Overdone best describes this film. Visually, the film is a stunning work of art. ( I found the 3-D to be totally enthralling, almost too precise and overworked at times, but still a remarkable undertaking of this process. ) The film's color palette has an exciting vibrancy that is unmatched by other films, but also an artificial over-saturated glow, as if colors were boosted beyond their limits. There are scenes of true artistry that give this film a distinctive allure ( the staging of the actual shipwreck sequence, the surprise meeting of the boy and his tiger aboard the small lifeboat, a surrealistic hallucination that is filled with stark imagery, the colorful sunsets and ominous cloud reflecting upon the waters ). These effects do create an otherworldly atmosphere, which I suppose was Lee's goal, but the film's onslaught of phantasmagoric dreamscapes becomes excessive and outweighs the slenderest of plots: a philosophical and spiritual parable about a boy and his tiger lost at sea. This paradoxic metaphor is the basis conceit that enables the director and his screenwriter to explore the deeper meaning of religion, faith, and God that, in the end, makes Life of Pi become a preachy treacle, continually musing about our existence in this vast universe. ( Recent films by major directors like Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life, Lars van Trier's Melancholia, and the recent Cloud Atlas by the Wachowskis have explored this territory with similar mixed results. So one cannot fault Ang Lee with his passion and determination to film this novel and its metaphysical ruminations. ) Ultimately where Lee's film fails is in its conventional storytelling. The screenplay literally sinks the movie. Its script by David Magee rambles on and is especially slow-moving in the first half hour of the film with all its tedious exposition and build-up prior to the shipwreck. Based on Yann Martel's novel, the plot set-up is told in flashback, with the adult Pi bookending the more exciting adventure storyline. As he narrates his tale of survival, the character of the younger Pi ( Suraj Sharma ) emerges, but he is never fully realized. He is merely a pawn in this sea of woe. More time and success is spent on the exquisite photo-realistic rendering of Bengal tiger nicknamed Richard Parker. The CGI enhanced Mr. Parker gives a more lifelike performance and upstages the real life actor, Mr. Sharma, who could use some acting lessons. This imbalance sacrifices a real emotional gravitas needed to really care about the central character which I found completely missing in the film. ( In fact, the tiger had a lot more patience that I would have had if I was on that lifeboat and had to subject myself to Pi's religious rants and whining. He clearly would have been dinner by midday. ) Life of Pi is slightly adrift, a film full of excesses and self-important swagger. Lee overindulges his vision and seems more preoccupied in creating an ethereal world that is quite beautiful and strange to behold but, contrary to his own beliefs, it is also quite annoying to experience all of its religious dogma too. The overall effect of Life of Pi is a mixed blessing, so to speak. Life of Pi is a visually impressive achievement in filmmaking, but it remains intellectually and emotionally off-course. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Years ago, there was a wonderful film based on a children's novel called The Black Stallion which followed a similar storyline: a boy and an animal are shipwrecked and need each other to survive the hardships they face together. That film used a visual, almost wordless narrative to connect story and imagery; this film relies too heavily on the imagery to connect the pretentiousness of its hollow and holiest of words.","10/10"

"jafar-iqbal","11 December 2012","A young writer travels to Canada to meet Pi (Irrfan Khan), an Indian man with an incredible story to tell. It is the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma), who gets stranded in the Pacific Ocean with only a fearsome Bengal tiger to keep him company. The two castaways form a strange bond as they try to stay alive and get help.That's the story of Life Of Pi, the novel written by Yann Martel back in 2001. For nearly ten years the international bestseller was deemed unfilmable, despite numerous attempts. It was only when Ang Lee took control that the movie became a reality, and it has finally hit the big screen.The result of Ang Lee's attempts is an epic piece of cinema. The film is absolutely brilliant, with just the right amount of humour, emotion and action to satisfy everyone. I've not read the book yet (I will, for sure), but I get the feeling that justice was done here in regards to the adaptation. Characters are properly fleshed out, major and minor, and relationships are developed well enough to matter as the film goes on. If anything could have been explored better, it would be the relationship between Pi and his mother (Tabu). The influence she has on his life seems understated, and not in a good way.Life Of Pi is very much a work of fiction; at no point are we led to believe that it is based on reality, and this works massively in the filmmakers' favour. Unlike Zemeckis' Castaway, which is rooted in the reality of it all, Lee opts to focus more on the fantastical and beautiful. There is no real sense of time, and we aren't always told how certain things happen. They just do, and the story moves along.There are two things that stand out about this movie, and one thing that lets it down sorely. The good first. Suraj Sharma, as Pi, is excellent. Considering he has no acting experience, he is a revelation. And secondly, the movie is visually stunning. Absolutely beautiful from first frame to last. It's a visceral treat.Now the bad. I watched the film in 3D, and thought many times: why is this in 3D? I counted literally two moments where the 3D worked well. Other than that, it was useless. If the money spent on 3D was spent on shooting it in IMAX, Life Of Pi could have been even better. Instead, it was a bit darker than it needed to be, and everyone sits in a cinema looking like Stevie Wonder for no reason.The good heavily outweighs the bad, though, and I highly recommend the movie. Like with Avatar, the movie should be seen for the visuals alone. Unlike Avatar though, this is actually a good film. You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll be engrossed with them, and you'll feel a genuine sense of rejoice as everything unravels. I can't tell you if the movie is better or worse than the book. I can tell you that that doesn't matter here: the movie is excellent all on it's own.","9/10"
"jalidav1980","26 April 2019","Well first off, Infinity War is one of my favourite movies of all time, and I feel the expectations I had built from that, has impacted how I feel about this movie.Their are some really beautiful scenes and some great fan service which deserves a mention, in a movie that feels like a stepping stone to promote some of the characters that recently failed in the comics. We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of the MCUNow onto the movie:The plot line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like in Dragon all we can just ""Wish back"" all those who died. Its basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.Once again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny, fat child with mommy issuesAlthough there were some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little in the way of action and because the story was so all over the place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished in this movie.As always Tony is amazing, throwing out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great too.Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it, but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the plot. Like they were more concerned with paying homage to EVERY character ever, before writing a great narrative.","4/10"
"jalvarad","13 August 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is another modern reboot of a sci-fi series that has entertained generations of moviegoers since its beginning in 1968. So, it is no surprise that the new reincarnation has done remarkably well at the box office. However, unless you main criterion for watching movies is the pure fascination that comes from special effects, you will certainly be disappointed by it. The movie starts basically where the previous one left it off. From that point forward, it is hard to grasp the main story-line since bits of distracting scenes are poorly woven in the fabric of the plot. Moreover, the intractable plot comes across as being too dark with themes such as revenge, punishment, and mercy killings (and suicide) that hardly make the movie entertaining unless one is easily distracted by the special effects and battle scenes that continuously take over the movie. In the end, it basically becomes clear that director Matt Reeves has little appreciation for structure and is more interested in pleasing those that have short-term memory spans and/or easily excited by eye-catching specials effects of apes' facial expressions and combat scenes. Let's hope that the next Apes' movie would have more things to offer, at least for entertainment purposes.","8/10"

"JamesHitchcock","15 January 2013","The central character in this film is Piscine Molitor Patel, named for some reason after a swimming pool in Paris even though his family are from Pondicherry in India. As a boy, young Piscine Molitor, tired of being taunted with the nickname ""Pissing Patel"" by his schoolmates, changes his name to ""Pi"" after the mathematical symbol. Yes, it's that sort of a film. As the film opens Pi Patel is now an adult living in Montreal, Canada. He is approached by a local writer who believes that Pi's life story would make a great subject for a book. Pi therefore relates that life story to him, so most of the film consists of one long flashback. We learn of his childhood in Pondicherry, where his father owns a zoo. Most of the story, however, takes place when Pi is 16. His father decides to emigrate with the family to Canada, and closes the zoo. He books a passage to Canada on a Japanese freighter, taking all his animals with him on the ship, as he believes that he will get a better price for them in North America than in India. Halfway across the Pacific the ship is wrecked in a storm, and Pi is the only survivor. He manages to struggle onto a lifeboat but finds he must share it with several animals- a zebra, an orangutan, a spotted hyena and a Bengal tiger.The film is notable for its use of computer-generated digital imagery to render the animals, especially the tiger, and the technological aspects are certainly most impressive. The scenes in the lifeboat could, clearly, not have been filmed with real animals, but the ""virtual"" animals we see are so realistically done that we are persuaded to suspend our disbelief. The film is also, at times, visually very beautiful, as one might expect from Ang Lee, the director of that poetic ballet ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Lee's poetic vision is seen most clearly in the scenes set at sea, particularly the one where the entire ocean seems to be covered with jellyfish shining in the moonlight. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi is clearly a promising newcomer, although I was less impressed by Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi, and there is a brief but memorable cameo from Gérard Depardieu as a vulgar, racist ship's cook. My main problem with the film was that I could not really see the point of it. It was clearly intended as something more than just an exciting yarn about a shipwreck; indeed, it does not work particularly well as an adventure film because the non-realistic elements keep getting in the way. A film with a hero who is named after both a swimming pool and a mathematical symbol, who miraculously survives a considerable period of time in a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger and who encounters a mysterious floating island populated by carnivorous plants and meerkats- creatures native to southern Africa, not Pacific islands- is obviously not intended to be realistic. It must have some hidden meaning. But what is it?There is a religious note running through the film. Pi's father is a free-thinking rationalist, but Pi himself is deeply religious- so much so that he follows three religions, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, all at once. The ship on which the family travels is, although Japanese, named the Tsimtsum, a Hebrew word with a technical meaning in Jewish theology. Pi tells the writer who is interviewing him that he has a story that will ""make you believe in God"", but the implications of this are never really thought through. A story which is not only fictitious but also fantastic seems a curious argument for the existence of God. Even if one were to be confronted with a story like Pi's which was undoubtedly true, one could always choose to regard his seemingly miraculous survival as being due purely to good fortune rather than to divine intervention.I have not read Yann Martel's original novel, but to judge from this adaptation it would appear to be a work of ""magic realism"", a literary genre which combines the realistic with the fantastic, and which often works better on the printed page than on the cinema screen. There have been many notable literary works in this genre in recent decades, but few have been successfully adapted for the cinema, and the few great ""magic realist"" films, such as Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", have generally been based on original screenplays. Bille August made a very decent version of Isabel Allende's ""The House of the Spirits"", but he did so by concentrating on the realist elements in Allende's novel at the expense of the magic ones. ""Life of Pi"" is technically very impressive, and it has some excellent individual scenes, but it never really unites these into a coherent work of art. 6/10","10/10"
"jamesjustice-92","8 September 2023","It's been a long time since I first got myself a pirate VHS copy of The kingdom of the crystal skull and sank into it. Ever since childhood Indiana Jones was one of my favorite characters, the sole reason I became interested in archeology and everything ancient and Harrison Ford was there to guide me in my passion for history. The first three movies were masterpieces of entertainment hands down, the fourth was, well, a different, almost an alien piece of work but it was driven by the energy of father and son relationship hence it was also a good fun movie.As I sat and watched The dial of destiny I felt the movie's alien nature once again only this time it was in a bad way. Don't get me wrong it's filled with action to the brim, so much so that if you blink you'll miss some fantastic eye-dropping shot but all in all it is a bland uninspired body of work written by four people and none of them was George Lucas or Steven Spielberg.The dial of destiny could have easily been a different movie if it hadn't had Indiana Jones before it and that name alone should put a stamp of high quality on it which there wasn't. The characters are dumb and have no motivation, no stamina, no nothing to hold onto; the villains are your usual goonies with half a brain and even Mads Mikkelsen wasn't able to bring life to his just another ex-Nazi character with God's syndrome.Harrison Ford himself is old and tired as his character who should have been retired many years ago; he clearly didn't want to be Indiana Jones anymore, as much as Han Solo and he shows it in every frame with his wooden acting and one facial expression.Yes, they added a tea spoon of drama to Indiana but forgot to pour tea first which in the end turned out to be a sugary sweet version of a farewell party for Jones and Co. The adventure is mind-blowing though and the scene in Syracuse is absolutely the best part of the whole movie but overall The dial of destiny is pretty forgettable and it is an unnecessary addition to the world of the greatest archeologist with a whip and a hat but I nevertheless am glad this movie happened - to prove once again that Hollywood can never make a worthy continuation of an iconic movie.","6/10"

"jamoe-49431","16 November 2019","The heroes leaving it out all there and sacrificing their lives in the end really speaks to the soul. Black widow fighting to sacrifice herself was so sad and beautiful at the same time. I cried when Iron Man finally let go. Gwyneth Paltrow absolutely crushed it in that scene, her telling him that they're gonna be ok and he can let go...😭. Gut-wrenching! Emotional scenes all over; Captain America seeing his love for the first time in ages throw the window with the blinds, that was great stuff. Iron Man's relationship with his daughter...just all kinds of really awesome moments. Heroes were brave and sacrificial, they showed true love and it was awesome. There were a couple liberal-ish, pseudophilosophical bits here and there. ""Don't be who you're supposed to be, be who you are."" Sounds like irresponsible rubbish to me. The redefining of what a hero by Thor's Mom made no sense, but it was brief and negligible. And the little moment where all the girls get together to fight was patronizing in my opinion.
Yes, some of the writing was cheesy. It wasn't as bad as some are complaining about. The 3 hours didn't feel bad to me. The movie kept moving along and kept me engaged and interested. Anyone who gets that bent out of shape about the time travel stuff needs to just stop watching movies. If you can't suspend your belief at all you can't enjoy a movie. Captain America being able to wield Thor's hammer was cool but I have no idea where that came from. But I also didn't really care at that point. It didn't offend me and it was fun and it didn't take away from anything good in the fim. The score was good, visuals were 10/10 of course. The final battle scene was the best large battle on screen since LOTR battles. It was really good, I am looking forward to watching it again sometime!","8/10"
"Jampierre","4 February 2024","It has been years since I've seen a movie that keeps you entertained basically the entire time. The dialogue is genuinely fun. They do a great job of making you really hate the ""bad guys."" The complete implausibility of the plot actually adds to the appeal, and you really don't care. It's a ""good guy vs. Evil guy"" adventure. You don't have to think too hard. Great action scenes, comedic breaks, and all-around good time. I usually enjoy historical fiction, documentaries, and movies that generally make you think, so it's nice to have something like this that allows you to just relax and enjoy. Highly recommended.","8/10"
"jandrfilms","9 December 2021","Anything that has to do with the Avengers, Marvel comics in general, I'm there with bells and whistles on. Love these types of movies, like I said, I'm a comic book geek.The scenes were outstanding, Thanos fighting all of the Avengers and then some who wasn't Avengers joined in to beat this evil foe. I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.Maybe Dr. Strange can go back to that moment and change the coarse of history and still keep the ending the same, by allowing Tony Stark to live but still killing off Thanos...hmm, interesting concept, HEY MARVEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?","8/10"
"janpnacek5","30 March 2019","The story of this movie is simple but it is quite nice and shows some history too. But what makes this movie a gem is the animation. I've never been a huge fan of DB animation but this one is the best of the best. Absolute amazing feast for the eyes.","10/10"
"januaryman-1","23 November 2012","Life of Pi is stunning, beautiful, and philosophical with a tantalizing lack of absolute resolution. The movie is a visual masterpiece. I gasped at many of the images contained within it. (See it on a big screen.) I know the Pi contains a mix of digital artistry and live action, but, for the life of me, I could not see the seams between them.The only problem I had with the film was that I had difficulty understanding the accented English at times. This decreased as the story progresses and I grew more accustomed to the Indian cadence. Speaking of India, Life of Pi gives a vision of an India that I had never pictured.What I believed would be the ending of a bittersweet story was turned on end by a late twist artfully introduced to remove any hint of contrivance. It was impossible to have dry eyes by the end of Life of Pi, and the last few minutes of the film will have me thinking about it for months or years or maybe the rest of my life.This movie has my vote for best picture of the year as well as a half-dozen other awards.","10/10"
"JapanMovies","30 August 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks another captivating addition to the Indiana Jones film series. It's speculated that this could be the final installment, with Harrison Ford reprising his role as the iconic Indiana Jones for possibly one last time. While Ford may not be performing his own stunts due to his age, his acting skills remain top-notch and impressive. The film's enhanced graphics are visually stunning and add to the thrilling action-packed storyline that fans have come to love. The desire to watch this film repeatedly is undeniable, leaving viewers with a longing for more. For those who have followed Ford's acting career over the years, this film is a fitting end to his portrayal of Indiana Jones.","9/10"
"Jared_Andrews","26 July 2017","If you have forgotten what happened in the first two movies, don't worry. ""War"" opens with a clear and concise recap of the events leading up to this movie. It's a smart way to commence and an indication of the thoughtful nature with which this movie was made.The movie obviously depicts a literal war for planet between the humans and the apes. There's also a figurative and less obvious war going on—one for Caesar's soul. The movie is really about Caesar's battle to remain pure and free from hate in world that corrupted Koba and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson).This question remains open for much of the movie, as we see for the first time some real cracks in Caesar's previously infallible morals. He has real reasons to give into the hatred (as you will see), and his humanity is truly tested. It all boils down to one scene, which of course, I will not spoil. A bit is left to interpretation, but I personally found clarity in the scene and settled comfortably on my answer.This movie fulfills anything and everything you could possibly desire in the final installment of this trilogy. The action sequences deliver intensity and genuine feelings of danger. This wasn't like many movies of this sort where the ""good guys"" sort of seem invincible. Everyone felt vulnerable, which amplified the suspense greatly. Additionally, the storytelling is flawless. It's littered with foreshadowing, eye-popping imagery, and provocative social parallels.While the excellent visuals and storytelling were expected, there were also two elements that took me aback by how well they were executed. The first was the dialogue, which honored the Apes' basic vocabulary and still managed to showcase the depths of their awareness. The other element was the performances of the actors playing apes.This may sound strange to say, but I think Andy Serkis deserves serious Academy Award consideration. His gravitas and emotional complexity come across clearly even though he never actually appears on screen.Caesar is one of the most deeply fascinating and thoughtful characters in recent movie memory, as evidenced by his growth over these three movies. It's time Serkis received proper recognition for bringing Caesar to life.","9/10"
"Jared_Andrews","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.","3/10"

After watching Across the Spider-Verse, I can easily say that this movie was phenomenal in every way possible from beginning to end. It's easily my 2nd favorite Spider-Man Movie just behind Spider-Man 2 (2004). I can honestly say that if Beyond the Spider-Verse is just as phenomenal or even better than this movie, then the Spider-Verse Trilogy will forever go down in history as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. This movie is absolutely a must watch for both Superhero & Animated movie fans.A Perfect 10/10!!!!!","10/10"
"JaredLegend","31 May 2023","It was nothing short of spectacular and amazing. I didn't think they could surpass the animation of the first one, but this one clearly did. I was tearing up, not only because of how emotional it gets, but because of how beautiful the visuals are. I really liked that it was just good animation for the sake of good animation, because believe me, it was really good. But the good animation also served as somewhat of a way to differentiate between different universes. And by conditioning the viewers into thinking this, the twist is able to really shock them when it is revealed. Already can't wait for the next one!","8/10"
"jascoward","2 July 2023","The first Spiderverse film was excellent. Everything worked like a charm. Sometimes we have to choose between amazing special effects and a good story with strong character growth. Every now and again you get a film on the level with Roger Rabbit.Out of this trilogy, they have already given us two magnificent story's. It's like Toy Story where you are in awe of the visual presentation. People like me appreciate when you can see the heart and hard work on the screen. Apparently some studios believe throwing absurd amounts of 💸 at the production crew and a good movie will just suddenly appear. When you hire artists with a vision and a passion to inspire the crew to believe in the magic being conjured, then a quality film appears. Life is hard all over and it is a blessing when they give us a product we can treasure. I know the pressure is at 💯%, but I pray they get what they need to finish this partial masterpiece.","10/10"

Let by Harrison Ford and a great supporting cast, Indy takes us on one last adventure and I just loved every minute of it and it's a shame it has to end.I really enjoyed the storyline and the cameos kept coming and Phoebe was a great foil for Indy throughout.Whether your a past fan or not, you have to watch it.I'll be back again and again for this one and I now feel like watching the whole series over again.Give 'em hell Indiana Jones, we still luv ya!","6/10"
"jasonperronesr","10 July 2023","This movie is 100% action, 0% story, 0% heart. The only way this qualifies as an ""Indiana Jones"" movie is that it features Indiana Jones. Other than that, it's just mindless action with no story at all. It was a mistake to have an Indiana Jones movie not directed by Steven Spielberg. Even John Williams' heart was clearly not in this. For a while, I was wondering if he even did the music. Just disappointing on many levels. The whole beginning of the movie was unnecessary to the story. It could have just as easily been something mentioned in a conversation between two characters. And all of the artifacts that Indy ever dealt with, the Dial is the most pointless.","1/10"
"jasonperronesr","17 July 2017","No spoilers. All I will say is I HIGHLY recommend War for the Planet of the Apes if you suffer from insomnia. What a boring train-wreck of a movie. I would have slept through it if I wasn't so irritated by the music. I've always been on the fence about whether Michael Giacchino is a good composer or not, but this settles it for me. He sucks. And Matt Reeves should give up directing and somebody needs to break his hands before he attempts to write anything ever again. A movie so bad it ruins the rest of the franchise. Even Charlton Heston is spinning in his grave.","6/10"
"jaspercobar","25 June 2023","Spider Man across the spider verse was nearly perfect. The only flaw was the ending. It did rap up well though. Gwen assembled a Spider Man team to find Miles, Miles went to a universe were his uncle was still alive, and that Miles was the Prowler. So it really did get me excited for the next one, but at the same time I was pissed off that I have to wait another year to see it. It was a cliffhanger, but a good one. The ending could of been worse though, because I thought it was going to end with the Spot arriving in Gwen's current universe, and start attacking Miles's Dad. Just imagine that cliffhanger. Other then the ending, the movie was perfect. It had an amazing soundtrack, amazing action, amazing comedy. Amazing acting. The best part though was the small cameos, e.g when it showed the lady from the dairy in Venom, and Donald Glover as the Prowler. I'd recommend this movie, but not for little kids, because the plot is to confusing. It involves a lot of multiverse madness, that you really have to pay attention in order to understand.","10/10"
"javierubio","23 September 2022","Good Story and Picture is very colorful! Specially when Pi was stranded in the Ocean at night and the spectacle with the whales , the fish was fantastic!

"jay632","4 June 2023","To be quite honest, the first one was unique, but i didn't think it was great. This movie took everything it learned from part 1 and made vast improvements on every level.This was the multiverse movie i was looking for that the mcu just never did properly. The worlds had depth and not just skipping through it as fast as possible without a chance to digest it.Story was good too, i wasn't expecting much, since we already got the backstory in part 1. But they did a great job expanding the story.Animation also improved from part 1, it was really unique, but they just made it better.By far my favorite part are the cameo's of different spidermans. There's so many, this is fan service done right.","10/10"

However, the storyline really starts to pick up in the second half.For the most part, the acting was really good with great performances with from the main cast of the movie. However there are cameos in this movie that seem like a money grab.The visuals and effects portrayed in the movie stand out more than most marvel movies in the past.

This isn't something memorable but if you're a marvel fan would leave you excited for the future of the MCU.","7/10"
"JayWolfgramm","11 June 2023","I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.","7/10"
"JayWolfgramm","12 March 2023","Broly as a character always seemed interesting in concept. Not just an evil super saiyan, but the super saiyan of legend. But all, and I do mean ALL previous movies with the character failed to make him interesting. In all three of his previous movies he would just run around shouting ""Kakarot"" and smashing things up. Pretty much like the Hulk but without any solid alter ego. This movie takes those lemons and makes Lemonade.This is Broly's best movie. They do change a bit of continuity for him, and it is for the better. This time around, Broly is basically a Tarzan. He has been raised in a wild environment and has had to get stronger from necessity to survive on that planet. He hasn't been trained to fight, but all the strength is there. His motivation this time around also makes more sense. Instead of being mad at Goku for crying next to him as a baby, he is mad at Vegeta because his father tried to have him, and his father killed. That is a far more compelling motive.Not only is this Broly's best movie, it is Bardock's best movie. A good portion of this movie is devoted to reintroducing fans to the backstory of three different Saiyans: Goku, Vegeta and Broly. In order to do that, the movie flashes back to planet Vegeta and shows the situation befoe Frieza fully takes over and does his thing. This does age up Goku and makes his back story a little too identical to Superman but I am OK with that.The movie certainly has a pacing issue. Most of the first half is exposition, set up and character growth. Not a typical first half for a Dragon Ball movie, but a welcome change of pace. The movie is like reading a book and then watching a fireworks show. A lot of character stuff and then all at once explosion after explosion.Frieza is here as well and has some all-time great moments working off of Broly and Paragus. Cheelai and Lime are the best new characters introduced in the series since Beerus and Whis. Cheelai and Broly have a real Tarzan and Jane feel to them.It is a different animation style than the show and sometimes that works for its benefit, but other times the animation quality seems to really drop. I also don't care for the music that does nothing but chant the characters names over and over again.All in all, this is a real solid entry into the Dragon Ball movie universe. So good that I can't wait for it to be folded into the series proper. Not just a good Dragon Ball movie, but a good animated movie in general. It is deserving of the title of ""Super"".","10/10"
"JayWolfgramm","21 May 2023","The movie has a lot of little problems. Problems that, on their own wouldn't be all that distracting. In a better put together film, most could write them off as ""nitpicks"". But when the story and characters are not engaging enough, these little problems really add up, and the movie suffers death by 1000 cuts.The ""Quantum Realm"" is not that visually interesting. It looks like all the actors filmed their scenes separately on a green screen. The realm itself is just a series of browns and oranges like an old dusty screw. You don't get any sense of size in this movie. When Ant-Man is in the real world he will interact with objects we are familiar with. We know he is big because he is compared to a boat or an airplane. In the Quantum Realm there is no scaling. There is a scene where two characters are supposedly giant, but since they are just the same size as each other, they look like normal people.Back when Janet was in the Quantum Realm, she helped out Jonathan Majors fix his ship. But then she discovered that he was evil. How did she discover this? For some reason his spaceship is fueled by his mind...so Janet touching the ship made it so she could read his mind. Not very well explained and it doesn't make much sense. Feels like the writers were hoping to come up with an explanation later but just never did. They needed her to find out he was evil, so she just found out, end of story. A big plot point surrounds the idea that Janet doesn't want to tell any of her family about this interaction. Why? The movie tries to imply that she feels guilty or traumatized about it. But I don't buy it, it is just so drama can happen between Hope and Janet, otherwise Hope has nothing to do in this movie.MODOK is terrifying for all the wrong reasons. Every time he is on screen, I am immediately wanting him to leave. His character arc also makes no sense.Speaking of things that make no sense, Jonathan Majors' powerset fluctuates wildly depending on what the plot demands. It seems like he should win easily, but then when the third act approaches, suddenly he makes a lot of stupid decisions and is capable of killing everyone except for the main characters.Cassie is super annoying. She is a self-righteous, entitled know it all that keeps getting vindicated.I liked Jonathan Majors in the movie. And unlike other Marvel movies, I actually was fine with the comedy in this movie. It was an appropriate level of humor for this character. I enjoyed that the movie does not waste much time in getting the story going. The story begins and ends with a good pace.Overall, the rules of their world don't add up. Characters seem to change with no believable motivation. Some characters are just annoying. The visuals are unappealing. So yes, a lot of these could have been forgiven but it is all the small things the movie does wrong. Of all people, Ant-Man should know the power of small things.","8/10"

"jboothmillard","20 January 2013","From Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain), I saw the trailer and reviews for this film, most said it was a films that you had to see in 3D, so I went to see it in the hope it would be worth it. Basically, a Writer (Rafe Spall, Timothy's son) has been told that immigrant Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Irrfan Khan) from Pondicherry, India, now living in Montreal, Canada, has an amazing story to tell, and he is keen to hear it for his next book, and it starts by explaining that he was named after a swimming pool, Piscine Molitar, his first name being pronounced ""pissing"", so he changed it to Pi, like the maths term. In flashback, we see his family owned a zoo, five year old Pi (Gautam Belur) gained an interest in animals, especially Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger named due to a clerical error, he even puts himself in danger trying to feed it, his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) forcing him to watch it kill a goat to show its carnivorous nature. Twelve year old Pi (Ayush Tandon) is raised Hindu and vegetarian, but he finds interest in the Christian and Islam religions as well, he follows all three at once, and later in life he would lecture in Kabbalah at university. Aged sixteen Pi (Orange Rising Star Award nominated Suraj Sharma) is devastated when the family closing the zoo to move to Canada, meaning the animals will be sold, so they all board a Japanese freighter called Tsimtsum, with a rude cook (Gérard Depardieu) on board. One night the ship encounters a heavy storm, causing it to sink, Pi tries to find his family, but he is thrown into a lifeboat by the crew, all he can do is watch the ship go down with the crew and his family drowning. Alone in the middle of the ocean he is joined by an injured zebra and an orangutan, but he gets a shock from a spotted hyena who jumps out and kills the zebra and mortally wounds the orangutan, but the real shock is Richard Parker jumping out and killing the hyena. To keep himself safe from the tiger Pi finds food rations and builds himself a smaller raft to float a safe distance next to the lifeboat, and he feeds the tiger caught fish to protect himself from the animal, and he collects rain water for both of them to drink, and he shows compassion putting a ladder on the lifeboat to help the tiger out of the ocean when it jumps in. One night a large whale comes out of the water, and it causes many of the supplies to disappear, and starving he can only eat raw fish, and he realises to survive he should be able to get in the boat with the tiger, so over time he trains Richard Parker to let him in, and he finds that helping the tiger is keeping him alive. Near the point of exhaustion and with hardly any strength the lifeboat drifts during the night onto a floating island with a forest, edible plants, fresh water pools and hundreds of meerkats, so Pi and the tiger can regain their strength, but time passes and water turns acidic killing the fish, and he finds the plants are carnivorous, so collecting supplies they leave the island. After a long time at the sea the lifeboat finally reaches land, the coast of Mexico, Pi crawls onto land and rests on the sand, and he sees tiger Richard Parker walking towards the jungle and briefly stopping, he expects it to look back and acknowledge him, but he eventually walks through and is never seen again, while Pi is rescued by people who take him to hospital, he weeps because of the tiger leaving him. In hospital the sinking of the freighter is causing concern for some insurance agents, and they want to hear the account from the only known survivor, he tells the story he has which they do not believe, so then he fabricates a tale that is less fantastic but believable that he was in the lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg, and the cook. In present day the Writer is asked by adult Pi which story he believes and prefers, he finds the parallels in the story that he concocted for the insurance guys, and he answers that he finds the story with the tiger much more incredible, 227 days at sea was a remarkable feat, and he is allowed to take this story to use for a novel. Also starring Tabu as Gita Patel, Andrea Di Stefano as the Priest and Shravanthi Sainath as Anandi. Newcomer Sharma gives a very endearing performance as the young man struggling against the odds to survive, computer animated tiger Richard Parker is a convincing character because he is so realistic looking, I completely agree that this has to be seen in 3D, for the appearance of the tiger, the exciting sequences with storms, whales and underwater moments, you could argue it is similar to Cast Away, but on a boat, and there should be a little more plot, but it has the moments of tension, you sympathise with the characters, and it really feels like a journey to watch, a great fun adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music, Original Score for Mychael Danna, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Song for ""Pi's Lullaby"", Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Music, Best Production Design, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

"jboothmillard","22 July 2017","The Planet of the Apes movies have been going since 1968, and the recent reboot series has been very successful, Rise of... being very good, and Dawn of... being fantastic, so I was hoping the third would also be great, directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In, Rise of the Planet of the Apes). Basically it has been 15 years since the ALZ-113 virus, or the Simian Flu, spread across the globe killing billions of people, following the previous events, the highly intelligent apes, led by chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) have remained in the woods. The apes are attacked by a military faction known as Alpha-Omega, a group of soldiers, who have also recruited service apes who followed Koba (Toby Kebbell), the bonobo who previously failed a coup against Caesar, some AO militants are captured and reveal that they follow the leadership of a ruthless Colonel (Woody Harrelson). The prisoners are released as a peace offering to the humans, but Caesar plans to relocate the clan across the desert, not wanting to suffer any more ape casualties, but during the night Alpha-Omega infiltrates the apes' base, and the Colonel kills Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer), and their eldest son Blue Eyes (Max Lloyd-Jones). Leaving his younger son Cornelius (Devyn Dalton) and the other apes to head for the desert, Caesar departs to exact revenge on the Colonel, accompanied by Maurice the orangutan (Karin Konoval), Luca the gorilla (Michael Adamthwaite) and Rocket the chimpanzee (Terry Notary). Caesar's party are confronted by traitorous albino gorilla Winter (Aleks Paunovic) in an Alpha- Omega camp, they learn the Colonel has departed for a location called the ""border"", Caesar inadvertently kills Winter, causing him to have visions of Koba, he worries he is becoming like him. During their journey, they find an abandoned village, there is a man who they kill when he reaches for his rifle, then they discover his daughter (Amiah Miller), who is unable to speak, Maurice insists they take her with them. Further along, they discover some Alpha-Omega soldiers who have been shot and abandoned, there is a survivor, and examining him they find he is like the mute girl, unable to speak. Later the group meet chimpanzee hermit Bad Ape (Steve Zahn), who before the Simian Flu pandemic lived in the Sierra Zoo, he directs them to the border, a former weapons depot turned into a quarantine facility after the virus began to spread. Arriving at the facility, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from an Alpha-Omega patrol, Caesar is motivated to proceed alone, he witnesses the rest of his ape clan being forced into slavery, building a wall, with no food or water, then Caesar is captured by militant gorilla Red (Ty Olsson). Caesar comes face to face with the Colonel, he reveals that the Simian Flu virus has mutated, it now causes humans who survived the original strain to become mute and regress back to a primitive state, the Colonel is barricading himself in the facility, he believes the solution is to kill any infected humans, including his own son, to stop the spread of the virus. While Caesar is tortured with starvation, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion, so the mute girl, whom Maurice names Nova, can sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food and water. Together, Caesar and Rocket plan an escape, using underground tunnels leading out of the facility, Maurice and Bad Ape use the tunnel to rescue the apes, Caesar orders them to make get away, while he goes to confront the Colonel. The facility comes under attack by rival military who want to defeat AO, Caesar reaches the Colonel, but realises he has been infected by the mutated virus, he spares his life, but the Colonel kills himself, rather than exist as a primitive. During the battle between Alpha-Omega and the rival militants, the escaping apes come under fire from AO, Caesar attempts to attack them from behind, but he is shot by human militant Preacher (Gabriel Chavarria), whom he previously set free. Red saves Caesar at the cost of his own life, and Caesar blows up the facility's fuel supplies, causing an explosion and avalanche, the Alpha-Omega are wiped and the rival militants are triumphant, but the human forces are buried by the avalanche, the apes and Nova survive by climbing nearby trees. In the end, the remaining apes depart the facility and cross the desert to find a paradise- like oasis, the apes joyously celebrate finding their new home, but Maurice discovers Caesar is fatally wounded, Caesar assures him the apes will progress with or without him, and that he will be remembered, he quietly dies. Serkis remains poignant and assertive under the motion- captured, while Harrelson as the power-crazed villain is almost too similar to Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, he cannot compete with Marlon Brando, obviously the special effects have become more advanced, making the CGI creatures and action much more realistic and incredible, and it is nice to see little bits from the original films returning, e.g. a silent girl named Nova, the big problem with this sequel is that story is not as thought-provoking as before, it is slow the majority of the time, only the fight sequences are memorable, it is unclear if the series will continue, a disappointing but reasonable science-fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Okay!","10/10"
"jburtroald95","7 January 2013","Ang Lee, the Taiwanese director of films such as Sense and Sensibility (2000) and Lust Caution (2007), has decided to give his latest maturely themed feature the visual aesthetic of a charming children's adventure tale. As such, all trailers, posters and inattentively viewed clips of the film make it seem like the perfect holiday fodder for little ones. The parents who brought their toddlers to the session of Life of Pi that I went to weren't entirely incorrect in their assumptions. It is a magical movie, it does tell a fanciful story, and the effect on its audience is altogether uplifting, but the fantastical element is laid on top of a hard, heavy realism that pokes through more than one might expect. The real world isn't blocked out of the piece like an escapist kid's film: it is contrasted against the spiritual fantasy as a way of showing, not telling, its audience why people turn to religion even when modern science seems to constantly conflict with it.Young Pi Patel (played by Gautam Belur, and then Ayush Tandon as an 11- to-12-year-old) has been fascinated by religion since he tried to vandalise a catholic church in rural India, where he and his family own an extensive zoo, and encountered astonishing Christian forgiveness. Since then he has also become a Muslim, and confounded his strict father (Adil Hussain) and the young author (Rafe Spall) that he relates his tale too, which we see in extended flashbacks, with his apparent juvenile miscomprehension that is actually an insightful observation that Hinduism, Islamism and Christianity all really achieve the same end, and simply imagine God in different forms. The interspersed scenes between the reminiscing adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) and the curious writer mostly feel as artificial and unnecessary as such setups always are, with the exception of the protagonist's poignant account of the melancholy end to his relationship with Richard Parker, the fierce but magnificent tiger that everyone has seen on the posters, and his introductory proclamation to the writer that this is a story that will make him believe in God, and I suppose there needs to be someone there for him to say this to, but anyone would do.It takes a surprisingly long time for the teenage Pi (played extraordinarily well by first-timer Suraj Sharma) to be on the lifeboat alone with Richard out on the open ocean wearing a turban, there being a considerable early portion of the film devoted to his family life, but the introduction of the prevalent theme of spirituality runs throughout and the bloodthirsty beauty of the big cat are crucial elements that come from these scenes. Even the mundane, but still mildly interesting, family exchanges, depictions of his school life – where we discover the amusing origin of his name – and a mercifully brief, obligatory romantic sub-plot, are necessary to again show us, not tell us, of his pain when he loses all of this in a shipwreck at about the halfway-point, and begins a compelling and visually stunning fight for his life against the elements, and the astonishingly realised tiger. All of the animals in the film are totally convincing, but it is especially impressive that all sides of the this incredible predator – his strength, his hunger, his nobility, his desperation, his feline grace – are all captured so beautifully, making the multi-faceted symbiotic relationship between the animal and his keeper so totally engrossing. Their gruelling search for land is depicted warts, and quite a few of those hideous warts, which may have been even more unrestrainedly gritty in the original novel by Yann Martel, were quickly driving all of those toddlers out of the cinema before any of them could discover how Pi's tale could defrost a person's rigid atheism, and a good thing too. The trick doesn't lie in his miraculous survival – that would have probably lost the other, older half of the underage audience – but in the very grisly, hard-hitting alternative ""real"" version of events that Pi tells a pair of reporters that don't believe the version we've seen, which is very reminiscent of John Steinbeck's Lifeboat, for which the fantastical tale seems to be an allegory. When Pi asks, ""So which story do you prefer?"" the hearts of both us and the writer of course unhesitatingly answer ""the one with the tiger,"" before our brains can interfere with shallow logical cynicism.While not for very little ones, parents should certainly take children past their single-digit years to see this wonderful telling of a robust but wondrous story of biblical beauty.","9/10"
"jcfuller-00305","22 February 2023","One of the most fun and weird movies I've seen in a while, which is mostly a compliment. I liked it! It was fun! I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer number of creatively new designs the quantum realm yielded, the probability storm scene in particular was one of my favorite MCU movie sequences of the past couple years. It really felt like a colorful comic book come to life. The blobby guy was a scene-stealer, though obviously he didn't reach the sheer comedic prowess of Luis, who was missed here. The Pym-Lang family were a great cast of characters to watch and even if the other 2 Ant-Man films may be the better two because of the tonal difference, it was still interesting to see them face a larger-scale threat, and the final battle of the civilians and the heroes versus Kang's army felt very tense and exciting....where has Jonathan Majors been the past decade?? This man can act like nobody's business. Kang was easily one of the best parts of the movie, his backstory with Janet was really intriguing and his unrelenting coldness in his methods was chilling, as was his massive displays of power. It'll be awesome to see him again down the road. MODOK was cool and funny, until his mask came off and I felt as though someone had poured sodium chloride into my eyeballs. Bill Murray was good but underused. I wished there was a little more time spent in San Fransisco (Jimmy Woo!) it felt like we had just barely re-established the characters before they were thrown into the quantum realm. Also, the second trailer for this movie made it seem as though Kang was going to tempt Scott with helping him regain time with Cassie that he lost over the blip, with dialogue that I'm pretty sure wasn't in the Final Cut discussing it (Kang even tells Janet at one point that he could send her back before she ever left her own family). I'm surprised they didn't go this route in the movie, instead having Kang's end of the bargain only being to not kill all of them. Overall though, the movie was really fun, weird, and visually pleasing, and a great time at the movies. The stakes felt higher than most MCU movies since we know Kang is going to be the next big villain and it felt like anything could happen with the timeline.Now, my opinion on the MCU movie prejudice that seems to be growing and growing: People keep dissing on these movies because they're not as 'refined' or something as other movies out there, but It's unfair to compare completely different genres with each other. People that want to say the MCU is too ""VFX heavy"" or ""Unserious"" need to realize that that's exactly what these types of movies are here to provide for audiences: a colorful, funny, adventurous story filled with superpowered heroes that fight evil. And audiences eat it up every time, it's clear that MCU movies are connecting with the general moviegoing public because every single release is a hit (some smaller than others, but still successful) and people keep coming back for more. Those who want to take shots at the aspects of MCU movies that are integral parts of MCU movies should just watch something else. I completely understand disliking these movies if one thinks they contain weaker superhero stories or weaker VFX or weaker comedy than usual, but one can't complain about it the existence of these different aspects in general when they're just pillars of what makes an MCU movie that people keep on coming back to for more. Sure, Quantumania wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a perfectly satisfying and fun romp through a superhero-filled world, which is exactly what I expected from it. If I wanted a movie without these aspects, I wouldn't watch it. Hope that made sense, and here's to more fun MCU outings.*exhales* but anyways, cool film. OWEN WILSON!!!!!!!!!","2/10"
"jchs","17 July 2017","Don't believe the hype surrounding this movie. This movie was awful. This movie was so much of a letdown that i had to write my first review on this website. The other two in the series are way better than this one. This movie was a bore! The planet of the apes with Mark Wahlberg was better than this one. I don't see how the script was even approved for this movie. The only positive was the CGI and that was wasted money since this movie sucked.","9/10"
"jcjs333","15 November 2017","The only thing i liked about the flick is some of the photo-jazz. Interesting how some reviewers like to critique other reviewers. I supposed that's natural. Funny, how the one reviewer said he was a coward for not leaving the theater halfway through and weeps for cinema. I get that. Another said the new SpiderMan was trash and can't understand people liking Spiderman and disliking this show. For me, each was junky bunky but for different reasons. The writing and plot were bad but this Planet of the Apes is just old and poor stuff. The first one was enough. Trying to anthropomorphize apes and God and anything else we can think of gets old. Being talked down to by Hollywood gets old with their main purpose, still, money. One monkey has 'stunted jabber' like Hollywood put in the mouths of early cowboy Indian movies, the Zoo Monkey. And, Ceasar is an articulate son of a gun who can communicate with words to all other lesser types who know sign language. Somehow, those not knowing how to speak with voice understand 'voice'. They all utter and it's all utter nonsense. Wishful thinking and humans grappling for some delusional empathy bounces all through the film. There's a phony short of the mark 'empathy' which the movie makers try to be getting at. I saw a little film called 'DOG'S PURPOSE' which was so superior to this film while delivering such a more powerful , empathetic and real interpretation of the whole human vs animal trip. The one ape wondering why pictures were so small when looking through the binoculars was an attempt at humor but was just stupid. That , alone , ought to get one to walk out of a theater. To each their own. I think children, little kids could get something from this flick but just a turn off for me at 74.I wonder if i went out on a date with someone and i hated this show and they loved it would we have much in common? I don't know. Sensibilities are so complex and i don't think reactions and sympathies can be easily measured. I don't understand how anyone can really like this junk with the same vigor someone who loves this show can't understand why i think it's monkey junk. So be it. We can find common ground elsewhere get differing things out of different things. This movie didn't do a thing for me no feeling, no humor nothing interesting going on. The only guy i much like is the dude who was shot dead when he said he was going to put the wood down. Some guy wants to surrender and Caesar shoots him dead. Then, Ceaser shoots a suffering deaf mute. Give me a break!","4/10"

"jcmann01","25 January 2013","Warning: This review does contains spoilers, but PLEASE come back after seeing movie and then read it.I saw the Life of Pi, in which the author attempts to make a few deeper points known about ""What the Truth is,"" whether it be something that is easily believable with our minds or something that you just have to take on faith. In the end, the question is left up to the viewer to decide for themselves. In the movie, Pi, tells the writer that he was going to get him to believe in God by the end of the story, but this is left somewhat mysterious when all is said and done in the movie.So, I will attempt to interpret what Pi was wanting to convey in the movie. I believe that intention here was to present 2 different stories about events that took place. The first story was what Pi actually experienced, but was so incredible, it sounded like he had made it up to cover his pain. The second story sounded more believable because it made sense, but much doubt was eventually cast on it. In the end the first story was prevailed as being the truth, which had to be taken by faith.MY Theological Interpretation:Over the centuries the Bible, in which the stories have been passed down from generation to generation were believed so much that this country's education system was based on the Bible during the 17th century. Now a days, with scientific points of view prevailing, much of the Bible is regarded by many as mere folklore stores that were told around fires and unbelievable to the questioning and the scoffers. So some take it upon themselves to create religions that may seem more believable and rationale to the majority. So they write books explaining the Bible to their followers.Many have mocked the story of Moses crossing the Red Sea and being very exaggerated, but now we have archaeological evidence of it's truth and still, many refuse to believe the truth. Like Pi's stories, there can only be one truth that prevails in the end and that is what actually happened and not what made sense to those who listen. It is also interesting to note that Pi's life was preserved over the ocean for 270 days with a fierce Tiger and yet he survived the ordeal, which is a credit to Psalm 91.Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. What this means is that God will not reveal himself to the faithless and those who constantly question His Word. Christians have a responsibility to give their testimony before the world, but like the 2 Japanese guys, the world fails to believe their testimony of the truth, but would prefer to believe in something that makes more sense to their minds.PS It is by no coincidence that the character was named Pi, because their is no finite answer to this equation if you try to reason it out with your mind.","8/10"
"jcslawyer","1 August 2020","From the opening montage until the start of the credits, it's as if you're watching a beautiful painting manifesting from someone's imagination. Cinematography excellent. Use of color, extraordinary. It's a movie you can't take your eyes off of. You'd bring it to pee or poo so you don't have to pause it!The story is rather simple, but of course there's a lot going on under the surface as introduced early in the film. Pi is not your ordinary child. From a young age, he's pondered, questioned, and sought guidance spiritually, but isn't sure precisely where to find them. Instead of picking one, he picks them all as that is how it helps him try to understand things outside of the realm of comprehension.This desire to learn more and more comes to an abrupt stop when he has a moment with his parents' zoo' tiger, Richard Parker. He feels that there is an understanding that can be had between he and the tiger, so he tries to feed by hand only to be stopped by his father. To teach him the lesson that tigers are just tigers, he forces Pi to watch a goat being fed to the tiger.Next sees the family decide to move to Canada. The father gets them passage on a Japanese boat, which includes the animals from their zoo that they intend to sell. During the voyage, Pi gets the unknown urge to go above deck to watch the storm. He asks his bro to accompany him, but he doesn't want to. Next thing you know, the boat is caught in the treacherous storm culminating in it sinking with his family aboard. There's a brief period where there are others attempting to procure a lifeboat for whomever they can, but Pi causes a delay in the process as he wants to locate his family who, likely, are already deceased. Somehow he gets on the lifeboat at the same time as a zebra who jumps onto it causing it to lower with only Pi and the zebra.During the commotion, Pi is trying to stay afloat and locate whomever he can with no success. During the ensuing hours, the tiger appears to join the boat, a hyena is discovered hiding, and an orangutan is seen floating atop some bananas.The hyena, having no sense of anything other than its hunting instincts, kills the zebra and orangutan. The tiger jumps out (even though no one was sure he was on there under the cloth tarp covering half the boat) and kills the hyena.No need to go into detail about the rest of the movie except to point out key things that seem to have people discussing the film's ending. The movie is told by an adult Pi to a man who was sent by Pi's uncle to get a story for a book he is writing. When Pi is rescued, he is asked by Japanese insurance adjusters what happened. Pi recounts the story, but they either don't believe or don't think others will believe. So Pi retells the story substituting himself for the tiger, a sailor for the zebra, a cook who was a jerk for the hyena, and his mom for the orangutan. The rest of the story though appears to remain the same thereafter, but we're not privy to the rest and we're not sure it's important. The man interviewing Pi asks which was real, to which Pi asks which does he want. The man says the one with animals to which Pi gives a cryptic reply. In either story, his family did not survive. Next you see Pi has a family and has offered his story to the man.So the question that leaves people pondering is which version was real. I've determined the story with animals is real. Everything he did on the journey was for the tiger along with himself. I don't see the metaphor as that being himself the whole time since he spent the journey trying to avoid the tiger by building a raft. One big piece of evidence was the story he was writing while on the boat. Yes, it ultimately gets blown away, but a large portion of that time was devoted to actually documenting the trip as what we see based on the animal version. There's nothing yo indicate that his mom survived shortly or other persons survived. He and the tiger never connect until the tiger and he are so close to exhaustion and dehydration that neither can think about the instinct to kill. When they ultimately reach the shore where Pi is rescued the tiger leaves without even acknowledging Pi. This directly connects to his father's lesson that it's just a tiger. That appears literal, not symbolic of himself. Otherwise the lesson by his father seems unnecessary. Pi does not come off as a conniver and we have no reason to believe he told the story to the man only to throw the other story out there. He told the story with people to please those guys so they'd leave him alone. It's worth noting that the article about him does include survival with a tiger. I didn't question whether it was real until the guy asks. I think Pi just told a story that was true, but when presented with the question of which was real, he allowed the man to choose which fits his needs. I think Pi is satisfied that his story was real. His mom did not survive. He was the only human survivor. Although there were things thrown in there to raise doubt about the authenticity (floating bananas, random island of meerkats), the bananas thing could've easily been misinterpreted as it was during a storm and intense time. Who cares. And just because no one's seen the island doesn't mean it doesn't exist. He saw all kinds of cool things that most people don't see. Him and the tiger never go beyond the relationship as established from the start. Nothing preternatural about it.Don't read too much into it. Pi told his story. The only time doubt is cast is when, during his story, he tells his story intentionally different to appease businessmen. He already told the truth, but they wouldn't relent without something so fantastic.Another reason I think the animal story was real. I've read sites that discuss details from the book that were not included in the movie. Apparently the books offers more details on the alternate story. The film skirts it in a minute or so. If we're truly led to question the two, why omit so much detail from the book? To me it was just a story to get rid of the Japanese men. That's why the filmmakers chose to not spend any additional time on that other than to give the man the ability to do what he feels is best for his story.Anyway excellent film.","10/10"

"jdavenpo","19 July 2017","Plot was just missing everything, no character development, you have no backstory or connection with any character but then the movie would drag out every scene as if we were supposed to be at the edge of our seat every second, except I wasn't. The bad character development and over dramatic scene making creates the perfect movie to fall asleep in, you will start feeling bored and exhausted after only 20 minutes and since it is a long movie you will either feel this way the whole movie like I did or you will be lucky enough to watch this pile of garbage on the plane where you can wake up and the movie will be over. The only reason I gave it a score of 2 is because there has to be at least one movie out there that is worse than this one. It started bad, had a bad plot, had no drama, no character development, had horrible attempts at tension, horrible solutions to problems, it all ends exactly as your 8 year old would have predicted, maybe the Producers preschooler wrote the plot. Yes it was that bad. Humans and apes? battle for the planet? I wish, except it wasn't, it was just pathetic.Oh and the worst part is the embarrassingly high reviews for this stinker. Too bad the Internet has become overrun with armies of paid shills, This movie, were it to be honestly rated by people that actually have seen it, would likely be less than 2 because I gave it a two out of pity.","9/10"
"jdkraus","19 December 2012","""Life of Pi"" is unlike any other film about survival that I have ever seen. The film starts with Pi Patel, an adult who is being interviewed by a Canadian writer who wants to write a great book. Told in flashback, Pi reveals his story, starting with his family, his pursuit of studying different religions, and the animals that his father cared for, including a 450-pound Bengal tiger. His family decides to move to Canada to begin a new life. They hitch a ride on a boat that gets caught in a storm. Surviving the sinking, Pi is forced adrift on a 26-foot lifeboat—with an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and the Bengal tiger. While the story seems simple enough, there are many deep, religious and philosophical undertones thrown into the mix that puts the viewer in a position to think and wonder. Part of the beauty of this film, is that it can be interpreted in many ways. What I see as the underlying message or theme maybe different than someone else. It is not only a movie worth seeing, but it is also worth discussing. With a great degree of ambiguousness and thought-provoking undercurrents, ""Life of Pi"" is supported by magical feats of movie-making. It is a stunning film to look at with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects that are near perfection, and an emotionally driven musical score. The cast is mostly made up of unknowns to the American audience, but they work well in their given roles, specifically Suraj Sharma as young Pi—he gives us a character to care for. However, the character I cared for the most though is the Bengal Tiger. It may seem bad to favor a CGI animal over a human actor, but the SFX geniuses of Rhythm & Hues have given us a being to admire and awe. This movie has been a privilege to see in cinema. I am afraid though that it will lose its impact once it is converted to DVD and Blu-Ray, for to truly appreciate its power, ""Life of Pi"" is a movie that must be seen on the big screen.","10/10"
"jebophos","25 August 2013","Life of Pi was simply amazing! It had that epic feel in spanning the young life of the title character beginning as a young boy - and then his adult self. Add to that the drama and sense of adventure and survival as he is stranded at sea with some animals and eventually the tiger, Richard Parker. Throw in some fantasy and exquisite cinematography with the nighttime scenes especially. And the cherry on top? The message of faith but not in a preachy way. I think some have tried to read into the religious aspect maybe too much in reading other reviews. This film IMO was generalizing to suit a purpose. It's pretty easy to figure out. This is one of those movies that sticks with you. I will be buying a copy on DVD for my permanent library. Ang Lee has done it again!","8/10"

"jelenamnr","26 February 2023","The film's entire premise was sadly silly and devoid of any real scientific foundation. The decision to replace Abby Ryder Fortson (who is 14 years old) with Kathryn, who is 26 years old, was a terrible one because Kathryn's acting was pretty bad and Abby was the right age to continue playing the role. This is, by far, my least favorite of the three films. The film also lacked the previously mentioned actors Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and TI (they were hilarious in the previous films). I believe children will enjoy it, but it lacks the appeal of the other films. There are numerous ridiculous fist fights, nonstop action, and stunning CGI visuals. This film was less humorous than its predecessors.","1/10"
"jenkinscammy","7 June 2023","Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD.","6/10"
"jensenjayson","18 January 2024","This is so stupid it will literally have you asking questions out loud as to wtf is happening.A woman kills herself because of scammers. Stathom had some connection to her, but its never explained. He arrives after it happens. The woman's estranged daughter who has no connection to her mum rocks up, on the day her mum kills herself. She's sad for 1 min, then talks to statham about revenge, she is cool with it. Then spends the rest of the movie trying to stop him from avenging her mother. She is the worst FBI agent in any movie. She has a full ear of tattoos. A really bad haircut and is incompetent.The whole movie you will roll your eyes and wonder why characters are saying and doing stuff that makes zero sense.The fbi swat team come in, told to stand down by a random merchant team, they go outside and statham beats them up.....for no reason.It links to the President, who is a woman, and her son is the main bad guy, and she doesn't know. Is this a crack at Joe Biden lol.This is the worst Statham movie I have ever seen. Why would he make this? Don't watch this movie, it is confusingly stupid.","2/10"
"Jeremy_Urquhart","22 June 2023","Even if I'd had a nice quiet crowd the first time I saw this (I really didn't), this still felt like the kind of movie that demanded a second viewing. Distractions aside, there's just a lot to take in the first time around. The basics are well explained, but the extra/additional details come fast and things that aren't specifically part of the core story can pass by so speedily I couldn't catch as much as I wanted to. A second viewing honestly felt like a first viewing for more than half this movie. I caught a couple more jokes, appreciated the unexpected turns in the narrative (that ending included), and just enjoyed the whole thing a great deal more.I still prefer the first Spider-Verse movie by a hair, because it has a little more emotional weight for me, and I think it's paced a touch better. But Across the Spider-Verse is still emotional and well-paced; I think it flies by so quickly that that ending feels shocking on a first viewing, because the film kind of feels like two acts (with an extended prologue and epilogue) rather than three. The structure's interesting and a little odd, but again, it worked better after seeing it once, and being able to piece it all together while seeing it play out again.And it probably goes without saying, but the animation here is just out of this world. That's the one area that is better than the first, and the first already looked amazing. The music's also just as good, possibly even better. I hope Beyond the Spider-Verse will conclude this trilogy amazingly, and it's probably no exaggeration to say it might be my most anticipated movie of 2024, at least for now (and I'm sure others feel the same way).","10/10"
"Jeremy_Urquhart","30 June 2023","With a heavy heart, I think I have to concede that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not good. It's probably even bad, because even the parts that are sort of entertaining ultimately disappoint.Take for example the prologue with a de-aged Harrison Ford. The technology used to do it is impressive, and only looked awkward in a couple of shots for me. It's Indy adventuring during the end of World War II, and it almost captures the adventure/action you'd want. However, it's so dimly lit that barely anything can be seen. It's probably to disguise the de-aging, but it's disappointing. The stuff you can see isn't particularly great, but it fares better than the next couple of big action scenes.These are spaced out over the next 80 to 90 minutes. Said 80 to 90-minute stretch is honestly very boring. Harrison Ford is trying, and John Williams' score is pretty good. I usually like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, but her character didn't work for me. Barely any of the humor landed. The action is incredibly dull and quite often poorly shot. Ford himself isn't in much of the action, which is understandable, but it also begs the question of why they even bothered trying to make an action movie with an 80-year-old man.I swear characters enter a hotel at night, and they come out the front door five minutes later and it's the middle of the day. Why did they bring John Rhys-Davies back without giving him anything to do? Why was Antonio Banderas in this for like, five minutes? Why do they think audiences will care that Banderas and Toby Jones play ""friends"" of Indiana Jones, even if they've never been seen or mentioned before this film? Why does Hollywood keep wasting Mads Mikkelsen?The final half-hour is sort of fun, but it concludes very abruptly and awkwardly. Some people will hate where the movie goes regardless, but I thought it came close to giving the whole thing a pulse. The final scene itself sounds like it should work on paper, but it did nothing for me emotionally. As I walked home, I liked the movie less and less, the more I thought about it.It's so lifeless and uninspired, and even if maybe a third of it is passable, the rest is a combination of boring and baffling. Even if you're a big fan of the series, I wouldn't bother. This is a good deal worse than the other four.","6/10"
"jeroenv","16 December 2023","No, it is not the best Indiana Jones movie. Yes, it is a bit too long. Yes, Ford is no longer in his thirties. No, the action sequences are not as thrilling as the mine-cart chase from Temple. This is all true, but isn't this to be expected?Raiders and Crusade are close to perfect films, and this installment certainly isn't. But when it's good it's very good, and the lesser parts don't go on too long. It makes for a very fun viewing, if you accept that things are never going to be exactly like in those 2 movies. It has some nostalgia, while acknowledging the age of the main protagonist and that things have changed. The story is far-fetched but grounded in reality just enough for you to suspend disbelief. The action is great to watch. It has heart. It's just...fun, a well-made film with some characters from way back in a new adventure. You know, like Temple and (to a certain extent) Crystal Skull. Or like most James Bond-movies.So if you approach it with that mindset, you're in for a fun ride. If you want a second Raiders, don't bother.","6/10"
"JeromeArlettaz","30 July 2018","As I do with all Marvel stuff, I've loaded it onto the tablet I keep in the bathroom. The scenes are perfectly cut for some minutes in there. And it doesn't matter if you don't remember your last visit after a day or two, there's no correlation. Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void. And as soon as you stand up, the whole stuff is flushed out of our memory. Only persists a reminiscence of nauseating miasma.
Mankind seems to enjoy it. Well in that case, I've got a be an alien. I've decided to quit eating any fibre to never have to endure it again.","4/10"

"Jesper2801","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","10/10"
"jessfaith-45971","8 June 2018","While Avengers Infinity War has some cool action and funny lines, its many death scenes of beloved characters including scenes of characters in pure agony can make this movie very challenging. This is emphasized due to the fact that not all characters will come back and that the characters are popular and well known by many. Add to the fact that the story can be unpredictable and a few tonal shifts, such as an emotional scene suddenly cutting to Tony Stark and co. cracking jokes and one- liners, and you got a movie that's overall not worth watching again.","3/10"
"jeyaj078","29 June 2020","This film is as epic Lion King and draws some aspects from Logan.This film deserves to be part of the 8 or 9/10 category. It is truly a powerful movie full of emotion and suspense. It gives us a glimpse into the past of human actions and as well as a glimpse to what our future could become.The story telling is as captivating as the revolutionary visual effects. The acting portrayed here is one of the most complexed and original portrayals I have ever seen. Acting like apes that are human-like whilst showing animalistic emotions.This movie is genuinely what movie series conclusion stories should be like.","4/10"
"Jf12345","26 June 2023","As a fan of Spiderman, I really enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse because it has the best plot supported by amazing visual effects which make this movie a godsend, a masterpiece. While watching this movie, I don't even realise it is a 2 hours 16 mins movie.Good:
Firstly, extraordinary animation. It not just kept the animation style of Into the spider verse, but it also expanded what they did in the first film. They boldly adopted a variety of different visual effects of the scenes. It uses six different animation styles to portray and create new universes whereas Into the Spider-Verse only used one. I can truly say that its animation sublimates the plot of the storyline in this movie. It is worth waiting for 5 years to watch this movie!!!!! Every scene every second is extraordinary. And this movie is not skimping on providing high quality animation with charming animation styles, also putting massive easter eggs for the audiences to dig for them.Secondly, the casts perfectly adopted characters. Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld give their best performance to make their own characters more attractive and trigger my emotions to care about these characters. In my opinion, I am very obsessed with the character of Miguel O'Hara. Oscar Isaac brings an amazing performance to show Miguel O'Hara's helplessness, determination to stop Miles and insistence on doing what he thinks is right. I don't even think that he is the villain, he is just a person who doesn't want Miles to go through what he experienced before.Thirdly, the sensational plot. The movie smartly chooses to build up the background of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy instead of just putting action scenes in the first act. It is efficient step by step to build up the characteristics of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy to let the audiences know what they care for. The audiences will keep on immersing in this film while watching.Bad
If I must say the bad of this movie, I would say that the story is not completed in part 1. Some movies separated the story plot into 2 parts to let the characters gather their strength for a final confrontation in the sequel such as ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Infinite War"". For these movies, they are great because the characters have completed something and the rest of the story will be resolved in the sequel. For example, the Rebel Alliance flees from the Empire in ""Empire Strikes Back"" and Thanos successfully cuts down half of the population in the universe after he snaps his finger in ""Infinity War"". However, ""Across the spider verse"" seems like the first and second act of the story. The movie doesn't not give any answer to resolve the story and the story questions still exist until the end of this film.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you watch this movie as much as you would. And you should watch the movie with the bigger screen. Remarkable animation, amazing story plot and sensational characters build the masterpiece and it deserves you to spend the time to watch it again and again.","9/10"
"jfrancosa","21 February 2023","I love Marvel movies, but there's something about this one that made me feel that I was watching Spy Kids film. Some bad CGI for Marvel. What's up with that?🚨Spoiler alert 🚨M. O. D. O. K's CGI is the saddest of them all. A big headed monstrosity that looks like Pac Man. Also, his back story, I don't know, I don't like when writers change a character's back story.Overall, the movie is fun to watch, and if you like the MCU you will enjoy it. Probably not the best MCU Movie, but there are worse. Paul Rudd makes all the Antman movies worth it. Same here. He's a funny guy.Now, the movie plot could've been better.","7/10"
"JGar40","19 January 2019","Everything about it is great. Andy Serkis, good plot, the cinematography. I don't understand all the low scores, people must have small attention spans. The first one was good and the 2nd one was really good but this movie sets a new standard for any future ape films.","5/10"
"JGar40","21 July 2017","In truthfulness, I was going to give it a 9 but after seeing so many repulsive reviews I'm giving it a 10. The cinematography and the CGI is the best in the film industry and it's just unbelievable. This is not a war film contrary to the title which is part of why people are leaving bad reviews. This is a sci-fi film that also explores what people are willing to do to survive and it explores the dark side of human nature. I feel a lot of people came in expecting some epic CGI futuristic ape v human because they never watched the first 2 films. Caesar played by Andy Serkis has his strongest performance yet and ends this trilogy very well. New character Bad Ape is not necessary but provides a little comic relief in an otherwise dark film. In a throwback to the source material and older films we have Nova, a little girl who is important to the plot. Overall this a great film and a good end to this ape trilogy and I do hope we have more Planet of the Apes films like this in the future. I think most of the people who are reviewing really don't understand cinema and are partially hating it because it's not a War film. If you haven't seen the first two films and will be bored because it's not the way it's advertised don't watch. But I recommend this as it is a masterpiece. Also I saw some reviews calling out racial or sexist undertones which is completely false","1/10"
"jgeorge4","16 July 2017","Clearly, when a movie is this terrible, yet gets such stellar reviews from IMDb users and metacritics alike, something fishy is going on. Actually, something apey is going on. I suspect we are all victims of a gorilla marketing campaign.Ha ha. Get it? A guerilla marketing...meh, never mind. The important thing is yes, this movie really is that bad. By now we are all used to the fake reviews on IMDb that accompany any movie on its opening weekend. But what is up with these inflated metacritic scores?I LOVED the first installment in this franchise. I loved the screenplay, the acting, and the gritty realism. But this? Total childish schlock. If I had to choose one and only one adjective, it would be maudlin.I would have walked out of this movie if I didn't bring four kids with me. Within the first ten minutes, the magnitude of your error in wasting your money will become apparent. This movie is BAD. Avoid!","10/10"
"jhalcollege","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work. At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","1/10"
"jharbert-47785","19 February 2023","A lot of sci-fi these days worries about being grounded more in known science. Concerned with being picked apart by the internet and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I really enjoyed that Quatumania does more of that old school 70s style weirdness while still having things that hint at the science that inspired it. There are crazy creatures, landscapes and communities all over the place. It put me in the mind of something like 'Flash Gordon'(1980) and that's exactly what I've been hoping for from an Ant-man film.It's not Oscar bait, but it's fun with a cool world that they play in. The cast is entertaining and Johnathan Majors especially, is fantastic as Kang. The film does start to tie all the strings Marvel has been placing together. Which gives what is a popcorn flick a bit more weight.All in all, for me it was what I expected and hoped for.Note: there are two end credits scenes.","5/10"

"jimmystz","8 June 2023","Its not bad, it just doesn't fill the shoes.The movie is caught up in doing a bad impression of the original but misses the small details and cleverness that made the original a hit.So much of the plot and dialog is flat. The surprises didn't surprise me. I barely noticed them. The jokes where uninspired. I think I laughed once. The stakes where much higher but the tension felt much lower.Its worse in the technical aspects as well. Sound design, Pacing, Art Direction, Character Depth and Development all worse. Technically Across the Spider-Verse has a deeper world but not much of it was not memorable. I felt like the movie took a long time to say and show very little where the original did the complete opposite.When the squeal was announced and I heard they had different directors I raised an eyebrow. I lightly considered that team to be miracle workers. Unfortunately the concerns seem proven. The current Directing team says they're done after the second act of Across the Spider-Verse.I know a colossal amount of time, energy and love went into this movie and I'm scorching it. Squeals are notoriously hard to balance. They are often caught between what the original was and what so many people imagine that it should have/ could have been. Squeals sometimes they get tangled trying to be an unnecessary correction.Despite all these criticisms its still a good movie. There was a lot to appreciate. It was fun and characters will make you feel something. The best parts of the movie where all around the Parents of the many Spider-Verses. They tried to make the importance of family the core but that is difficult in an action movie were the hero's are living split secrete lives. Holding out hope for the next one.","1/10"
"jinx_malone","30 June 2023","Then I wouldn't have bothered to see the picture, now would I? I'm paraphrasing, of course, but this has become such a tired refrain in movies these days. I wonder if it'll ever stop? This time out they get the always lovely Mads Mikkelsen to do the honors, but even his (evil!) charm can't prevent the annoyance I feel that I'm being lectured to, yet again.In order to review this movie, I have to talk about the day I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark with my dad. I was ten. It was my absolute favorite movie as a little girl. I liked Star Wars okay, but...My dad had read articles in the paper about Raiders, and heard the radio ads and couldn't wait for it to come out. He was super excited that he was going to see a modern day take on the serials he had loved so much when he was a little boy. It was especially cool for me; my family were all huge movie lovers, but this was the first time me and my dad would ever see a movie by ourselves. Mom liked mysteries and romances, dad liked sci-fi and adventure, and I loved classics and horror. Our household covered all the genre bases nicely! This time out though, she just wasn't interested. So we waved goodbye, and off we went. Me and dad got our tickets, waited patiently in line at the concession stand and splurged on jujubes and twizzlers and sno-caps and giant sodas and our own tubs of popcorn. Staggering under the weight of candy and enough extra 'butter' to feed twenty people, we got our favorite seats-dead center and in the last row of the first section-and settled in. I never had a better time at the movies. Sitting there with my dad, I could see right away why he had loved these movies when he was a boy. You couldn't help but love them. It was like being on a roller coaster, so many twists and turns, seeing far-flung corners of the world, tombs and treasures and romance and adventure and SNAKES, great music, wonderful good guys to cheer for and the most evil villains to hiss at. Marion was tough and beautiful and I wanted to be her, running that bar in the snowy wilds of Nepal and drinking all the men under the table with a gleam in her eye; Indiana himself the perfect hero, smart and funny and brave and handsome-he was my first crush-and it was the most fun I ever had at the movies. It's because it *was* a terrific movie, but also because every time I peeked over at my dad, he had a truly wonderful look of sheer happiness on his face-so much like a little kid again himself, he was so caught up in the movie. When it was done, we left the theater, shouting and laughing about all the coolest parts (just shoot him!) and the grossest parts (melting Nazis!) and talked about it all the way home, we just couldn't stop going over it. Of course, mom wanted to see it right away! It was the perfect movie to see with my dad, and an experience I'll always look back on with happiness, especially now that he's not with us anymore.I'm sure most of you already know what this picture's about, so I'll keep this brutally short and say that I'm so glad the rumors weren't true, (or so glad they reshot the ending) and I'm also glad I got in for free. Nothing will ever change the fact that in my world, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. Lives happily ever after in a dizzying rush of treasure and romance and adventure, always young and strong, always a hero.Thanks for taking me to the movies, Dad. I miss you.","2/10"
"jippy33","12 October 2017","First of all, this movie is a victim of audience expectations and bad marketing. You would think this was the ape vs human version of Saving Private Ryan when looking at the trailers. It is not. It is a 140-minute drama about family, grief, survival and war. It is a bold move for a franchise that has been all CGI and action.Sure, there is hardly a scene without CGI (since there is hardly a scene without an ape) and the movie is bookended by great action set pieces. But the roughly hour-and-a-half in the middle is a journey, both literally and metaphorically. The emotional depth that is displayed by the primary characters with very little dialogue is astounding and very rare in this genre. I was shattered after this movie was done, so invested in the characters, so overjoyed by their victories and grief-stricken by their hardships. And the amazing cinematography only strengthens the depth of every scene. Throw in quite a bit of humor as well and you have a drama for the ages.Special mention has to be given Amiah Miller. She has not a single line of dialogue, yet struck every chord of the emotional spectrum as the sole human amongst all the apes. The journey of a child, left alone only to find a new home in the most unlikely place of all is an amazing tearjerker when acted and shot this well.There are some tropes here and there that made me roll my eyes a bit. You have the odd ex-machina and what not. It still does not stop me from dishing out my first IMDb 10 in 2017.","8/10"
"jius","2 June 2023","Don't write many reviews, but this film deserves every bit of it's 10/10 score. The film pulls you in with the crispiest animation images I've seen on the big screen - you seriously cannot watch this on a home TV screen to give it justice. Beautiful colours and sequences it leaves you in awe. The score and soundtrack is amazing and is like the glue that binds the images together and feels very much part of the feel and story - not just some random celeb hits added as an afterthought.The excellent script with its qwerks, twists, jokes and heart felt moments just capture you attention non-stop, that you don't have time to even contemplate how time has passed in the real world. I've watch Disney and other animation stuff checking watch or phone waiting for the end, but not one bit in this movie. It truly captures your attention from beginning to end.The cast are very well put together with each voice and actor just giving fantastically to the story in their unique ways.I went to watch on a non-cheap night at the cinema with the whole family and it's the first film in a long long time that I didn't feel a bit robbed and actually came out so glad my little monetary contribution has gone into the film for cast and crew. They have done a fantastic job. It is by far the best Spiderman film in all areas.It seriously is a must watch!","10/10"
"jj_spicer","18 February 2013","I went into Life of Pi not knowing anything about it. I'd seen trailers, and assumed it was a ""Jungle Book on Water"" sort of story. The trailers don't really do it justice as far as conveying what sort of story it is. It's a truly memorable film.A young boy, Pi, on his way to Canada with his family and their animals from their zoo, is shipwrecked and left stranded in the middle of the ocean on a boat with nothing but a Bengal Tiger to keep him company. But, unlike the Jungle Book, where you'd imagine the boy and the tiger become best friends and head off on an exciting adventure together, this story remains anchored in realism. This tiger is an actual tiger, which tends to want to maul and eat animals, including our protagonist, and there is a very effective scene early on that establishes this premise.The story becomes a tale of how the two manage to survive in close proximity with each other, each knowing the other wants to survive, and each knowing that, somehow, survival is dependent on the other. And as the final scenes start to show, the metaphor behind the scenario is deep and thought-provoking. Questions of religion, faith, humanity and the soul are raised, and you'll leave the cinema having experienced a pretty thought-provoking film.Suraj Sharma has to carry the film, as he and his CGI (for the most part) tiger are the only two characters on screen for most of the 2+ hours, echoing shades of Cast Away. And Sharma does a terrific job for a young and relatively unheard of actor. Ang Lee certainly brings out the best in his performance, and the effects on the tiger are sensational. You know he must be a CGI creation, simply for safety and practicality reasons, but you truly can't tell at times whether its one of the few scenes that has an actual tiger in it. It goes to show how far CGI has come.It's a visually stunning film, and its cinematography certainly adds to the story, rather than just provide a platform. Lee has always been good at using the surroundings to bring a story to life, and whilst sometimes, it maybe feels a little too pushed (the whale scene, whilst stunning, seems a little over the top), it's still wonderfully done. I didn't even find the 3D effects distracting.I would be surprised if this won any Oscars, simply cause it's maybe not the sort of film that would lead to any sort of wins, except maybe in the visual effects field, but its still certainly a terrific movie to take in. I suspect reading the book may give further meaning to the film's themes, but there are plenty there already to deal with.","10/10"
"jjakum-96413","6 June 2023","Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie but people are acting like this is Godfather 2. It's rated higher than The Dark Knight lol . I'd probably put it 7th on the list of Spider-Man movies.The positive:Gwen was probably the best part of the movie. They did a great job with her and she is probably as much the lead in this movie as Miles. Her action scenes were great and her character was likable.Miles character was also very well done and it was nice to see his character progress and mature from the last one. I'm a Peter Parker guy but there is definitely room for Miles.I thought the Spot, who is usually a lame villain, was pretty cool. I liked the character arc and progression they gave him.Miguel was a decent character. I'm hoping there is more character development in Pt 2 because he just comes off like an angry jerk the entire movie.The action scenes were well done and all the cameos were a lot of fun and the final twist at the end was fantasticThe negative:It was about 45 minutes too long. I miss the sub 2 hr movie. My youngest was bored to tears before the midway point.They totally neutered Peter B Parker, who was the best part of the first movie. They made him a complete buffoon.The animation was a bit much at times. It was headache inducing.Hobart was cool when you could understand what he was saying. It was like listening to a Gallagher brother voicing a Spider-Man character..I hated every scene that Spider-Woman was in.

It doesn't make sense and Michael Douglas was just there to fly a ship and have an army of ants attack kang. It's Michael Douglas they could of something more with him. And modok, just no,no and no he wasn't really a good villain and the cg, ugh. The post credit scenes added nothing to the mcu, it was just advertisements for avengers 5 and loki, nothing was connected to the mcu. They need to find a different director for ant-man 4.","7/10"
"jlcanislupus","27 April 2019","Oh boy, let´s go, then: Avengers: Endgame was one of the movie I was REALLY anxious to see. After IW, the bar was really high. So, I though the bar would be as high or even higher. Unfortunately I was wrong. I´ll make my opinion this way:POSITIVES:Acting was superb, in general, but RDJ's was top.CGISoundtrackNEGATIVES:First one and simply put...this is not an action movie, it´s a drama with some scenes of action. When you go to an action movie you don´t hear many people crying during the movie, do you?Pace too slow. The first 2 hours are quite boring. Then you get some 20 minutes of good action;So, the villain that was unbeatable in the first movie is killed in the first minutes of the movie? Right...Time travel usually gives some headaches after. That are several in this movie, like future Nebula killing the past Nebula and still, being able to exist all the same;The way they treated Hulk again was a joke. In the last movie it was offensive. In this, you have a nice smart Hulk, that barely fights;The way they treated Thor. Now his beard is massive, he doesn´t take bath and mostly, he´s a fat drunk;Too much time was spent on Haweye. Who cares about him?Remember how hard was to beat Thanos with IG? Forget it, know Thor, Cap (with Thor´s Mjolnir) and Iron Man can´t beat him, even with Thanos not having the IG. In fact, not even the OP Captain Marvel can do it. The only one was SW;Captain Marvel, every time she appears, shows how much powerful she is. But, forget it, she´s out about 97% of the movie;The gathering of the team was forced and lame;Quill has little time. Just some few minutes;Dr. Strange and SW have even less time;Cap. and Stark interaction was short, as usual;Pepper now is kind of a Iron Woman. She appears in the final battle...! What???;Hulk could handle the IG, but they had to put Iron Man due it in order to kill him. Sorry, that´s too much for me.Such a massive of opportunity they had here. They could even given us a better movie than IW...","6/10"
"jljacobi","3 July 2023","Take the soul, ruin the hero, add a girl boss. Disney has never done it better.The first part of the move, oddly enough feels somewhat like a real Indiana Jones movie. Fade to black.Now Indy is a sad, pathetic shell of himself wallowing in alcohol and self-pity. Just what I wanted to see.This movie is almost vindictive in tone, trying to bury the past for a future of Phoebe Waller Bridge--one of the most unlikeable characters ever to hit the screen.Indeed, the only thing that passes for a character arc is that she's not as big an ass at the end as she is in the beginning.How on earth could anyone enjoy this who saw the first three? I'm sorry I wasted my time and there's no way to unsee it. I desperately wish there were.","4/10"
"jmbwithcats","16 July 2014","OK so I just finished watching, and thought it was a profoundly beautiful movie that captures the way myths are created, and the truths they hide, and beautiful... so did the tiger exist? I think ultimately no, there was no tiger, no orangutans, no hyena, and no zebra, like he says there's the mundane story, the forms... of the sailor, the cook, his mother and himself... but that only tells the physical and emotional story... the spiritual story is told by the boy, the tiger, the orangutans, the hyena and the zebra.... one feels the profound love and loss as they are in the heart, and not just in the distant mediocrity of detached relationships... this elevates the film to great heights and depths... and I could not say I found it wanting in any way... How do you explain any love or loss? You can't just say it in words, you have to paint a picture... and that's what the boy and the tiger represented, an ability to be inspired and not destroyed by simple human pettiness.","9/10"
"jmcternan-91574","28 July 2017","Oh I tried to ignore the propaganda, I really did, the first two films of this trilogy are very good films (and not in a back handed ""for a summer blockbuster"" sort of compliment), but this is an awful 150 million misstep. This is my 2nd review ever and I don't review things unless they particularly rub me the wrong way.I'll be spelling certain words wrong to get around word gagging orders on IMDb.War of the Planet of the Apes literally beats you over the head with this defecation of the human spirit, I'm in awe of how blatantly forward it is and I love good sci-fi commentary. (Battlestar Galactica and The Wire are some of my favorite pieces of fiction)Here in this script we have no sympathy for Harrelson's and humanity's understandable dilemma as to how to beat a virus that is causing humans to lose their speech and higher faculties. They don't even have the balls to have the apes wipe out what's left of the human army as that would make the apes even more obviously terrible than they already are; so they have a natural disaster do the job. The blond girl/child that they carry with them goes to live with the apes, dumb(from the virus) but happy.......and humanity's downfall is complete. Even though exalt the child's beauty early in the film! But what is beauty without brains ultimately?What great moral lesson was I supposed to glean? That humans are so terrible that we should walk quietly into the night? Oh look the apes are thick.....but some of them are funny Totally worth it!Conversations and plot points are so monosyllabic that it was almost orgasmic when Woody Harrelson turned up to speak more than than the few grunts that we hear up to this point and FINALLY gives us a reason to care.Bonus points for cultural maxisms (spelled wrong to get around censorship) is when the blond child cries over the ape who is killed that she has known for all of two scenes but doesn't even flinch when her father is killed by said group of apes.Go out to the beach with your kids, hell even go the beach or lake by yourself, hell go further, go out when its raining and make some memories.Also I'm not the slightest bit Christian and I can see this picture is blatantly not only anti-Christian but to the non religious out there as well its this......anti human, anti intelligence","8/10"
"jmichael3387","4 May 2018","I wasn't expecting much going in. I figured it would be all action, since there are so many characters. But I at least thought some of the action would be entertaining. But it wasn't. Not one action scene was any good. Thor Ragnarok was a masterpiece compared to this. This movie was truly dreadful. My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while. The 9.0/10 rating here is Fake News, I guarantee you that. Statistically impossible....especially for such a bad movie. I was sooo bored.","3/10"
"jmw111085","3 February 2024","This is another action film featuring Statham. He plays the same character he's played in just every movie he's starred in. That's good and that's what we expect to see. It's fun to hear his one-liners and watch him whip the bad guys.However, the action scenes are a major disappointment. Instead of him whipping three or four guys in a fight now he's beating ten guys up at a time. Worse yet, most of these guys are special forces types with extensive training yet they stand around like the kung fu gangs who stand mostly still waving their arms while the hero downs each gang member one at a time. Additionally, like the bad guys in Rambo movies they can't shoot straight.All in all the action scenes are very lame and forgettable.I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they're a hard core Statham fan.","7/10"

Don't really know what else to say to fill out six hundred words to be honest. From almost the start this film made me cringe, I couldn't even enjoy the CGI and other effects which I admit were impressive but would have served better in a completely different movie as my attention could not be held, the whole affair was difficult to watch.A huge disappointment & criminal waste of money!!","6/10"

"JohnDeSando","14 January 2024","""If a beekeeper says you're gonna die, you're gonna die."" Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons)When patrician bad boy, Oscar-winning Irons intones this threat/reality, you can figure The Beekeeper, Jason Statham's newest blood fest, may be a cut above his usual tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. It is, lusty as his revenge motif is and metaphoric as the title wants to be.Retired federal operative, read ""assassin,"" called a ""Beekeeper,"" Adam Clay (Statham),--hear the metaphor start ringing-- witnesses the exploitation of an elderly friend, Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), by ruthless internet scammers, ending in her suicide. Director David Ayer and writer Kurt Wimmer not quite subtly weave the analogy of Clay ridding the hive (read society) of bad bees, even ones at the very top of the hive's government.I know, The beekeeper is just another example of revenge porn, but they have crafted an early try at literacy while keeping us fed on the nectar of ramming order into a chaotic political world such as our current presidential race fosters. While the script may offer too many ham-handed allusions to the figurative underpinnings, I found myself pleased by the attempt and remembering how the Bard eloquently incorporated the motif into one of his bloodiest and most romantic battle plays when he speaks of""the honeybees, / Creatures that by a rule in nature teach / The act of order to a peopled kingdom."" The Archbishop of Canterbury in Shakespeare's Henry V.Statham, 56 and feisty as ever, is as stone faced as ever, but the surprisingly effective setup with the death of his friend at the beginning casts a serious and almost literate overlay to otherwise transparently fabulous death actions that would otherwise be plain silly. Avenging the scammed elderly seems noble given how many of us have seen the sudden blinking warning that our system has been compromised and don't do anything but ""Call this number!"" If you're old and electronic averse, you're ready to be scammed.Stepping outside the usually-absurd carnage, The Beekeeper touches on such important societal blights as corrupt political campaign funding and malicious interference of family members with otherwise benign politicians. Although bad boys are as bad, if not worse, than any you have seen in these oft-cliched thrillers, this film tries to be more original, topical, and literate with both the good and the bad.Not bad for a Statham cliche.","6/10"
"JohnDeSando","21 November 2012","''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat."" From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger ""Richard Parker"" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,"" says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat.","9/10"
"JohnJohnRomualdez","11 August 2023","It's a pity that a few intelligent people ruined the last Indi movie so much. Is no one really paying attention? George Lucas, where have you been? Don't you have anything to say anymore? Obviously not.Spoiler allert:
Worst of all is the Helena character. The woman is just batshit crazy. Has no manners. Treats her Godfather (Indiana) like the last idiot. Then: nobody believes that the woman travels to N. Y. and steals half the disc only to sell it again in Morocco (?) For gambing debts??? What was that about? From then on, the woman is a nightmare in every scene she is in. Her character is just a horrible woman. Zero humor. In every other the movie all the other women were top of their game. Not here.Then this totally superfluous Teddy. Horrible the child, which is simply supposed to be a copy of short round. Why did he actually steal from another young person at the market? Why was there this scene? Completely stupid are the 100 km / h fast TukTuks? Stupid. Why Antonio Banderas played the captain in the first place? He probably just wanted to be there. Anyway.The movie is just boring and again - what were the stupid writers thinking to make Indian Jones look so weak? Harrison, okay at your age and for that much money, then you can do something like that. Nobody wants to see Indiana like in this movie. Maybe someone will just fire Kathleen Kennedy, she is the main person responsible for this stupid, stupid movie.Serves Disney right for losing hundreds of millions of dollars.Worst writing ever!!!!!!!!!","6/10"

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a hyperactive techno-dream of super-heroic proportions, and it's the (presumably) penultimate chapter of The Spider-Verse Saga. And what a Saga it is so far!Spider-Man's easily one of cinema's most iconic superheroes and he's had to endure some REAL triumphs and headaches along the way (for every Spider-Man 2, there's an Amazing Spider-Man 2). And Across The Spider-Verse is another defining chapter in Spider-Man's storied legacy on the big screen.This one's gonna have some strong praise for it, and there's gonna be detractors saying it's not as well-rounded as the first (both situations are understandable), but what the film does right it does it in proud strides. It's like an arthouse Spider-Man film that knows fan-service has its own depths of character and history, and the lines between animation and live-action are virtually non-existent in the Spider-Verse.For such a tried-and-true character like Spider-Man, it's pretty damn surprising and refreshing the Spider-Verse films are as solid as they are. Sure some of the world building may have SOME plot-holes regarding the machinations of multiverse logic, but its playbook is easily the most creative one in cinema today. And by far the nuttiest too.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is running laps around its competition right now, and it's one of those rare examples where a sequel deserves every ounce of praise it gets. Toy Story had that same magic (up to Toy Story 3); now Spider-Man's Spider-Verse is taking its crown.Rock-solid story, chaotic visuals and deep characters that are bigger than one universe alone. 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.","10/10"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1 June 2023","The MCU's struggling to find new focus on anything post Avengers: Endgame, and this film is probably THE ideal blueprint for how other filmmakers can tackle the all-encompassing wackiness of multiverses, especially with a character as beloved and established as Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse was originally a Part I, but then Part II became Beyond The Spider-Verse (which is due next year), and it's clear these films are becoming the Toy Story equivalent for animated superhero cinema. The characterisations are air-tight, the screenplay knows the difference between metaphysical craziness and intimate character arcs, and the animation goes above and beyond in terms of remixing itself with SOOOO many different styles and vibes.First and foremost, the primary story focuses on Miles and Gwen, and how the Spider-Verse is making their lives all the more crazy and larger than they ever dreamed of. And it's also about making peace with their vigilante careers, and accepting that they're part of something bigger than Spider-Man alone. And nothing's getting in the way of compromising who they are deep down: compassionate heroes who'd risk themselves for the greater good.A sequel that's bolder and bigger than its already great precursor, Into The Spider-Verse, that this film leaves you wanting more in the BEST way possible. And this cliffhanger: it's a doozy. It brings the film's arcs to a close yet leaves them open enough that they'll lend themselves to Beyond The Spider-Verse (hopefully) rather nicely.Across The Spider-Verse is even crazier than Into The Spider-Verse, and it manages to complement the film rather than 'overtake' it in terms of relevance. Here's hoping Beyond The Spider-Verse delivers what it promises us.I give Across the Spider-Verse 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.P. S. This film's craziness... needs to be SEEN to be believed! Hell, this might be THE proverbial metaphysical film of 2023.","10/10"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","12 September 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a mouthful of a title, and the film itself provides satisfactory beats that the last two films were leading up to. We're closer to the world seen in the original Planet of the Apes, though this one presumably takes place in a totally different timeline and universe to the classic Charlton Heston film from 1968. And there's a very odd thing happening here with these reboot movies: every sequel in THIS series is better than the previous sequels. 'War' is a great sequel to 'Rise' and 'Dawn' respectively; and the sequels to 'Rise' have been much stronger than the sequels to the original Planet of the Apes film. At least I think these sequels are stronger than the past ones.Andy Serkis is great here, Woody Harrelson is great too (a bit of a Hitler and Trump thing going on with his character I think), and this film is memorable conclusion to a trilogy of films we didn't know we wanted to have. There's sure to be more films down the track from 'Apes', but damn 'War' is a good film in itself.See this one once it's out on DVD and BluRay, or Digital Video.","9/10"

The Russo Brothers deliver the screenplay of a lifetime from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; and boy the two duos that have single-handedly shaped the MCU into what it is today. They direct a star-studded cast featuring the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Peter Dinklage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo. That's only PART of the ensemble cast this film has to offer. And the story; my god the story and scale of this movie: IT'S INCREDIBLE; and it's basically a full-fledged space opera now!For those of you who aren't ardent superhero nuts but passively love Spider-Man all the same (like I do), get this: SPIDER-MAN IS IN SPACE!

"johnnyhbtvs27","17 February 2023","Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is the first movie of Phase 5 for Marvel yet never really gets off the ground. It continues Marvel's recent trend of producing bloated CGI messes.There is nothing wrong with Ant-Man 3 yet it is so spectacularly average you can't help but wonder what could have been with the Quantum Realm with a better script and more time.It has all the usual Marvel beats with comedic nods to other Avengers, characters there to be the wise cracking humour of the piece eg. Veb, M. O. D. O. K. They provide some funny moments but once the usual last 30 minutes of huge CGI battles occurs, interest wanes.The real star of Ant-Man 3 is Kang The Conqueror. Kang is who we are all here to see and he doesn't disappoint. Jonathan Majors is fantastic in the role and i can't wait to see him out in the open and tackling the other Avengers.There are some nice cameos from Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson & especially Bill Murray, who is great as Lord Krylar with his screen time limited. Kathryn Newton does well taking over as Cassie Lang and makes me think a Young Avengers could work.Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania is on the lower tier of Marvel movies but with it's inclusion it sets up Phase 5 nicely and I'm intrigued to see what's to come.","8/10"

It is overly reliant on CGI and expects nostalgia to see it through.James Mangold is a competent director but he's no Spielberg. It's almost like he's read a guide to making an Indiana Jones movie and missed the mark. There is no heart to the movie which is the Spielberg spark it's missing.The CGI is horrific with the worst saved for Harrison Ford's face. The movie is like 90% CGI and may as well have been like animation at times. Past characters are written out in abhorrent fashion and threw away without a care.The last 30 minutes.

"johnofardeal","19 February 2019","I enjoyed this a lot! The thing that I liked the most was the choreography of the fight scenes. Amazing! I really felt like being there with them the whole time. The animation is gorgeous most of the time, except some moments when the CGI looks a bit blocky, videogame-ish, but it moves fast so you won't notice it very often.Another strong point was how they managed to rewrite Broly's story and fit it in the greater Dragonball universe. I think they did a good job at explaining most of the changes added to the characters. A lot of great cameos. The new characters were also enjoyable and the creatures from Broly's planet were really interesting, especially his giat pet.Satisfying climax. Of course, Gocku and Vegeta fighting together is always a pleasure to witness and the fan service is strong with this one. Also, Broly's transformation is just violent.I didn't like some of the design changes for the main cast. Sometimes it felt a bit weird watching someone's who's supposed to be Vegeta not being very Vegeta-like. But it's ok. The animation is more fluent and so they probably had to adapt. Also, it felt like there were no real stakes. I mean, after seeing Goku use UI in the series it's hard to bring some guy and make him instantly more powerful, but again, that's just how Dragonball is.Great movie! Thank you to all involved in making it!","10/10"
"johnplocar","3 January 2018","I'm a pretty big fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films. I love the first one, my favorite is ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", and the recent reboot series comes along and I've been trying to love them as much as everyone else does, but I can't seem to bring myself there. I liked ""Rise"" just fine. It has a decent character driven story with a likable main cast, but suffers from pretty poor looking special effects and blatantly abuses CGI; while also having some pretty standout bad moments shoved in at inappropriate times. Overall a fine film. Then ""Dawn"" comes along and it improves in some aspects, but takes some major missteps in others. It is a fantastically made film, the character of Caesar and most of the apes are phenomenally well done, the effects were great and the story was very solid. Problems mainly resided 100% in all of the human characters whether they were hollow 2-dimensional shells with no personality nor charisma whatsoever or they were complete idiots only there to further the plot with their stupidity which was annoying and not believable in the slightest. Again, overall a fine film. Now ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" comes in and holy moly this is a great movie. Legitimately a great film. It is everything I have wanted out of this reboot series and more. It's dark, one of the bleakest films to come out of 2017 for sure but also has plenty of levity to it as well. It has humanity and personality and style throughout its entirety. All of the characters are interesting and 3-dimensional beings. The villain, played by Woody Harrelson, is terrifying and Andy Serkis as Ceasar is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest heroes ever portrayed on the big screen. Ceasar's character arc is one of best I've seen in a movie series and it comes to a true glorious end here.The cinematography is gorgeous with its feel of an old school epic, the story is enthralling and beautifully poetic, tonally pitch perfect, and the action as well as every plot point feels monumental. Easily one of the best films of the year.","8/10"
"JohnRayPeterson","23 February 2013","This movies is simply enchanting and a visual spectacle to behold; it's not surprising to me that it made it to the Oscars. What is surprising, is that it made it from book to film; I could not have imagined this could be done and give the story justice. How can you bring such a wonder of imagination and well written prose to the screen? Well, Ang Lee did; his work, what I've seen of it in the past, certainly lets one to believe that he has no fear and is blessed with every author's dream, a total appreciation of their work. It was a friend, and fellow author, who lent me 'L'histoire de Pi' by Yann Martel. Nothing unusual with a local author introducing to another, the work of yet another one, except that I was not into fantasy novels. My mind has been open to it, in no small part by Martel's third literary endeavour; I can now enjoy, and boy do I, such work as Mark Lawrence's The Broken Empire, for the beauty of the style( I hope to god someone put that on film).Anyway, the life story, the fantastic part it certainly, of Piscine Molitor Patel is one that begged to be put on paper and thanks to Ang Lee also on screen. The special effects are well done and will garnish some oohs and ahs to be sure. A film the whole family can enjoy, but caution to those looking for a merry fable; it is a harsh depiction of life. I do not wish to spoil anyone's pleasure by revealing more and will simply say Go see that movie.","9/10"

"jojorvt","4 July 2023","Wow just wow! This movie better win many awards. It's clever, has a good story not to mention the most unique cinematic story ever made! Everyone should see this weather you like the Spider-Man franchise and with or without kids. Run don't walk. Prepare to have your mind blown! The script is funny, serious and soooo clever! The emotion in this ""cartoon"" (which I feel like it may be offensive to call it that) is superb! My husband and I kept looking at each other in the movie over the kids like whoa! Wow! That's so cool! How did even think about this! Also to add the soundtrack is perfect as well! An all around amazing movie!","10/10"
"jojunno","20 February 2023","Marvel really has fallen and it can't get up. This is the third legacy character that they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man they not only wasted great established characters but superb casts. Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any movie in recent history. MODOK use and ""dick"" turn could be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the movie as if they ran out of budget. What an absolute waste.","6/10"
"JokerSmokers","27 January 2019","This movie preludes the events that occurred up till present day where Vegeta and Goku arent willing to be complacent in their strength would like to further themselves. This movie sees Freeza make a come back but as usual his power hungry ways blinds him from the bigger picture. His tunnel vision only unleashes a wrath that will be the demise of every living being and places risk on himself as well as planet earth. This movie focuses on the many phases and strengths the Saiyans themselves enjoy and how they develop their strategy in each failed attempt to stop Brolly. Many scenes action packed and vividly colourful. The movie comes to an end which may or may not surprise you.","10/10"
"jolerozeerio","18 February 2023","This is my favorite of the Ant Man trilogy. In this movie, the Ant Family is taken hostage and spread across the Quantum Realm, discovering a truly dangerous madman at the center of this alternate universe plotting his escape. As always, the performances were incredibly fun to watch and it was nice being able to spend time with the Langs and the Pym's as they trek across this vast and surreal landscape.Certain characters get more play than others, which is regrettable. Evangeline Lilly feels sidelined in this film which doesn't feel right given her characters importance in these movies thus far. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer are charming as ever, Paul Rudd feels dynamic and confident in his third solo hero outing, but the real gem of this story is Jonathan Majors and Kang the Conqueror.Unlike He Who Remains, Kang is without whimsy. He isn't playful or charming, he is ruthless and deeply driven to escape the Quantum Realm to continue his conquest across time and space. He is played with genuine menace and arrogance, truly displaying the danger he represents to the Avengers and the multiverse as a whole.Overall, this is a strong, albeit inconsistent start to the MCU's Phase Five with the promise of more adventure to come.","2/10"

Absolutely shameful from David Ayer and a who i dont care to search of a writer. A complete garbage film with their twist of unoriginality coupled with a weak story filled with copy n paste and cheesy actors they found on Skid Row.Disregarding the fact they couldn't come up with anything on their own. This film is riddled with bad scenes to corny lines that should have been on the chopping block or on B roll. But that shows you exactly what this production was about. Smoking weed, finding a script near the bottom of the pile, getting some semi big names and praying they make money.Hell, even the cameras they used were questionable.This film was hard to watch and if you're new to the movie scene (your very first movie) this might slip and be alright. Itll set the bar for every other movie to be great.","2/10"
"jon-22643","2 September 2023","Sure, many will argue it could have been much better, I agree that the plot is messy, and the story and execution could be better, still you should remember that Ford is an old dude now and also his character in the movie, and old man can't run, fight or do all the things his young character could the the prior movies.Ford is giving everything he's got in the movie, despite his age. His character also straggles with aging and all that comes with it along the entire movie.It's not a secrete that for a small portion of the movie the makers used special effects to make him look young, for me it was the best portion, it brought back the feeling of the 1st movie, it felt like a tribute to this iconic character and also to Ford.All the actors are giving a great performance, I wish the plot would be tighter, but it is what it is.In short, this last chapter is about old man Indiana Jones, a beaten and broken man (the reason is discovered later in the movie), who is forced, despite of his will, into his last adventure that will hopefully save his spirit, you'll need to watch the movie to understand.I liked the movie and you will too.","7/10"
"jon-j-henry","3 June 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an absolute masterpiece that belongs in the top echelon of films. It has left an indelible mark on me, much like the original Matrix. This Marvel instalment stands out as the epitome of cinematic brilliance, captivating and spellbinding from the opening scene to the closing credits.The film's genius lies in its ability to ingeniously expand upon the groundwork laid by its predecessor, ""Into the Spider-Verse."" It seamlessly incorporates the multiverse concept, skilfully presenting it in a manner that is accessible and engrossing without overwhelming the audience. As someone who initially had reservations about the concept within the MCU, I must say that this film has erased all doubts, handling the multiverse with perfect finesse.The animation in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is nothing short of breathtaking. It effortlessly merges various art styles, resulting in a visual feast for the eyes. Every frame is meticulously crafted, showcasing a remarkable attention to detail. The vibrant colours and dynamic action sequences transport viewers into a vividly immersive comic book world that is unlike anything seen before.The characters in the film are captivating and richly developed. Miles Morales, the lead Spider-Man, continues to shine as a relatable and inspiring hero. His personal growth and journey are skilfully explored, allowing the audience to deeply empathise with his experiences. The introduction of new characters injects a fresh dose of excitement into the story, each bringing their unique personality and motivations, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.The storytelling in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is an exhilarating roller coaster ride. It masterfully blends humour, heart, and jaw-dropping action sequences to create an enthralling narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The carefully curated soundtrack elevates the film even further, perfectly complementing the on-screen energy and eliciting the desired emotions in every scene.Whilst the film leaves certain questions unanswered, it serves as a tantalising setup for what lies ahead. It leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the Spider-Verse saga, craving further exploration and revelation.In summary, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an unparalleled cinematic achievement. It surpasses its predecessor in every way, delivering an awe-inspiring visual experience, compelling characters, and a masterfully crafted storyline. This film is not only a must-watch for Spider-Man enthusiasts but also a testament to the power of storytelling and groundbreaking animation. Prepare to be swept away into the mesmerising world of the Spider-Verse once again, and savour every extraordinary moment.","5/10"
"jon.h.ochiai","16 July 2017","What is the nature of humanity? Is humanity being human? In the unspoken scene in Director Matt Reeves's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the mute blonde girl, played by amazing Amaih Miller, cries as she takes the cherry blossom flower from her hair and places upon the fallen ape, who sacrificed to save Simian messiah Caesar, played by powerful Andy Serkis. The cherry blossom was the gift of kindness from the Ape. No words are spoken as tears fall from the girl's eyes, and Michael Giacchino's eloquent score breaks our hearts. Humanity is valuing all life, and seeing the nobility in that life. That is the beauty of Writer and Director Matt Reeves's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"". His narrative imagery is pristine and bold. The movie opens in the misty forest as Special Forces commandos attack the outpost of Ape Leader Caesar. Caesar demonstrating his acute strategy defeats the soldiers. He sends a message to the survivors, ""I did not start this war"" In this final chapter of the trilogy, Caesar distinguishes himself as the brave merciful leader hoping to coexist with Man, who only seeks annihilation of the Apes. But Caesar suffers tragedy at the hands of the Colonel, played by charismatic manic Woody Harrelson. The Colonel is without mercy, and now the noble Caesar wants his revenge. The imagery of ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is stunning. Michael Seresin's cinematography is astounding. He opens with the misty forest weapons battle. The snowy prison compound run by the Colonel is austere and foreboding. He captures the freedom and spirit of our heroes as their horses gallop along the beach at sunset. The visual portraits give life to the poignant narrative written by Reeves and Mark Bomback. Andy Serkis is a wonder as Caesar. His performance is the masterful blend of CGI and powerful actor. We see the compassion, fear, and courage in Caesar's human eyes and gentle visage. As Caesar we believe in the humanity of his kind, and doubt our own. Caesar's defining other is Harrelson's Colonel, who embodies man's inhumanity to all. Harrelson's Colonel is a take on Colonel Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Heart of Darkness"". His madness is visceral. He tells Caesar of his own actions, ""You are taking this way too personal."" Reeves eloquently unveils the Colonel's own tragic irony. In the storyline, the Simian Virus mutates Apes with great intellect and speaking language. Conversely, the virus robs humans of speaking, and devolves them to the vastly primitive animal. Reeves brilliantly intertwines the captivating dialogue and sign language of the evolving Apes. This represents the new stage of evolution and the new order. However, even evolution meets with resistance, especially in the human concerns. Perhaps, mercy is the most profound distinction of humanity. Reeves powerfully explores this in ""War"". There is not black and white resolution in the gray nature of the world we live. I think Reeves spends a little too much time in the snowy Ape prison, time slowly ebbs there. However, ""War"" has distinct power and nobility. It's amazing that the story of evolving Apes inspire, and make us think about our own humanity. Have compassion and value all life. The Ape leader Caesar reminds of this, and so does Director Reeves. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the year's best. It makes us look into our very souls, as well.","1/10"

"jonathan-972-150139","30 June 2023","People come to review threads to get some semblance of an idea of public sentiment. That includes negative & positive takes. You either like something, dislike it, or feel ambivalent towards it. People are allowed to have those sentiments. No matter what the paid contributors might have to say on the matter. And if they are disregarded in the forums by having their opinions blacklisted, believe me, they will vote with their wallets.My personal take on this movie is that it was indeed completely unnecessary. It doesn't feel glued to anything else canonical. Indy is a miserable shell of his former self. It has been made crystal clear by the creators that some of the casting decisions are there strictly for the purposes of agenda. But the biggest crime IMO is that it simply isn't good.PWB is shoehorned in there to add dimensions of a character without any depth. She's not funny enough to be comical. She's not attractive enough to be appealing. And don't get me started on her pithy diatribe about capitalism. There's nothing more that I want to see than a bunch of elitist actors funded by one of the most monolithic corporations on the planet lecture me about the evils of a capitalist society.Bottom line: If you like it, it's your business. But this one is a solid ""no"" for me.RIP, Indy. We'll always have Raiders and the Last Crusade.","6/10"

"jonnyfendi","16 December 2012","Thiz is a simple movie with stunning visual portrayal of a spiritual journey. It starts like Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" (2003) where everything is odd and magical, steps like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008) with its compelling flashback in storytelling and it feels like Tom Hank's ""Cast Away"" (2000), only thiz time the survivor is not accompanied by Wilson the volleyball, but with something called Richard Parker. It is a courageous adventure story about a young boy named Piscine (Suraj Sharma), who unfortunately lost all his family in sinking ship. His survival effort along with all the animals, especially with a ferocious Bengal tiger, brings him to an understanding of life as a whole. The newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sufficient performance to describe a boy who has to survive nature. Adil Hussain and Tabu make brief but memorable appearances as Pi's father and mother. On the other hand, I think that Irrfan Khan could have been better as Adult Pi. His central role as the storyteller is just enough, not extraordinary, not even close, compared to Gloria Stuart as Old Rose in ""Titanic"" (1997). Ang Lee who is formerly known as the Director of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), ""Hulk"" (2003) and the controversial drama ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), wrapping thiz movie with astonishing visual treat. ""The Storm Scene"" is one of the remarkable moments in thiz movie. I bet you won't get thiz experience before in any other movies. Thiz is something that you have never seen before, followed by other scenes like ""The Giant Whale Scene"", ""The Flying Fish Scene"" and my favorite ""The Exotic Meerkat Island"". I think thiz movie has lots of powerful philosophies all over the place. It's like metaphor in metaphor, there comes a point in everyone's life, thiz will be something that needs to be thought about. It's emotionally gratifying. Actually, the movie is not just about survival, it's not even about the sinking ship, and it's definitely not about the tiger. It's simply about your relationship with God. In the end, we know very well. In every spiritual journey, your greatest enemy is none other than yourself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com","7/10"

Wonderful stuff - chewing the scenery from second one. The Stath had no problem identifying Lazerous' team in a crowded building as they were all dressed like extras in an MC Hammer video.Did enjoy it - had a good laugh - but it is not great.","3/10"

"jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","10/10"
"jordyntsmith","7 June 2023","Miles Morales gets into the Spiderverse again. The stakes are higher, the emotions are stronger, and life is harder - things we all identify with.While this movie was highly anticipated, I feared it would be over hyped. Into the Spiderverse seemed perfect - a fantastic standalone movie that a sequel has the potential to ruin. BUT, Across the Spiderverse does it. It masterfully continues where the original picked up, connecting lose ends, and expanding the franchise seemlessly. Somehow, this film grounds the multiverse trope with its focus on human emotion, themes of loss, finding your purpose, and coming of age. Miles and Gwen are characters I really shouldn't identify with, but I do. Their stories and feelings are compelling, and what make this soon to be trilogy so special.Go watch it. Though it may be too intense for some littles, this movie (and the first one) are must-see.","10/10"
"Jorgosch","28 April 2019","Avengers: Endgame is not a bad movie at all. It's just not what it's made out to be - supposedly one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, you have seasoned actors who deliver the necessary emotions which are put into scene well enough and several strings from other movies and tv series are tied together. But that alone doesn't make a movie great per se, that's just good planning.The story itself is your basic time travel retcon and there aren't any clever twists that were hidden in Infinity War. 2 out of 3 hours of the movie is characters talking as a fan service, one hour is plot advancement. You get your deus ex machina (Captain Marvel) who tips the balance this time while she was conveniently absent in the last movie. You get Iron Man, who doesn't even have superhuman abilities, performing a feat that should have killed him right away according to the lore.The movie is satisfying yes, but that doesn't make it great. Nothing of what happens is particularly awe inspiring, surprising or new. With all the talking, it rather feels like a double episode that finishes off a tv show.And to be honest, placing this among the greatest movies of all time feels like an insult to the great ones which excel in all possible departments - acting, story, score, cinematogrpahy, blocking etc. But I guess a generation that votes for a president who promises to make America great again can also vote such a movie as one of the greatest. Both aren't.","10/10"

There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season.","9/10"

"joshbarton15","12 July 2017","Maintaining such a high standard of quality throughout a franchise is one of the toughest challenges in filmmaking however, it's a challenge that War for the Planet of the Apes thrives on, going on to become the best of the Planet of the Apes reboot series. Growing in stature and intelligence, mirroring the journey of Caesar throughout the series, each film has delivered and in War for the Planet of the Apes, it has a stunning final chapter.Two years have passed since events in San Francisco shattered any chance of peace between humans and apes. The two species have been at war with each side suffering major losses. Wrestling with his darker instincts, Caesar (Andy Serkis) ventures out to confront the Colonel (Woody Harrelson), a man hellbent on wiping out Caesar and the rest of the apes.Opening with an incredibly tense sequence that sees a group of soldiers closing in on an ape trench where Caesar is hiding, War for the Planet of the Apes builds on the foundations laid by its two predecessors to deliver a film that never loses focus of its narrative, all while continuing to deliver spectacle in abundance. The strong narrative is a key feature of the series and War of the Planet of the Apes exceeded my expectations with the story it tells. The strained relationship between humans and apes is just the tip of the iceberg and, if you thought things got bad between the two in the previous films, you haven't seen anything yet.Caesar remains a focal point for this film and rightly so. We see the strength of Caesar as a leader of both the apes and a family but we also get to see the weakness he has of controlling his conflicting emotions towards humans, visions of Koba haunting him as he must decide what's best for the apes. The majority of the film is spent with the apes and it's a true testament to both the visual effects and the motion capture performances that the film is able to do this.Matt Reeves returns to direct this instalment and this is easily his most accomplished piece of work yet, beating the stellar work he did on Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Whether it's building tension, evoking emotion or delivering pulsating action, Reeves delivers plenty of memorable moments to go with some of the great moments in the series. Reeves' film is accompanied by the outstanding visual effects that have grown better and better with each film, some breathtaking cinematography from Michael Seresin and Michael Giacchino's score that brilliantly accentuates the interchange of emotions throughout.Coming to the performances, War for the Planet of the Apes continues the groundbreaking work done with motion capture performance throughout the series. Andy Serkis is once again superb in the role of Caesar, giving arguably his best performance to date, conveying such a range of emotion phenomenally well. The time has come for Serkis to get the recognition he deserves with some awards nominations because what he does with the character of Caesar is nothing short of spectacular. Serkis is joined by the returning Karin Konoval as Maurice and Terry Notary as Rocket, who both continue the solid work they've done before in the series. It's new character Bad Ape, played by Steve Zahn, that will no doubt steal the show for many people, his eccentricity and likability making him such a stand out from the rest of the ape characters. He comes with a lot of humour and I think they pitched it perfectly, Bad Ape not becoming annoying or unfunny at any point. I was looking forward to Woody Harrelson's presence in the film and, while I thought he was very good as the Colonel, I was genuinely surprised at the direction his character went, and I'm sure I won't be the only one.Closing out a trilogy is never easy but the final moments of War for the Planet of the Apes is one of those times where there is nothing but silence from the audience out of sheer captivation and respect. It's a stunningly triumphant final chapter in what has to go down as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history.","10/10"
"joshgcobbjc","3 February 2024","If you're looking for something intelligent this is not your movie. If you're looking for mindless entertainment this is a perfect movie for you. Jason Statham does his usual bald British tough guy thing. This may not be groundbreaking, however as usual it is entertaining to watch him beat up FBI agents and criminals alike. Josh Hutcherson does surprisingly well as the movies villain. He does a very good job of playing a spoiled rich doosh bag that manages to get into WAY over his head. Several famous actors of yesteryear make appearances just to not do much and disappear after one or two scenes. There is also one major plot thread that is just dropped about halfway through the movie. Over all I feel pretty confident giving this movie a seven out of ten.","7/10"
"joshkej-84077","30 April 2018","I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War. Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","9/10"
"Joshmcswain","8 December 2023","Minor spoilers ahead.I watched this film with no expectations since most reviews said it was not good. However, I went into it with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised. This isn't some amazing work of cinema, but it's not a bad way to spend 2.5 hours. Watching it once, I am not sure I'd watch it again but it's an alright movie.The biggest quibble is the film is too long. There could have been 15-20 minutes trimmed off the film to make it less of a drag. The opening scene drags, it could have just been Indy stealing the dial instead of an extended scene about the lance that pierced the side of Jesus is a fake and then it's not relevant to the rest of the story.The chase scene was long and could have been shortened.We know that Indiana Jones is about how Indy is changed by those around him, and while he is reconciled with a long lost goddaughter that really can't outdo his long lost son from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Regardless of what you think of Crystal Skull, it seemed like a natural conclusion for Indy.So all in all, as long as your don't have your mind made up beforehand you'll enjoy it even though it is flawed.","6/10"

"jp_91","17 January 2024","""The Beekeeper"" is one of the best action films of recent years, its script that includes living in a bee hive is included in the lives of the human characters, from heroes to villains and results in a well-made story. The cast is good in their performances, although Jason Statham seems to always play the same character, while Josh Hutcherson plays the villain masterfully. The action scenes are exciting and violent, the humor used is very good and sometimes exceeds the ridiculous but manages to achieve its goal. The cinematography is very good, the costume design is outstanding and the digital special effects are a little unrealistic in some scenes. The greatest success of the film is its script, although it is worth mentioning that at times it is implausible but every action film is. A good movie for the beginning of 2024.","8/10"

Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!","10/10"

"jtindahouse","18 February 2013","Just before I left to see Life of Pi my cat had found a mouse in the garage. It got me to thinking about the food chain and the frailty of life. But it also got me to thinking about why we value one life so differently from the next. Something as simple as the size of an animal can determine how much we care for that animal. No one gives it a second thought if they find a mouse dead in the street, but if they come across a giraffe or an elephant, (which probably have a fifth of the character) in the same state, it'll bother them to no end. It was an amazing coincidence for me then, when the movie had an element of these themes about it too. It took it even further making us question one's faith and even questioning the legitimacy of what we've just seen.Life of Pi is told from the point of view of the main character Pi Patel, many years after he was the survivor of a sunken ship and spent 227 days at sea accompanied by a ferocious tiger. The story has a lot of similarities with Cast Away, the most obvious probably being the sole relationship of an unexpected companion. In Cast Away it was a volleyball, here it is a tiger. While it is a necessary plot device to have these ""characters"" in the story, it is also fascinating to see just how close and reliant the main character becomes on them. Something that I imagine would actually genuinely be the case if you were in that situation.The cinematography is astonishing throughout and seeing it in 3D (even though I'm not the biggest fan of the format) was just the icing on the cake. This is a tough film to review because it leaves itself very open to interpretation. The message boards are flooded with questions and every answer to them is unique and of a slightly different opinion. Ang Lee has done well in keeping this a talked about and debated piece of cinema. I have my own opinions on most of the questions too, but to throw them out there now would be wrong. It could lead you to come to a conclusion you wouldn't otherwise have come to and it would also ruin a bit of what is fun about the ending. Go in with an open mind, form your own opinions and then take the time to read some other people's ones too. Life of Pi can be as much fun after the film as it is during.","8/10"
"jtindahouse","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","8/10"
"jtindahouse","6 May 2019","Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.","10/10"
"jtknudson","26 January 2024","If anyone other than Jason Statham played lead in this film, it would get a 0/10 stars. He carried this movie, which has a great base plot, but totally fails on delivery and back story. They took a fantastic and interesting concept, and completely wasted it. They need to remove it from theaters, edit out everything but Statham being Statham. Movie would have made more sense without a plot.Is Hollywood hard up for writers these days? Was the entire budget spent on Statham and the rights to the subject material? Has to be the case. Credits should have rolled after he torched and blew up the first building belonging to the film's ""villains"".Two things are true about The Beekeeper...

"jtkwtc","23 April 2023","Ok Marvel/Disney, after so many movies rehashing the same tired story tropes is getting tiresome. The movies remind me of 80s action movies where bad guys can't hit a single target and they never immobilize the good guys so they can escape 4 times before the finale. Oh wait...they pause to espouse gibberish to allow the ""heroes"" to alter their fate. This movie was predictable and dull.Without much humor and too many similar leads without much charisma it is a waste of the cast and the budget.I also saw many similarities to Star Wars with lots of locale animations. I won't even mention the ending....makes no sense.","7/10"
"JTMokko","12 May 2013","Life of Pi was a disappointment. Framework of the story, with a reporter interviewing Pi, was totally unnecessary - it made it difficult to get involved with the fate of the main character - after all he would survive to live conventional suburban life. Story didn't move me at all. Whole time I was just wondering are the filmmakers selling this story as a real story, based on a fact, or as a fantasy film. As a 'based on a true story' it could not happen - tiger would eat a scrawny Indian boy in a heartbeat if it was truly hungry and the whole island thing didn't help the realism at all. As a fantasy film, the story needed magic carpet ride and a giant - that would do it. In the frame story the reporter said that: ""You had a story that would make me believe in God."" That was setting the aspiration of the story quite high. I was ready to yell ""Hallelujah"" or ""Allah Akbar"" in the moment story would do it's magic, but it really never happened. Story shouldn't promise something that it can't deliver.Special effects were very good and actors did their job well - although I was surprised that Depardieu had so little screen time. Better survival film would be Cast away (2000) and better depiction of storm was in The Perfect Storm (2000).","9/10"

"judemcrobbie","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","8/10"
"juergenmeyerdrentwede","24 June 2023","How to start? This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad that i am struggling to find words which would not result in a cancellation of this comment. I can not believe that this movie is made by the same studio that made Endgame or Avengers or even She Hulk! It is basically 2+ hours of lifeless CGI porn with a story that is an insult to viewers above the age of six. I would state that the writing is lazy, but that would be an insult to all the lazy writers out there. The moments in the storytelling that actually show some kind of inspiration are less than a minute in combination. The rest is utter and complete waste. You have an ursupator equipped with an army capable of conquering complete worlds? No Problemo, just let an angry teenager hold a 10-second-speech and the mob will rise and overcome. The antagonist is an organism designed only for killing? Just make him the worst possible fighter and let him change his mind by the snap of a finger.Actually, if this is the storytelling of modern Hollywood, i can't wait for AI to write movies. It can not be worse than this.","7/10"

"julianmarku","25 January 2024","This movie starts like a John Wick movie and ends like Jason Statham movie.It has a lot of cool fight scenes and I have to say I like Jason Statham in this movie because the director isn't trying to make a complicated story.In fact I would say that the director subverts almost every John Wick-ism it can stumble on. And anyone who is a fan of John Wick can have a good laugh about it.I have to praise the casting for this movie. Everyone and I mean everyone does their jobs great.Everyone from Jason Statham to Jeremy Irons is so good but with a script too small that it has to speed through the story. For example, early in the movie you will meet a character played by British actor David Witts, he didn't play a very important role but his performance impressed me enough to look him up. (I couldn't even tell he was British). Great actor, with a great face, born in the wrong time.It honestly feels like the weakest part about the movie was the script. But at least it's very tight and quick, not like the 3 hour special theatrical releases these days. I can at least respect that. You can watch this movie and not need to check your phone for the time every 15 minutes.All in all. It's a great Jason Statham popcorn action movie. Just maybe don't watch it with friends that have some strong political opinions...","8/10"
"Junreviews","16 December 2012","The title of this review may seem offensive to some people, especially those who exceptionally enjoy the marvelous and emotional performance by Tom Hanks. As much as my affinity towards ""Cast away"" still vividly remains in my memory after 12 years, I can honestly say ""Life of Pie"", based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel is impressive in terms of both staging and acting.The plot is simply about a French-Indian boy, Pie, encounters a life-threatening shipwreck during immigration to Canada with his family and a herd of Family-run Zoo animals caged in the Japanese cargo ship to start a new life. However, the main story focuses on Pie and the tiger, aka Richard Parker, trying to survive after being stranded in middle of the ocean. The two who consider each other as enemies developing a heartwarming friendship by going through all sorts of conflicts with hand-to-mouth supplements on the rescue boat is what makes this movie adventurous and distinguished. The Visual effects consists of computer generated animals that interact with people. The magnificent underwater scene amuses me with a detailed presentation along with a giant wave where tremendous storm devours the ship. The most amazing part of the movie is to be able to witness the surreal CG tiger who steals the thunder of other animals using its fierce eye and charisma.On top of that, a young and novice actor, Suraj Sharma should get nominated for an Award for his incredible performance. Despite there are hardly anyone around him while shooting due to the large amount of CG used in the movie, he executes his role without being awkward. Endeavoring to engage with imaginary CG animals and trying to stay focused while being surrounded by the sea hazards must be as challenging as what Tom Hanks did in ""Cast away."" I can see a bright future ahead of him.Overall, this is an emotional and inspiring film for everyone who loves watching the nature and survival stories. One flaw of this movie would be a slow-paced storytelling. Things that transpire in the beginning is partially incoherent. However, that does not negate the fact that this is worth watching as it also contains a lot of hidden messages that are worth learning.","10/10"
"justahunch-70549","30 December 2023","The world could certainly have lived without this 5th sequel to a great movie, but it's far, far better than the last one and it has quite a few merits that I really wasn't expecting. Plot wise it's just more of the same hunting and fighting for antiquities with the Nazis with a tomboy female sidekick to assist along with a small kid. That sidekick is this film's secret weapon. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is just made for this and she is a delight throughout. I was initially very turned off by the idea of de-aging Harrison Ford, but it is very well done and while it occasionally briefly looks unreal, for the most part it works well. I don't approve of the process, but that's for another discussion. It kind of makes me sad that that person doesn't exist anymore, but the whole movie is about nostalgia and action which is just about nonstop from beginning to end. I haven't any idea why Antonio Banderas is here in a teeny tiny role of no significance. Has the feel of parts being left on the cutting room floor. What can I say?! I expected to dislike it and I found it quite enjoyable and I assume, as well as hope, that this is the finale!","9/10"
"justahunch-70549","8 May 2022","Hadn't seen this since it was first released. Once it gets past a lot of religious issues/questions and a set up for what the movie is really about, it is pretty awesome to view. The CGI here is really amazing though sometimes occasionally too artificially beautiful, but nevertheless, this is a gorgeous film. It is also extremely original, exciting and inventive with again, too pretty for words cinematography. The ending of the amazing adventure within the film is also rather touching and a little sad when all is said and done. All in all, it's a pretty impressive piece of craftsmanship.","10/10"

War for the Planet of the Apes was a satisfiable conclusion to a great run.Solid story with some minor flaws but has some of the elements from the prequel. Characters are good, tbh it's not as good as the prequel but still are decent and have their own quriks, the most interesting being the Colonel and Nova, two humans who are tragic and sad because of ther origins.

Beautiful photography, excellent acting, original screenplay based on a sensitive and well recognized novel that, besides allowing enjoy a good movie with amazing scenes (surely many computer generated (CGI)) provides an elaborate metaphor for life, spirituality, struggle and all those elements that are presented to us throughout the different stages of our existence. Even the most difficult, the most aggressive opponents, can be overcome given that cannot be avoided.It is commented that seeing in 3D is even more exciting.I have not read the novel by Yann Martel, but I will.","9/10"
"jyszxpxqfhrg","15 January 2024","There is too much going on in this film. It shows in both the runtime and pacing. They were trying to go too big too fast. It should've been multiple different movies. Gwen could've had her own film based on the introduction.You don't get enough time to relate with the characters or appreciate the story beats. They just keep whipping you from one major event to another. There are also several weird plot holes as a result. It just brain my mind numb by the end.This remind me of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. The writers wanted to squeeze a whole cinematic universe's worth of content into one movie. Some people may love the ambition, but I just don't see the masterpiece everyone else is talking about.","10/10"
"jzrises","13 January 2024","I did not expect much before watching it, but after coming out of the theater, I just want to tell other potential audience- don't waste your time and money. The movie is trying to creat a hero, but at what cost? Killing dozens of innocent civilians ? The No. 1 bad guy needs to rely on fraudulent money from those elder people whereas his mother is the president?.... The whole story is brain damaged made. Jason should not accept such a role in his career . Hollywood should stop using those no brain made scripts but review themselves on how to make really meaningful movies, like Godzilla minus one.","1/10"
"k-s-e-n-i-y-a","12 January 2024","Lately, Hollywood has been making movies that are so over the top, complicated, and nothing like they used to make. This is a great movie where it reminds me of Hollywood 10 years back, a great movie, great storyline & actor. Its not over the top, and it doesn't have anything to too complex. I went to the cinema, and for the first time in a long time the cinema was almost full, even marvel movies no longer bring that many audience any more. Stop believing the low rating, I can't believe this rating is only 6.6, this movie should be voted at least 8 to 9. I believe this movie is highly underrated, don't believe it, and just go to the cinema. I'm 30 years of age, and if you're somebody around my age, and sick and tired of the latest garbage being shown in the cinemas, go to the cinema and see this movie, trust me, you won't be disappointed. I hope they make part 2!!","2/10"

I am lost for words, i am a jason statham fan, i pretty much like everything i did so far.I saw mention of fast X and hobbs and shaw but those movies clearly were better than this one beekeeper movie.The story is about a bunch of internet scammers who steal money via a fake anti virus software, this is kind of like commun world fraud that we read about in papers.But for some odd reason its a big operation and that place gets burned down, but the son of the rich father who started the whole thing takes heavy loss in money so wants revenge against Stantam character.Yes the action is good but the story is really ridiculous.

Also the fact that the movie is 3 plus hours long........Very over rated movie.","10/10"
"kaintrust","4 May 2019","Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth
This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances.
When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again.
I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much?
Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action.
If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed.","10/10"

"kakarotto-18426","21 December 2018","Dragon ball movies altogether were good with little different stories and super fights but always behind in animation this movie puts the best story with little past, bestest fight and new animation which is little nostalgic but still modern. About the story, previous movies show less things about antagonists but here broly has the perfect character unlike before. The best movie ever made my 2018 unforgettable.

"KalKenobi83","19 February 2023","Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania Starring Paul Rudd(Avengers:Endgame) as Scott Lang/Ant-Man ,Evangeline Lily (Crisis), Kathryn Newton(Detective Pikachu) as Cassie Lang/Stature, as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns ) as Janet Van Dyne, Katy O'Brian(The Mandalorian) as Jentorra, William Jackson Harper(The Good Place) as Quaz,Corey Stoll(First Man) as Darren Cross aka M. O. D. O. K , David Dastmalchian(The Suicide Squad,Dune Part 1) as Veb and Jonathan Majors (Loki, Devotion ) as Kang.I thought this was weaker than The Previous two Installments also it was great to see Paul Rudds Scott Lang get more serious lines of dialogue. Pfeiffers Janet Van Dyne and Majors Kang had the best performances of the film also it was great Kang had a larger role in his debut than Thanos in 2014's Guardians Of The Galaxy basically if Ronan and Thanos and his were flipped. Katy O'Brian had an underrated performance as Jentorra hope to see her in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The weakest role and performance was Kathryn Newtons Cassie Lang/Stature also it was a disservice what they did to Emma Furhmann that shouldve been her role all i could think when watching it was that shouldve been Furhmann also did a terrible impersonation of Abby Ryder Forston as well though Marvel has recasted Unknowns in Prominet since then Xochitl Gomez, Iman Velani and Tenoch Huerta Meija since then Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.Amazing Score By Christophe Beck(Frozen II), Cinematography By Bill Pope(Alita: Battle Angel ) and Direction By Peyton Reed(Ant-Man And The Wasp) Not as Good as Previous Ant-Man films but better use of the Future Big Bad then GOTG Vol. 1.

"kamykaza","20 July 2017","The best thing you can do about War for the Planet of the Apes is, not watch it. If you love or like the first two parts, don't watch it, if this is your first glance to the trilogy, don't watch it. If you are 5 years old and you like apes, enjoy. Where to start? The first half our of the movie can stand alongside the other two entries. It's directing, acting, effects and musical score once again remind us that a good mature sf-drama is not only fiction. But, to my big disappointment after that the movie goes only downhill. As the first movie was one of the most pleasant surprises (where I expected superficial mindless action) this movie is one of the biggest disappointment. There are so many flaws to the story, so many moments that make no sense at all, that the viewers literally cannot feel for the characters. The movie is full of this melodramatic close up, very slow scene that should give meaning to the moment, but they don't because the movie doesn't give us a reason to care for the characters, or for that matter, the world. The main idea behind the movie, that the good guys (apes) have mercy and bad guys (people) don't is also very washed up, seen 100 times and not well done. Acting is for the biggest part CGI, done very well. Woody, doesn't shine, but his character has no time to develop, so he has to do the cliché scene: ""This is why I am evil and this is my evil plan, now I will not kill you but close you in a prison, even though I am ruthless and merciless"" Makes this movie a James Bond movie from the 70s, and not a closure to a great trilogy about one of the most interesting sc-fi stories. So, as I said in the beginning, the best thing you can do, is not watch the movie, and fantasize about how great this movie could have been. Matt Reevs, shame on you.","2/10"

"Karamakate","5 June 2023","Into the Spider-Verse showed us just a crumb of visual possibilities; Across the Spider-Verse doesn't hold back and brings us the most stunning visuals we've ever seen in animation. The details in the animation is mindblowing, like Miles' new suit that feels vibrant with the colors and texture.This is brave storytelling, this is art, this is the pure meaning with film and this is a breathtaking absolute masterpiece.The runtime is deserved and enjoyable thru out, it dares to set it own terms with giving us the plot and hang with the characters. There are brilliant tie-ins to the established multiverse, the character gallery is even better than Into the Spider-Verse and you can really feel the high stakes. Truly unpredictable and I wasn't prepared at all for the ending.Go watch it on IMAX-screen!","7/10"

"karinahatem","2 July 2023","Other than the name and the music, this had zero elements of Indiana Jones. Very disappointing and annoying. Stupid story with a plot that got too many holes and unbelievable mistakes, starting with the knife being a fake after a few seconds from looking at it, all the puzzles and codes being cracked in a matter of a minute or two. Silly action scenes. Too many special effects and SGI, that one can tell that Harrison's scenes were not real, also most of his scenes were done by a stunt double, no wonder him being over 80 years old. There were too many unnecessary characters, like Sallah and Renaldo. Phoebe's and Teddy's characters were most annoying, which I believe ruined the movie. Overall, dry disappointing and annoying movie.","7/10"
"karmazyn","8 May 2019","Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.
The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.","10/10"
"Kassdhal","1 July 2023","Indiana Jones is one of the greatest characters in the history of cinema.IJ DoD is just a very sad way to part with this beloved icon.Five main issues here
1. Indiana Jokes has become an old and sad man that had lost the energy and optimism that he had in his entire life
2. The movie is clearly made to position Helena as the next generation but she lacks the gravitas, moral compass and character arc that would enable anything close to that
3. The villains are « meh » at best. How come you couldn't write something better for someone as talented as Mads Mikkelsen probably show the lack of drive in the writing room
4. The film is way too long. You could have cut 30min and still make it
5. Overall the film lacks charm and cohesiveness, the characters have no chemistry with each other, and it feels like a chore instead of a joy.Crystal Skull felt like an Indiana jones movie even if it was the weakest of the série. DoD is just very weak and a very sad departure of a beloved character.","5/10"
"kassdo","3 February 2024","The first twenty minutes started of so well despite some of the required politically correct content. It was great to see Phyliss Rashad but her screen time was too short. The FBI daughter reminded me of Ambiguous Pat from SNL. Dealing with Mom Issues - Mom always like her older war hero brother. It fell apart for me with cartoonish female beekeeper assign. Then later on the even bigger lout dressed in yellow.Those oddities aside, the premise of taking down a criminal call center empire preying/stealing the life saving of elderly via a pc hack was new to me. A great foil for Stratham Justice. Obviously for international distribution, they kept the centers/organization in USA. Not obvious bad actors like China, Russia or Ukraine. Overall it delivered the fluff I would expect from that type of movie.","9/10"
"KayBay87","30 July 2023","This final installment of the Indiana Jones series was somewhat of a letdown. I feel like the opportunity for an excellent story was missed. I understand that Indiana Jones is older in this installment but there was something missing, I can't put my finger on it. Was it the writers aim for us to feel a little sorry for Indy? I wonder. In addition, this film didn't have the wit we have grown accustomed to from the franchise and WOW there was so much killing/shooting in this installment, I actually was kind of surprised by that. The killings were more than I have ever seen during this series. There was a little girl sitting in front of me and I could only imagine her mother regret for bringing her to see this particular movie. Some positives was the action scenes were typical Indian Jones flare and were exciting and enjoyable. I must say the character Helena was not likable, but maybe she wasn't meant to be and the young boy in the movie seemed thrown into the script, not much added value in my opinion. It was nice seeing some cameo appearances and the final scenes were heartwarming. I don't regret going to see the movie because it is the last film in the series and I needed to see the film on the big screen, but if you are a true fan of the series like I am I suggest you go to the theater and send Indy off for ol times sake :)","9/10"
"KayMcDaniels","17 January 2019","This is the most epic Dragon Ball movie to date! Between Brolys transformations and Gokus I was floored! This movie does contain spoilers for the Tournament of Champions arc of Super, but we all kind of figured what was going to happen with that!I don't think words can describe how amazing Dragon Ball Super: Broly truly is! With the updated animation everything was extremely crisp and beautifully done! Even Whis got in on some of the action! It was also lovely to meet Gokus mother and have a much softer look at Bardock. Unfortunately some fan favorites were missing, but that didn't detract from the experience at all! Overall I would go see this movie a million times in theater if I had the funds to do so! My boyfriend and I wanted to try to stay behind to catch another viewing, but no luck.GO SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!!","9/10"
"KayMcDaniels","28 January 2019","Just got home from seeing Broly a second time, this time with my daughter, who is 9. Being her very first movie theater experience, this was a pretty momentous event, and she was thrilled to see a Dragon Ball movie as her first! I watched her more than the movie, because I wanted to make sure her reaction was just as much as mine was, and thank you Akira it was!Having said that, this movie was just as amazing the second time viewing as the first, as I'm sure it'll be the 50th! With exception of a very serious fan base in the audience (first viewing was opening night and it was packed with hardcore fans who applauded every transformation and cheered with every momentous moment, including Freizas terrible acting after killing Paragas!) Dragon Ball Super: Broly is without exception the best movie of this year!I know that most fans are up in arms over the change of origins story for both Broly and Goku, but I much prefer this to the previous origin story, as this one made Broly seem much more human and more relatable as a character rather than this overblown and overpowered character he was depicted as in the three previous Broly movies.The fact that this movie could potentially be included into the Dragon Ball Super canon makes it all the more wonderful! If I could rate this movie higher than 10 stars I would!","10/10"
"kbimadod","16 December 2023","This very sentence comes from the most annoying character of the movie, referring to Indy. And for the most part it's sadly true, he's not running the show. But he should be. Seemingly the writers for some reason failed to understand the essence of Indiana Jones. He's not supposed to be part of history, he needs to save it, preserve it. Yes he sees things that cannot be explained, magical, outworldly things, but he never loses sight of his calling: archeology: saving things that belong in a museum.An aging Indy should've opened many doors to highlight his experience, his wisdom, but unfortunately he needs to be saved far too often. Indy doesn't need to be saved! He's the one who saves the day!The story itself stays interesting, the casting is good, Harrison Ford still has it and there are scenes where the movie really shines, but sadly the creators misunderstood the core, the essence we grew to love.","3/10"
"kechhh","11 April 2013","I thought the storytelling and narrative were great. I loved how things were told in the past tense. The acting was also great.One part, obviously, which stood out completely was the CG effects. This movie was beautiful, and everything looked incredible. The waves, the water, the colors, the animals, the scenes, looked stunning.Despite these great parts, the movie fell short of the great potential it could have had. Though touting that the movie would make you believe in god, I found nothing in it doing so. While he did touch upon the idea of ""choosing what we want to believe"", I feel the idea was undeveloped. He could have developed a strong overarching universal message about life or choice, but he failed to pull through. The movie definitely set the stage and enabled him to do so if he really tried. Despite this, there really was no clear universal or moral message - it was way too ambiguous. For this reason, while this movie was good, it could have been even greater.","9/10"

"keelhaul-80856","22 November 2017","I generally love these films, from the old to new. This one is very high-budget, A-list film-making, but the title is stupid.I was expecting an awesome Braveheart-style throwdown, with several epic battles, in a campaign to decide the fate of Earth, with some intriguing political or betrayal or love-story subplots.The film should be called ""Ape Escape: Part 2"". Woody Allen, I mean Harrelson, turns in an honorable performance as the vengeful, cold colonel, and Caesar is always good. However, the film misled most moviegoers with the title. The movie is not really about the war campaign between apes and humans, but more about social messages, and rehashes the same exact storyline from many other ape films, including the original reboot to this trilogy. The film is well-shot, and looks beautiful. The trailers have an epic feel, but this doesn't really play out until the end of the movie. I feel SO MUCH MORE could have been done with this movie, but was built around a sorrowful worker escape plot, instead of a bad ass battle royal with political intrigue and a better script. This was kind of boring, aside from the great effects, and the few great moments between Caesar and Woody Harrelson. I am usually very much into these films, but this one had all of us like, ""meh"". It was going through the motions, with a huge budget, but I was very disappointed with such high expectations.","1/10"

How else? He embraced virtually every religion out there.Is this smart movie? Did it make you to think about anything? I did not find any single thought in this movie. Boring, annoying, terrible and painful to watch for 2 hours. Total waste of time and money in case you happened to see this in 3D.Now, having said my opinion about movie, I am going to see who are reviewers.

However to accept this movie I have to forget about the past three or four movies that this would be referencing.

"kekca","17 January 2014","When I first saw this movie I thought that it is not good - some animals in a boat and that till the end. The second time I watched it I said to myself - ""it is good"". Long time after that fragmentary visions of it were coming back to my consciousness. They got sense undressed.Pi is not in relation with mathematics. But it can be interpret like this - a continuously revealing essence repeating on each manifestation. Strongly metaphorical it starts the story of life on a continent, in a family, on a ship with society, on a boat, in loneliness and in the end in a new family.It is a description of human life, of its connection with nature and its creations. Of not overcoming abyss between man, animals and plants for which Sartre tells us. Of relation with God or the internal sense. Of described fantasy and trivial people. Things in the life of almost everyone of us.In spite of the long period in the boat the spectator co-experience much and is informed much. Like his own existence.

"kenjha","8 June 2013","After his ship is hit by a storm, a young Indian man finds himself adrift on a boat with a tiger. The cinematography is so dazzling that Lee won an Oscar for this, one of the few instances where a director has won without the film winning Best Picture. Unfortunately, Lee is better with the special effects than with the actors, whose performances are uneven at best. While the movie looks great, like pretty postcards, the script, based on a popular novel, is too weak to sustain interest. The story, disjointed and somewhat clumsily structured with flashbacks, is fantastic and nonsensical, and ultimately pointless. The characters are meant to be wise and worldly but come across as shallow caricatures.","5/10"
"kermitkid","30 March 2020","A good prequel trilogy! Take that, Star Wars! Looking at this through the context of the original from 1968, it's hard to know who to root for. The humans in this are horrible to the apes, but you think ""Well, they kind of deserve this, because they do the same thing to us in the original."" And yet you still sympathize with them. We're rooting for the bad guys and yet...we're not. The motion capture on the apes is amazing! Not since ""Avatar"" has there been such impressive effects. (Although I may redact that statement after I see ""Valerian"", but we'll see...) The detail on each ape is exquisite. If it weren't for the apes riding horseback and wielding guns, you would think this was a nature documentary. Woody Harrelson does a great job, although at some points it does feel like a repeat of his character from ""The Hunger Games."" As far as who to root for, it's hard to decide. Neither side is definitively good or evil. Some of the humans are horrible, but some just want to leave the apes alone, and have the war come to them. Some of the apes are even on the human side. The action sequences in this were way over the top (in a good way.) I honestly don't know how this film could be improved. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Most times I say ""I really enjoyed the movie except for this, this and this,"" but that didn't happen here. The emotion was so well conveyed. It makes you hate your own species and cry over a bunch of CGI Apes. Kind of ridiculous out loud, but it's so well written and acted, I wouldn't be suprised if this gets nominated for a few Oscars when awards season comes around.

"ketgup83","20 February 2013","Life of Pi was one of the most enthralling and visually stunning film that had brilliant story-line , powerful performances with decent screenplay.Pi (Suraj Sharma) is left alone on a life boat after his ship wrecks only to be in the company of a Bengal Tiger , a hyena , a Zebra and an orangutan. He must fight for survival in this adventurous and epic journey which makes him realize the ultimate purpose of life.Oscar winner director Ang Lee has taken one step ahead and done a fantastic job to adapt a novel and turn it into a beautiful movie. The movie is engrossing right from the beginning and certain scenes will keep you on the edge of seat. The brilliant portrayal of chemistry between the tiger and PI is the highlight of the film. You will feel that a man and a beast can be a good friends but ultimately the question might that can we make animal our best friend ? The movie begins with PI telling the story about his adventures in the flashback. The childhood of PI where he begins to believe in different religion , his search for truth and his journey from India to the ship has been executed brilliantly. The moment Pi encounters the ship-wreck and left alone on a life boat with wild animal , the movie takes a complete U-turn and depicts the relationship between tiger and Pi brilliantly. Soon , they develop a special bond which eventually breaks in the end. It is at this place where I felt the emotion content is missing and sympathetic feeling is mixed where Irrfan Khan expresses his concern for not receiving proper goodbye from the tiger. I felt this movie was great but not spectacular which would want me to see it again and again. However , screenplay is crispy keeping you entertained , art direction is heavenly , cinematography is awesome capturing the gorgeous locations and images , visual effects are the highlight of the film and is award-worthy. Suraj Sharma does a superb job as a newcomer. Irrfan Khan gives his best. Tabu is good.Overall , very nice film which was visually enthralling and asks a lot of questions to the audience. It is up to us to decide the answer. Good 3.5/5","9/10"
"kevin_robbins","17 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Antman, Wasp and their now teenage daughter who is ready to be a super hero herself. Her research leads her into the Quantum realm where her grandmother has secrets about her past. As her grandmother's secrets surface the family and all existence becomes at risk.This movie is directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On) and stars Paul Rudd (I love you, Man), Jonathan Majors (Lovecraft Country), Michelle Pfeiffer (Scarface), Kirk Douglas (Falling Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Kathryn Newton (Freaky).There was a lot to like about this movie. The cast is outstanding and everyone delivers a strong performance. Jonathan Majors was a tremendous villain and his mannerisms and the way he delivered his lines was perfect. The CGI and special effects to create the universe and the aliens in it were awesome. The makeup, masks and costumes were first rate. There were elements of the plot that were annoying, like how often Pfeiffer failed to inform her family about impending dangers, but the action sequences made up for where the storyline was flimsy.Overall, this is an above average addition to the super hero genre that I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing once.","6/10"
"kevin_robbins","6 February 2023","Life of Pi (2012) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a family that owns a zoo in India that plans to bring the animals to the US, sell them, and start a new life. The ship sinks and one of the sons in the family successfully survives on a lifeboat with an unexpected companion.This movie is directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and stars Suraj Sharma (Happy Death Day 2U), Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire), Tabu (Missing) and Rafe Spall (The Ritual).The storyline for this picture is unique, compelling and really captures the imagination. The characters are easy to root for and the circumstances are unbelievable, sad and magical at the same time. Any scene with an animal in it is amazing. The opening lion cage scene with the goat is excellent. Every scene in the boat is tremendous and the ultimate twist in the storyline is awesome. There's a whale scene that's beautiful and an island scenes that's super cool.Overall, this is a magical picture that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.","10/10"
"kezman436","17 October 2023","Tonally, technically and aesthetically, I felt it was very competent, and reminiscent of the franchise. However, I don't think the nuts and bolts of the plot and the Dial were elaborated, distinctive or engaging enough. The plot felt more like a hollow vehicle for set pieces.Longer than necessary in my opinion, and not sure if they strayed far enough from the 'race against the Nazis for treasure' formula. Jones' allies in this film weren't hugely memorable, and made me realise the importance of entertaining allies in previous instalments.I think overall, they didn't get the tone quite right for what should have been a loving celebration.","7/10"
"KFstudios2009","24 August 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a basic space adventure that don't offer anything new. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is way better, and when I watched this movie, I can't really say that I'm impressed. Ant-Man and his family travel to the Quantum Realm and has to defeat the High Emperor Kang. Man, something that has happened a million times, and ok, the visuals were great, that's Marvel's strength, but besides, not so much good. Acting and story was weak, and it was too long. The flashback of the characters was showed badly, they showed it in moments that didn't just feel right to put in there, and the introduction of new characters feeled too fast and rushed. It is surprising that they was so long in one place in the movie, for a space adventure, I think people should travel across many new places. In summary, I didn't take this movie too serious, beside visuals, nothing new to offer, Ant-Man dissapointed.","8/10"
"KFstudios2009","31 January 2024","I had high expectations for this movie, and in the end, this was just a normal action flick for a one time watch, nothing special that you are getting. I really liked the main character, the beekeeper, Adam Clay, that was performed by Jason Statham. I will tell about the performance first. Statham was very cool in his role, he put humor into the beekeeper and the personality he had was really well adapted by him. The badass face, dialogues and outfit made him a really dangerous keeper of bees. From the story side, I think the beekeeper agency concept was very cool, and the main character had a motive and good reason to kill so many people. I liked the metaphor about the hive, how the society system can be compared to it, and that sometimes, you just have to kill the bee queen (Watch the film to understand that part). The main antagonists, a group of rich hacker-scammers, were good enough for the role as the menacing bad guys. I just wished that The Boss for the bad guys could have a better backstory and have some more space in the film, make him more important, more concerned about the beekeeper, just something to make him better. The story had a good flow, yet it was very generic. The introduction for the beekeeper agency and the scammers in the beginning was cool, but later, they got out for ideas and just went into action. The thing is, I wished more plot, more that could happen, not only fighting. Anyways, a few action sequences were great and enjoyable, while others felt messy and unorganized (Something I have noticed in many action movies recently). The final act did build up a good suspense to the final point, and the ending was cool and it finished well. The acting was mostly carried by the badass Jason Statham, and the rest was mediocre and on a very low scale. You know how it is in an action movie, the main character is out for hunting, while there is always that one person that follows him? Well, there was something in here, too. A CiA agent that thinks the beekeeper had good intentions for killing, but she wants to stop him before he have killed to many. And she was kind of unnecessary when I think about it. She had a connection in the story, but this could work easily without her and they could put more story instead. She wasn't performed that well, too. Summarizing, The Beekeeper was an ok action flick that could have been much better, and if you like badass killers and actors like Vin Diesel, Jason Statham or Sylvester Stallone, this one is just for you.","10/10"
"kgprophet","1 July 2023","Modern filmmaking has learned by trial and error what makes a film that satisfies an audience. ""Ironman"" and the ""Force Awakens"" are good examples. Pacing, tone, and just the right amount of humour are some of the aspects of the formula that makes a good film. We can see the results of applying the formula to ""Tog Gun"", making for one of the most popular movies in recent times. It is interpreted by the public that the primary reason for making yet another Indiana Jones is to make up for the mostly negative reception of the 4th film.This is made evident in the excellent opening sequence that goes back to WWII and takes place on a moving train. Unfortunately no other action sequences in the film match that opening sequence. Another thing that will cause a reaction by audiences is the CGI effects to make Harrison Ford younger for that opening sequence. For one, it is still Harrison's 80 year old grandpa voice in this twenty-something version of him. The gratuitous effects throughout the film, along with this version of Ford where his face looks painted, gives this whole film a graphic novel vibe. Not a bad thing.So is the old magic still there? I feel Spielberg and Lucas touches as executive producers, probably tossing in additional gags or finding ways to amp up the tension. I think all will agree that one thing missing is more humour. Things get serious early in the film when innocent side characters are needlessly shot dead in cold blood. Yes, it makes the villains truly bad guys, but it just sets a more somber tone to the film. What about Shia laBeouf? He is replaced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who starred in the stunning ""Fleabag"" TV show. However, her character seems to be a one note piece of cardboard. She shows that she has a couple things up her sleeve later in the film, but she doesn't sell it very well. Compare the engaging version of Catwoman played Anne Hathaway in ""Dark Knight Rises"". Her character showed more heart in justifying her life. Then there is the new version of ""Short Round"". As well as he is as a child actor, his involvement seemed merely perfunctory. Then there is Mads Mikkelsen as the main antagonist. A former Nazi, he worked for the United States rocket program. He fills the role well, but subtract a point for other side characters that are not very engaging.Most of the film takes place in 1969, and involves the ticker tape parade given to the astronauts in New York City. Then it's off to other exotic locations like a typical Bond or Mission: Impossible film. Audiences will probably take note of the amount of CGI effects compared to the other films. Although there are sequences that have some bona fide stunts, even they have obvious background replacement. So yes, that detracts from the film.As I mentioned, pacing has been refined these days that keep the story rolling along. Not so with IJATDOD. At the end of the second act, things settle down with some extended dialogue sequences. If it is meant to add some character development or advance the story, there must have been a better way to do it. Because (drum roll please) it breaks the two hour rule! The extra half-hour overstays the audience's welcome. They want the Indiana Jones experience, but not when it drags the ending out like this. One would think Spielberg would have had the sensitivity if he was crafting this film to find the slow spots and figure out how to keep up the proper crackerjack movie type of pacing. So, subtract a point for going into extra innings.As a whole, there is enough Indiana Jones nostalgia for those who have those expectations. The story however is elongated unnecessarily, giving us periods of slow dialogue and unsuccessful attempts at character development. The very best element of this film that almost saves it is the rollicking score by the master composer John Williams. It elevates the film more than anything else. 6 out of 10.","8/10"

Animation perfect, soundtrack perfect, characters perfect, design perfect, coloring perfect, plot perfect, Antagonist perfect. I was ready to set for 4 hours if it was necessary that is how great it was. This movie could lead to the best triology ever made for a superhero, comic, animated movie ever. It was mind-blowing.

This one is so action packed with all your favorite avengers. I had every emotion and feeling under the sun while watching this. I got goosebumps, I cried, I laughed, I got excited, I had anxiety, I was nervous, I was angry, I was happy. This movie will definitely give you whiplash in the emotion department. But it is by far the best avenger movie to date! And considering that it's their last one, I'm happy about that. But I'm extremely sad that this is the end of this MCU universe and I will miss all of them so very very much. At least we still have Thor, who should be appearing in the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.","10/10"
"Killerb44","20 February 2023","Too much, too fast and jumbled emotionless story. It is not an awful movies but it does show how avengers will be full of women and men have to be shown as weak. Scott loses a lot of fights and the females in the story are always there to rescue him. On top of this it is yes another storyline where a girl is set to replace a guy in the hero role. Also the bad guy, Modok, becomes good because he is told not to be a d!ck. It makes no sense. At any rate the movie tries, once again, to put too much in this movie and it's a jumbled mess. It is worth a watch for the ant man character and Kang. But there is a lot you could fast forward through so I would wait until it's on Disney+.","7/10"

"kindofblue-78221","27 December 2023","Let's be clear Harrison was 80 when the film was made.How do people expect a man of this age to look?He's very very fit considering. I'd take his agility now and I'm 19 years his junior.I love parts 1-3 of the series. Part 4 doesn't count for me.I expected more of the same with part 5. Instead we get a brilliant nonstop ride through the world
It's great fun. Harrison is on top form.Yes I was surprised he agreed to do the film. You can't turn back time even in indies world
Or can they?Indy is really does manage to do much more than he has any right to do.The cgi aging is done well too.Those who comment on Harrison shouid revisit their attitudes when they approach 80 years of age.This fine is a fine addition.It's not the embarrment I expected.Harrison plays his part with the respect and attention I expect from a man of his calibre.Even at age 80 he's more of a film star than the majority of young actors around today.They should learn from him as shouid those who disparage him.This film doesn't try and turn back time.It actually respects time and age.A rarity even in so called tolerant times such as these.","6/10"
"KineticSeoul","29 November 2012","So this is a movie based on a novel, now video game movie adaptations doesn't seem to work a lot of times. But it works from novel to movies sometimes and I haven't even read the book. But it seemed like this is a great adaptation. Now I wasn't even excited for this movie or anything, when I saw the first trailer I didn't even know what this movie was about. It just showed a guy and a tiger on a boat. This kinda seemed like ""127 Hours"" and ""Castaway"" combined kinda. But it is a more meaningful movie that has some deep messages to go with it. Now this is a family movie but youngsters probably won't be entertained much by this but for the adults that like psychological and spiritual movies just might dig this one. I can't really say I was very entertained throughout this whole movie, some parts seemed a bit slow for me. But this is just one of those movies you might have to ponder upon about after seeing it to know why it's a great movie. The cinematography is just vivid and beautiful to watch even if it's mostly nature. Most of the running time is taken up while showing the relationship between Pi Patel and a tiger and they are both stranded on a boat. And I especially liked how it didn't go in a far-fetched direction but you can actually buy into the relationship between Pi and the tiger. Overall this is a great movie that is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of action or laugh out loud comedy. Although there are some witty and cute comedic parts in this movie. Without giving the ending away it leaves it up to the audience to choose. Although some might like the message and other won't.8.2/10","7/10"
"kiomarsnu","18 February 2023","I really enjoyed watching this movie. Post Endgame this is the first MCU movie that has a good story, action, drama and a lot of weird aliens - I hope Marvel makes movies about the events in quantum realm. Honestly I had high hopes for Wakanda Forever BUT I couldn't watch 2/3 of it. Half way I was so bored that I had to leave. Quantumania wastes no time and immediately gets into the actual story and action. The jokes are a bit flat, but they don't ruin the experience. I think this is one of the best Ant-man and Wasp movies, and I can't wait to watch it again on Disney plus platform when it is available for streaming.","7/10"

"kjames-26542","14 August 2018","This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.","1/10"
"kjkbhill","3 July 2023","I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan and Harrison Ford is a legend. But this movie didn't do him or the franchise any Justice. The CGI was terrible, in true Disney fashion. I don't see how they can't figure it out. It seems to be a trend with Disney now. They keep pushing out tons of movies and the special effects continue to get worse. The storyline was lacking and it was entirely too long. This wasn't the Indiana Jones we all loved. I used to think Crystal Skull was the worst Indy movie but now I'm leaning towards this one. The last Indiana Jones in my book is The Last Crusade. You can't go wrong with Sean Connery as his dad. That's how I will remember Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.","7/10"
"kjproulx","12 January 2024","By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out.","7/10"
"kjproulx","4 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse surprised the hell out of me back in 2018. Not only was I shocked at how entertaining it was, but also how well-crafted the story was. So, of course, I was eagerly awaiting the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Well, it's now playing in theatres and I'm honestly still trying to process it all. I'm not sure if words will be able to truly explain how much I loved this movie, but let's give it a go.After the events of the previous instalment left the multiverse wide open for exploring, we pick up right where we leave off, sort of. The film opens with a bit of Gwen's backstory and then dives into the family dynamic of Miles Morales' story once again, which will always be a highlight of these movies for me. Visited by Gwen, Miles decides to enter the multiverse again, but this time the stakes are far higher and certain revelations send this story in a whole new direction. I couldn't believe my eyes and what was visually being told, especially in certain moments. As a Spider-Man fan, I was grinning like a kid from ear to ear. It also gets much darker by the end which really surprised me for a film aimed at a younger audience.Even more than the first film, the animation here tells the story just as much as the dialogue. Each world had its own unique visual style and it seamlessly blended together after my eyes adjusted. At first I found all the animation styles jarring, but then I ended up thinking it was masterfully done. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen and it's seriously a work of art to look at and experience. I'm absolutely blown away by the look of this film.On top of the incredible animation, this story is just far deeper and richer than the first and is more mature as well. This is a film made for adults, with a child-like look to it. The scenes that both pay homage to the past while moving this story forward were inspired and I can't wait to see where they help the story further even more. This was a true theatrical experience I won't forget for a while. Yes, the animation is amazing and the story is incredibly well thought out, but if it wasn't for the screenplay this film wouldn't have also had the emotional impact.Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Dave Callaham are a team that know exactly what they're doing here. I have full faith that the third film that closes out this trilogy will be just as good, simply because this film is very close to perfection for the story it was telling and I loved the first film too. Other than needing to adjust to the style a bit more than the first, I had zero complaints here and I haven't been able to say that about a movie in a while. If you can go along with the crazy visual style, I seriously can't recommend it enough. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now playing in theatres and I think I have a new favourite Spider-Man movie, as a well as it currently being my favourite movie so far in 2023. It's truly spectacular in every conceivable way, especially for the type of film it is.","10/10"
"kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate.","6/10"
"koki400","6 March 2014","I must say that this movie has one of the worst endings I have ever seen. It was all a dream or the evil character is all in my head ain't got nothing on this movie. I am not trolling I will say that life of pi is beautifully shot and it is moving at times. However, Spoiler alert...the basic structure of this movie is ""narrator"" at the beginning ""let me tell you a story that is so fantastical you wont believe it."" Viewer at the end ""Oh my, did that really happen...I...I..don't believe it."" Narrator ""I told you..the reason you don't believe it.,is cause I made the whole thing up."" We then are treated to the real story which is suppose to be so terrible that he made up this ""loose"" story about animals which is some vague metaphor of the truth blah blah. The real insulting part is when the old codger ask the writer...which story do you prefer. The premise, plot, and ending of both stories are the same but do you like the one with the cuddly zoo animals or the one where we use people as bait and I watch my mother get killed. The writer and the audience in unison say...tear rolling down cheek..the one with the tiger...the end. The point being some pseudo intellectual notion that watching your mother die or being raped or insert whatever horrible thing could happen to you is all a mindset or how we choose to deal with it. OK I get it, a positive attitude can do wonders. But seriously if you survive something like the holocaust I would rather just hear the version that is the truth rather than the version where Adolf Hitler is mickey mouse and you were in Narnia the whole time. I mean come on..this is so insulting on so many different levels. First off, if you are going to tell me this stupid made up story abut honey badgers and unicorns..then stick to it like a crazy person...don't tell me the real story right afterwords. Cause you know what my reaction is going to be, not oh my god what a cute story I like the first one better. My reaction is going to be oh crap you watched your mother get hacked to pieces and you made up a story about it involving zoo animals and then you ask me isn't the first story better...um yes it is...but the story of Anne frank would be better if she was cat woman and died at the end fighting crime...but alas that's not what happened..nor is it the story I prefer.","10/10"

There was times I yelled out something I can not say on here from anger. There was times I felt redemption. It's kind of like watching game of thrones.

It's not a perfect movie but keeps you following Jason character, Jeremy Irons is wasted, sad he is very good actor they didn't give him better lines or things to do. The hunger games actor is good to his character is horrible human he plays it well. I'm glad Jason did this after the Meg 2 and the other movie with Stallone that were terrible he needed to come back with something good! Honestly the subject of this movie is very true and sometimes I wish there were beekeepers in real life.","9/10"
"kopec_chavez","3 July 2023","I love Harrison and I love Indy and it's insult to him and this movies (except the last one with aliens) to end it like this! It was a mess and yes I believe that they change the ending 7 times! The director isn't cut for this movies!Harrison is 80 and they man try very hard to work with what they give him!The music amazing but the rest ... but the worse is Phoebe she just ruins it for me (remember the last James Bond?) her character was insufferable at the end they make her a tinny more like Ake cause she supposed to be the next start of this movies but it was tooooo late!To change Indy personally I know he was mourning his sons death (way to get around no more Shia) but Indy Jones is amazing charismatic positive and not a drunk that no one respects him???? Why ? Cause Disney has to ruin Amazing characters !If your not a fan you will be fine but if you love Indiana Jones it will be very difficult to stand 2 hours and 30 minutes of this insult!","2/10"
"kosmasp","12 September 2017","Don't expect to see full on war .. it's more Guerilla War tactics and all that. Also it's war on many fronts and it's more of a road movie in war times. Now for a movie to work you need a really strong villain. And Woody Harrelson has that charisma to pull it off. He also has a very memorable scene very early on to justify that status and solidify him in that more than evil role.Unfortunately this cannot be sustained throughout. Still while he may lose some of his drive and certain predictable things happen, there is a lot of Drama and a lot of Action happening to keep you on the edge of your seat. The effects get better with every movie of course. And overall the new PotA movies do justice to the legacy of the old ones, who surely will look outdated to some.","3/10"
"kosmasp","13 January 2024","... as honey! But vicious! Because of protecting the hive and all that. So no pun(s) intended! Actually if you are open for it, there are a few puns or information bits about bees you can learn ... or at least hear. Bees are important - unlike some humans - at least according to the movie. That said: suspension of disbelief is quite important with this one.I do believe that John Wick is the better movie (franchise), but it's not like there can only be one. There is also a sense that the movie has a bigger universe ... if this is successful I do believe that we can and will see a lot more of Statham and others. Just saying - be aware what this is and what you want to watch. It is nice to see something from David Ayer ... he serves us something quite violent! Though it is not like there are complex choreography ... there is viciousness there for sure though!! The first action highlight of the year is here ... enjoy.","8/10"
"kosmasp","2 May 2015","I haven't read the novel this is based on, so I can't really compare the book with the finished movie. But I can say that the movie takes you on a journey. Something that has to be seen to be believed. Also one of the better 3D movies out there. This may rely on it's special effects, but never stirs away from the human story/emotion it tries (and successfully) conveys.It's also not too sugarcoated, showing animals like they are and not a cute version of them. Of course one could argue that maybe it's not the animals, but ... well if you've seen the movie, you know you can put a different layer on it and it works great. You can either enjoy the beautiful scenery and nice pace or see this as more ... it can be inspiring if you're in the mood for it ...","10/10"
"kosmasp","3 June 2023","No puns intended - and yes it is plural! So many things that are touched upon .. same is true for the movie. There is so much, that watching this once is not enough. While it has been a while since I saw the first (or rather previous) movie, it is not entirely necessary to have seen it. On the other hand, you will have some callbacks, if you have seen it. Maybe even more if you watch them back to back.The character are well drawn (no pun here, not an entirely intended one at least) - and talking of drawn: I remember that the first movie had one style throughout the movie. This combines many styles (and universes/worlds) ... which suits the movie well. You have so many characters (some returning, but also quite a few new ones) .. and you have the old ones ""evolving"" to a degree. Still stuck - still trying to handle their situation, still struggling with having a ""normal"" life and being the superhero their city deserves (well let's assume that is the case).Cameos are here - and this is all over the place (ok that can be found guilty of being a pun) - we get references of so many things. Me not being as familiar as other when it comes to Spiderman comics ... I assume there are even more in jokes here that I was not able to comprehend or even detect. Twists are here to stay and the trailer did not really give away too much - so no finger pointing (I had to - as did the movie).Dialog is great - and quite fast paced! It does not leave you with room to breathe ... but it is tight and it works. And it also is helping that the voice cast is as good as one can imagine. The multiverse is here to stay - or you know switch around, fighting the good fight ... what I did not know: the movie is only part of a larger story ... so do not be surprised if the movie leaves you wanting more at the end ... to quote the movie: to be continued (thankfully the sequel is coming next year)","10/10"
"kosmasp","7 May 2019","I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection","2/10"
"kratoslncool","27 October 2017","I truly feel the pain inside me when I see so many negative review about this movie on IMDb. Growing up watching the 2nd remake (2001, and all of them are bull dung), and later on watch the original (the original are masterpieces), now I find this trilogy amazing. People complain there is no ""war"". Oh cmon, this is not like call of duty war, or Destiny war, this is evolution war, this is mental war. It is serious on so many level that the movie doesn't talk about war is just people shoot people, people shoot apes or apes shoot ape, this is the movie about mental pain (ceaser's family is killed), PTSD (ceaser keeps seeing the ghost of Koba), and metal fight (ceaser keeps fighting back his own will of revenge). This movie is touchy on so many level and the more I watch it, the more I feel fascinating about how the director can put so many content in just like 2h of watching. Truly masterpiece, in my opinion, this movie deserve 7/10 for some rush action and plot hole, but I have vowed to give any ape movie 9/10 so here you go. Stop hating and start loving the monkey.","8/10"

"krisssannn","5 June 2023","Only downside to this film is I have to wait until the next film to see what happens next. Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse checks every box. We see that Miles has grown in many ways but is still figuring out who he is. We learn more about Gwen and her background and how that connects her to Miles. I connected to their characters and related to their experiences. We also are introduced to new versions of Spiderman throughout the spider-verse and each character brings more delight.Overall the animation remains ahead of the game and is thrilling to see on the big screen. I love how the story built upon the foundation set by Into the Spider-verse without feeling boring. I honestly didn't want this film to end.","9/10"
"krzysiektom","16 June 2023","I'm on the fence about it. Split into two scores. One is very, very high: the music score and soundtrack. Amazing! 10 out of 10 for me. The other score is weak: the movie itself. I find the story , direction, animation and the voices very mediocre. For children mostly. The script is very predictable, yet confusing at the same time. The amazing music score kept my attention till the end, were it not for the music I suspect I'd be bored. I'm not a fan of comics in general and I'm not a child. Only 2 out of 10 for me. So, I add the score of 10 and the score of 2, and divide it in half. I give the movie 6 stars.","5/10"

One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it .

"kunalkhandwala","12 December 2012","For years, a best-selling novel was deemed to be non-filmable due to its sheer scale of fantasy involving a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck. Until a visionary film-maker adapted every element and enriched it with today's latest computer-generated imagery to give us yet another masterpiece. In what could be one of the best adaptations of a fantasy novel, director Ang Lee celebrates with the modernity of cinema to tell a compelling tale that captivates one's imagination. Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi' is brilliantly visualized while maintaining a powerful narrative in spiritual and emotional harmony. The writer (Rafe Spall) meets Piscine Patel (Irrfan Khan) in the charming backdrop of Pondicherry where he inquires about Piscine's origins. In a most natural manner, Khan narrates his childhood and upbringing, including the origins of his eccentric name, how it evolved to 'Pi', his religious explorations and his father's principles. ]The writer then inquires about the most interesting part of Pi's life. In the tumultuous period of emergency that was declared in India, Pi's father decides to move to Canada while selling off all their animals from the zoo they managed.They set sail on the Tsimtsum with its kind Buddhist sailor and brash cook. Woken by a thunderstorm, Pi's initial enthusiasm about it is soon turned into a nightmare as the ship begins to capsize and he is left stranded on a boat, watching the vessel take his family down into the ocean with it. Pi has no time to react to such tragedy in the storm as soon enough, he realizes that he isn't alone on the lifeboat. While the Hyena kills off the zebra and orangutan, the Tiger named Richard Parker (clerical error at the Zoo) overcomes the vile creature and becomes the King of the boat. Pi's struggle to survive off the boat, safely distant from Richard Parker poses emotional, logistical and mental challenges. Below that surface level though, we witness Pi's determination to get rescued, his will to keep the tiger alive to give purpose to his own existence and his mental strength that made him resourceful in every circumstance. Spiritually, Pi suffers it all and through hunger, pain, fear, dejection and eventually determination, he sees the work of God in everything around him. Yet, Ang Lee's version does not dive deep into the spiritual realm. Nor does it portray the extreme harshness of being stranded in the middle of the Pacific ocean. The film's strength is in its tender moments of silence between Pi and Richard Parker as they witness the different tides together. Ang Lee chose to overpower the viewer by immersing into the sea of visual artistry rather than have a debate over God and food on a boat; And it worked.Ang Lee has most effectively used three elements to dazzle the viewer. Water, light and life. Never before has the ocean looked so daunting, rough, dark, transparent and serene, all in one movie. Through Pi's rigorous struggle to survive storms, we witness the ocean take on a ferocious form which is captured in a spectacular manner by Claudio Miranda. Then we witness the beautiful marine life in tranquil waters that are phosphorescent (the whale shot was phenomenal) and the serene waters when the Tiger and Pi are simply staring into the depths of the ocean. Then of course, the CGI of the animals and especially that of the Bengal Tiger. Someone would have to tell you that it wasn't real. That's how good the CGI work on Richard Parker was and every expression, reaction and movement was very real-like. A refinement that we had last witnessed in 'The Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. The hyena, the millions of meerkats on the carnivorous island and the flying fish were equally stunning creations. In the midst of all this, there were some beautiful 3D elements that were dancing and moving on the screen which gave us a sense of 'Avatar'. Overall, the film is a must watch in 3D because there is just so much creativity that sets a benchmark for future productions that indulge in fantasies. Irrfan Khan is just splendid. His narrative comes so naturally as though it was his personal story. The narrative is so finely balanced between fact and allegory and Khan never gives you a chance to choose one over the other, thus leaving an Inception kind of ending to ponder over. Adil Hussain was impressive as Pi's father with a versatile performance whereas Tabu did not have a role that would challenge her by any means. Andrea Di Stefano as the priest who introduces Pi to the son of God was remarkable in a cameo. But the film is heavily dependent on Suraj Sharma to carry the various emotions that a survivor of a shipwreck would have to exhibit in various circumstances at sea. Suraj easily relates to Pi's trauma upon being stranded, his desperation to live, his fear of the Tiger, his anger with the Tiger, his determination to survive, his despair at losing hope and his regaining of hope. His is one of the finest debut performances we have seen in a very long time and the credit goes to Ang Lee and David Magee's screenplay for extracting such brilliance from him.""Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed,"" Pi tells himself, ""but with God's will he can be trained."" Ang Lee refrains from being preachy about Pi's religious sentiments in a storm or in solitude. Instead, he highlights the face of humanity in adversity. He touches upon various religions but the importance of having one is seldom the focus. The older Pi may have narrated the story of him and the Tiger to the writer to make him believe in God but the audience is never driven to it. Spirituality lingers in the background, never being direct. Perhaps that subtlety is the reason Life of Pi is such a universally enjoyable film. 8.85 on a scale of 1-10.","9/10"
"kuner-59029","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism.","2/10"

I was looking forward to this new installment but very disappointing that it was a long movie without an ending.Suddenly, in the last 20 minutes, when the energy was going up to a 10, from an 8, and more and more complexity was being introduced.. I knew it. I can't believe they are doing it to animated movies now ('cartoons'). Why is the movie not feeling like I will have the itch scratched. 'to be continued..' .. knew it!!Not cool to do that, especially when they introduced more and more open loops. To do it with animated movies now?

Animation was innovative and spectacular, script was whip smart and clever as hell, character development surpassed most live-action films, and there were twists and turns all along the way.What made the first so great was built upon in this movie, but they did it in a smart, thoughtful way.

"kylebelcher","8 June 2023","Either this movie is getting it's score bumped up by bot accounts, or I watched a ""mid"" version from another dimension.I'm honestly baffled by all reviews that I've seen for this movie. It's far from a masterpiece, but the critics who are speaking out against the film are seemingly doing so for clicks. Filling their ""review"" with zingers and half backed complaints about the movies undoubtedly fantastic art direction and animation.This movie falls flat when it comes to pacing and plot. The first half of the movie had me engaged, despite drawn out character moments (which are arguably needed, I'd just argue they could flow better and cut down on runtime) and the fact that we don't see Miles get pulled into the main plotline until a round half way through the film had me loosing some interest admittedly. This was something reviewers took into account for other films, like the first of The Hobbit trilogy, so why does this film get a pass?I was definitely ready to check out when we got to the scene on the bridge in Mumbai and Gwen was the only one to get an alert about a breach in the ""cannon"". How we can we blame Miles or Gwen for doing a sloppy job when the writing is sloppier? Why didn't anyone else present on the bridge get an alert? Why didn't Pavitr know about this cannon event like everyone else? When it's heavily insinuated that all of the Spider-Men/woman working for Miguel know about all of this stuff and are actively working to avoid a multiversal doomsday event.","9/10"

"l_rawjalaurence","14 July 2013","LIFE OF PI is quite simply a visual feast of spectacle. From the Indian locations of Pondicherry in the past, to the sequences taking place at sea, a quite wonderful evocation of an uninhabited island where the plants are predatory, to the final sequence taking place in sunlit suburbia in Canada, the film is full of memorable images. The moments involving the animals - especially Richard Parker the tiger - are equally memorable; if they have been created using CGI, they certainly did not seem so. Director Ang Lee has a wonderful way of suggesting the animal's predatory nature, yet at the same time its straightforwardness (unlike the human characters). At the same time, I have to admit that the plot of LIFE OF PI is slight, to say the least: one can understand the central character's desire to discover himself and his relationship to God, but the progress of moving towards self-awareness is sometimes a slow one. The film drags on occasions; one wishes that more character- conflict had been introduced, especially involving Gérard Depardieu, who has a memorable cameo as an obstreperous ship's cook.","8/10"
"l-r-patrick","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are
better than the original creators which they are not by any means!For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research
and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the
fans before the random cinema goers?Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing
there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.
The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!5/10 but should have been an easy 10.","9/10"
"Laakbaar","29 December 2012","I found this to be a beautiful, enigmatic and meaningful movie. In the end, the cinematography is what stands out for me. The landscape and village in India, the vividness of the shipwreck, the scenes of the ocean (and the wondrous things that occur there) and the algae island -- it was all quite beautiful.Ang Lee also did a fantastic job in showing how the main premise of the book (i.e. a boy stuck on a life boat with a tiger) could actually work. I simply couldn't buy into this metaphor until Lee showed it to me on film.It's astonishing how lifelike the computer-generated tiger was. The whole movie hinged on this. It worked brilliantly.How many of the beautiful images were real? It's so well done that I really do not know. It's possible that most of the movie was computer generated. A cartoon, essentially. If so, it was technically brilliant, but it leaves me wondering about the film going experience. What did I just see exactly? Related to that are my reservations about the realism of the ocean scenes. Beautiful, yes, but do such things actually happen on the ocean? I'm still not sure. I'd like to know.What was the religious message of the movie? We are told that it delivers a profound message, but I'm afraid I couldn't really get it from the movie itself. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but should a movie have the effect of making you scurry to the internet to find out what it means? The metaphors here were too complicated.I suspect this movie might speak more to the faithful, or at least to people whose minds are still open to faith. I'm afraid I'm on the same side as appa and amma, and this movie did not convince me otherwise. This is a movie with a profound message, but it's a message I didn't quite get and I think I reject, the artistry notwithstanding.I have to add that, although I am easily moved, this film did not move me. It did not really evoke an emotional reaction in me (apart from wonder at the beauty). That's the main reason for my score. On this point the movie failed for me. Perhaps I need to see it again, but I didn't empathise with the main character (either the younger or older versions). I'm not sure why though.To me, the twist at the end complicated the movie enormously and raised disturbing issues. Yes, I would have preferred to see the movie about a tiger rather than the alternative, but how on earth does that relate to religion? I'm sorry, but I didn't get it. Yes, faith and your particular religion are choices, but so is the decision to reject faith and religion as superstition. And I long ago rejected the notion that the grandeur of nature, or the beauty of art, is proof of God's existence. That is nonsense.To be honest with you, if Ang Lee had filmed the alternative version in the same beautiful way, perhaps that would have been a good movie too. I might have preferred a more realistic horror-adventure film. Or is there some rule of cinematography that a movie like that would have to be ugly because of its theme? There is beauty in evil too.But I write this review as someone who has not read the book, so what do I know.","9/10"
"LadiesMan315","27 April 2019","This will go down as the best Marvel movie ever created. During the first hour it's like a pick up of where they left off in Infinity War, it's like shattered glass you don't even know where to start to put pieces back together,2nd hour it starts to get fun and exciting and it's like this is what we came here to do and we better make it worth it, bc we only have one shot.The last hour are the moments everyone has been waiting for, and the last final battle scene is the best action scene ever made. The people who made it deserve some type of an award for making something from a comic and putting it onto the big screen, I'm not even overrating it. All you heard in the theater was sniffles, it was absolutely breathtaking.SPOILER* (Do not continue reading if you don't want to know this)
Only negative OPINION I have is the Fact that Hulk was a total waste of character they definitely could've used him ALOT more. MCU has made hulk a JOKE. He didn't even fight. They need to just cancel his character, his character was a huge disappointment like really.","10/10"
"ladyliliroche","17 February 2023","I already dont have much expectation coming into this movie. We bought a standard ticket (ie not imax or xtremescreen), day 1 in Australia. The cinema was pretty empty (though it is probably due to the time too. We catch the movie quiet early. Before dinner time basically.)There was only this 1 person that laugh at the jokes and kinda seem to enjoy the movie.This movie basically lower my IQ and kinda spit in the face of science.Lots of magical bubbly word of Quantum, subatomic etc being thrown around to sound smart as they were explaining it. The whole thing doesnt make sense.First of all, why is there a civilization in a quantum realm? Bacteria / amoeba is not a human like civilization. How are they even there? Kang do not even create them since Kang took their area... apparently.And if there is a civilization... why is Janet is alone? WHY IS SHE ALONE FOR 30 YEARS? And kept saying SHE WAS ALONE FOR 30 YEARS WHEN SHE BASICALLY HAS INTERACTION WITH BILL MURRAY (fine if she wanna keep her relationship secret with her husband but this is ruining her trauma and hardship in the first movie).The whole trope of ""I don't want to explain it"" and ""we dont have time to explain it"" gets tiring fast.And the script was lacking!! One of my iffy point is when Bill Murray;s character do not recognize the word human but use the word people!? Like hello?From the beginning, I was already confused on how people actually breath when they go to quantum realm, since oxygen molecule would be larger than their bodies, but anyway, I can live with that disbelief but a whole civilization? With a whole metal cities and electricity?I kinda think they went through some rewrite and forgot bits and pieces. There was a scene towards the end where Janet got captured by Kang and the next scene lead with Janet being escorted by the guards to face Kang who was sitting in his throne. Did Janet went to the toilet or something and that is why she had to be escorted back by the guards?And why is Chidi (the mind reading guy who is also from the good place - my fave show) is even there? AND WHY WAS HE ABLE TO READ A SENTIENT MIND? JUST WHY IS THERE A WHOLE CIVILIZATION THERE?There was a lot of star wars influence and looks for some reason. If only they basically went through another multiverse instead of saying this whole quantum realm where it was basically nonsense. Kang's palace could be inside some burnable rubbish for all we care.Paul rudd is paul rudd. A delight and I like watching him. I kinda want to watch clueless now. Cassie was alright. Funny that they recast her but I didn;t even know until I check the web for some info.There was a teaser for Loki too (the show that disappoint me fully). Tom looks good and young. Owen wilson is there too. Exciting... maybe... if only Marvel start hiring better writer and stop writing bad movies.Last note - since Kang couldnt recreate the Pym particles, it means Hank is smarter than him. Screw those advance technology. Multiverse travelling, emotions driving... cant even do Pymu;s particle. Should have studied other universe's scientist more.Hopefully Guardians would be a good and fun movie but I am sure done with expectation... was hoping the movie end fast. Two hours felt really long. There was some boring shot too during exposition. The headshot with actor right in the middle as they are explaining, just standing still... boring...","7/10"
"lakings97","6 March 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the third movie of the series with all the original cast members returning to this film. I would have to say this was the worst movie of the three that Marvel has created. In this movie the team is accidentally transported to the Quantum Realm where they encounter strange creatures and life that exist as small as the atom. The theme of Freedom comes back around towards a group of alien type creatures that are oppressed by the evil empire led by Kang who is played by Jonathan Majors. The storyline had a Star Wars feel to it, where the empire is trying to rule the galaxy and much is the same in the quantum realm. I think it was silly and couldn't take it seriously. Bill Murray had a cameo and Kathryn Newton played the older Cassie Lang. Overall it was an ok movie that I couldn't care for.","7/10"
"LaLaLandSucks","15 July 2017","This movie was beyond boring. It was also very pretentious. There were so many plot holes in this film. Way more plot holes than Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The cinematography was very mediocre. It's the same bland, darkly lit look from the previous Dawn of the Planet of the Apes film. Camera placement wasn't very good and it had no use of the quadrant system when it came to framing either. The CGI is probably the best it's ever been, but it's nothing special. It's just a bunch of talking apes riding horses and shooting machine guns with one arm. The direction had no style, it had weak action sequences that were very stupid with very little inventive camera work. The OST composed by Michael Giacchino might be one of the most laziest OST I have ever heard. It tries to be deep and biblical, but it just ends up being laughable. This is one of the worst films of the year and probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Highly overrated.0/10.","3/10"

"lallolu","1 February 2024","This is the best action film I have seen for some time. It has a truly relatable scamming story and the action parts are more realistic than i have seen in many action films. Maybe the one part that may not be too realistic is the number of bad guys this guys gets through. But that is not even done in exagerated way. Everything seems plausible.I am so elated by this film that I even mustered the time and engagement to write a review. That leads to a slightly unrelated issue, which is why is IMDB forcing one to write 500 words review. I stopped writing review since it was introduced because I am not going to be forced to write essays for every film I would like to review. 200 words would be more realistic. Common IMDB!","10/10"
"lancequan2046","27 November 2012","A sad, violent and cruel story disguised as a fairy tale about a kid taming a tiger at sea. In Ang Lee's hands the book-to-film adaptation was thankfully not turned into something of a young Robinson Crusoe or a love story between a volleyball and a fat Hanks. At the same time none of the magical realism ""feel"" of the novel was lost in the adaptation / visual interpretation. Eventually the very bloody message of the story (humans are essentially beasts, we create religion or hallucinate about faith to help ourselves forgetting our bestial nature) was impressively preserved without the need to show almost any gore. Most importantly, the very sensitive topic of the conflicts and dependency of faith, religions, science and nature was beautifully narrated in the movie. The technicality demonstrated in Life Of Pi is everything on a magnificent, grandeur scale, yet at the same time the technicality does not over-shine Lee's nature as an intellectual – his yearning and pursuit for purity and beauty.I remember coming across a film review that called Lee's Life Of Pi ""preachy"", which seems to echo quite a few reviews on the book. Whoever said that, in my opinion, made a very basic mistake in understanding the purpose of the story. Both Martel's novel and Magee's script, not only never attempted to coax people to flock to religion or faith, but also put a rather nasty joke on religion and its forms. Yet at the same time in the end the protagonist of the story was able to maintain his faith, despite having some not-so-mild-natured joke cast onto his religions. ""Preachy""? Please. This looks more like a sacrilegious story to me.When I read the book, one of the things that impressed me the most was that Pi never for once cursed, sworn or truly lost it while drifting at sea, amidst all his suffering and misery. My guess is that reverence and hope never really left him, and that, is probably the true distinction between having a faith and not having one. Lee gave this rare, controlled and optimistic narration a beautiful stretch in his film – Pi had a happy ending by textbook definition. In the end, some might think of Lee as some semi-delusional intellect with wishful thinking, he is probably more willing to believe in the deity and beauty in human nature instead of looking into our bestial instincts. Or maybe, he is like the Indian girl in the film dancing Bharatanatyam – there is a blossoming lotus flower hidden somewhere in his heart.I am far more pessimistic than he is. I am constantly on guard in case my Richard Parker ambushes me and tears me into pieces, although I also know, there is probably still a lotus flower hidden somewhere in my heart.","1/10"
"LansTaylor","6 June 2023","First and foremost, 'Across the Spider-Verse' features animation that is nothing short of spectacular. It pushes the envelope by combining diverse artistic mediums and methods to provide a feast for the eyes. Each frame is a piece of art, with incredible attention to detail, vivid colors, and exciting action scenes. It is simply amazing to see the degree of imagination and skill on show. All the props to the animation team, you guys deserve the inevitable Oscars to coming your way!The plot itself is extremely interesting how it explores new realities and introduces intriguing Spider-Man varieties while diving deeper into the multiverse theory that was previously established in the first film. It was exciting to see established heroes and newcomers, each with special abilities and personalities all come together. The dialogue is witty, and heartfelt, and shows a genuine understanding of what makes Spider-Man such a relatable character.This sequel is a complete accomplishment that serves as a monument to the power of narrative and the virtually endless potential of animation. It's a movie that will speak to viewers of all ages and have a lasting impact. When the ending card appeared, I couldn't believe it had already been over two hours. I'm glad I didn't see spoilers to what the ending card revealed because I could've sat there for another two hours if possible.","10/10"
"laplante-co-672-297856","15 August 2023","The cons:The opening set piece did a good job of recapturing the aesthetic of the original series. CGI Indy was visually impressive, but for the odd uncanny valley glimpse here and there. More notably though, it didn't feature the visual and scripted gags that were a hallmark of Spielberg's first trilogy. It's almost business-like in the way that it sets up the rest of the movie.Like Crystal Skull, this adventure is rooted more in science fiction than classic archeology. The time travel gimmick just did not work for me. Time travel movies always create paradoxes that can't be resolved... or they create more questions than they answer. This one is no different. Does the dial create the rifts or just find them? Indy informs Voller that Archimedes' didn't know about continental drift, therefore the rift they are headed for will not take them to 1939. But, in a too-wild-to-believe coincidence, the continental drift error takes them to Archimedes himself. What is the probability of that, especially considering that neither Voller or Indy take into consideration the vast movements of the earth around the sun and the movement of the entire solar system through the galaxy? Archimedes himself would not have known about these celestial movements at all so the calibration of his Dial should have been even more wildly inaccurate.There is a huge cloud of melancholy that hangs over Indy in his senior years. Loved ones have died, or moved away. He's living in a squalid apartment, falling asleep in front of his TV night after night. His accomplishments in past adventures -- including as a spy(!) as we learned in Kingdom -- have not earned him any sort of recognition or interest from either the public or the government.The action sequences are missing the tension was drawn out in the early movies in similar scenes? Remember the very first movie? In the first ten minutes, we saw Indy barely outrun a boulder, pull at his whip frantically to get himself out of the hole and under the closing stone gate, race across fields with arrows and blow guns at his back... Who can forget that fight between Indy and the huge German as an out of control airplane slowly circles around them? The chase scenes and such in this movie are competent, but never generate that level of ""OMIGOD!-will-he- make-it-in-time?"" that we saw in the original movies.The pros:The death of Mutt Jones. I expected that there would be a throwaway line about how Indy and Marion's son was off living his own life and adventures as a way to explain his absence. Instead, the character is effectively used to provide context to Indy's weary attitude, and to explain the absence of Marion.The return of Marion. We all wanted Indy to finish up on a positive note. After a movie and a sequence where we get sad and depressed Indy, the movie comes full circle (again) for both of these characters.Helena. I actually liked the prickly relationship between Indy and Helena. I thought it was justified very well, and it evolved organically into the mutual admiration and affection that we eventually see. That said, I don't see a need to continue the series... or a spin-off series... with this character. The Indy series ends in the 60s, well past the time of the earlier trilogy, which were a tribute to pulp novels and cliffhanger serial movies. The producers will never be able to recapture the spirit of those earlier movies.","6/10"

Andy Serkis has come along way across the series from infancy in 'Rise', to the dual protagonist of 'Dawn', to the full-on lead character of 'War'and his character had grown, and his motion captured performance is truly remarkable. He's the crown jewel of this franchise and he leads the charge from beginning to end this time around. I also have to make room for Steve Zahn's performance as a newly introduced ape, who is about the closest thing to a comic relief this film gets and his comic timing and tender eccentricity allows some breathing room between all the doom and gloom","1/10"
"larrymeers","17 July 2017","Before i saw this movie i looked at some people's opinions about it and i saw mostly negative reviews, so i was really nervous going into this movie thinking that i would have had the same reaction to it and seriously i have no idea what those people are talking about. So War for the planet of the apes is the 3rd film in the new prequel/Reboot of the planet of the apes movies. And this is about Caeser going on a journey to stop a war between his apes and an army of highly trained soldiers, while he also tries to control his more violent instincts. First the obvious, the CGI is amazing and is truly a technological marvel to cinema. Andy Serkis once again plays the ape ruler Caesar and is easily the best movie character in recent years, in each film he has gotten progressively better and in this one it is definitely the best performance. The story is great and is well acted throughout. This movie is also an amazing drama. There are a lot of moments that just make you jerk a tear every once in a while and its believable. The action sequences are pretty good too. Woody Harrelson plays the colonel and he does a pretty good job at it (He is not as good as koba but still good). He is just a character that you can relate to and you understand why he is doing all of this. Caesar and the colonel are pretty relatable. As much as i would love to say how great this movie is, i better stop right here. I loved every part of this movie and i did not find anything i did not like about it, but i am gonna talk about why i think most people were disappointed with this film. So if you watched all the trailers and looked at the title you may be expecting one thing, a ton of apes and humans fighting with guns and rockets. But although there is some of that in this movie, its definitely not the main point of it. This movie to its core is about the war that a person faces emotionally while war is happening around him. We see this concept with Caesar all the way through the movie. It also talks about what terrible things a person or people would do in a war. Woody Harrelson's character does what he does because he believes that the entire human race is going to go extinct if he does not act. I mean, would you do that if you knew that you could slowly be replaced by another species? So some people do not like this film because they were expecting a full on hardcore war movie. And it is that, but it really is a commentary about how a person has a war within themselves when war is happening around them. And people either missed, did not care, or did not understand the more darker themes about this movie. But anyway, in the end i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every way it could have been. It has amazing CGI, performances, action sequences, dark themes, tear jerking moments, and a beautiful moral to it. A+ or 10/10 APES TOGETHER STRONG!","10/10"

This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying.

"lasttimeisaw","11 March 2013","I cannot overpower my very own purist's paranoia, I watched this film in theater a few days earlier in dubbed Italian (my Italian level is so-so), I could not reckon that any film has been officially ""viewed"" until I have watched it in its original form, so thanks to the latest BluRay copy, finally I am able to hail LIFE OF PI as my current favorite film of 2012! Although the film literally is the biggest Oscar winner this year (4 wins out of 11 nominations) and Ang Lee now is up among the pre-eminent echelon of a multi-times BEST DIRECTOR winner, the unfulfilled appreciation (from the prim Academy) still seethes inside, the BEST PICTURE/BEST DIRECTOR division has stuck Ang Lee and his teams twice is unprecedentedly jaundiced. Back to the film itself, I am pretty oblivious to Yann Martel's source novel, but Ang Lee and his crew has deserved every single accolade because the outcome is simply astounding and mind-blowing, from the exotic Indian zoo, the palette of liveliness and quietude seeps directly to viewer's mind curves, then, the visual stunts take over, the minutiae are constructed into an inconceivable kaleidoscope of sea survival (ship-wrecking, heaven-like sea surface, carnivore island).The allegorical storyline which can be laconically recapitulated as ""the story between a boy and a Bengal tiger floating on the sea"", also goes beyond one's mundane imagination, the liaison between Pi and Richard Parker the tiger has gone through a minute incubation-to- transition cliffhanger (technically it is not a cliffhanger since we all know the ending beforehand, but the two-hander just conjures magic spell upon us, which is mesmerizing, eye-popping and heart-warming), with the brilliant first-time actor Suraj Sharma interacting viscerally with the green screen (an almost entirely CGI-germinated tiger heralds the auspicious retirement of all the animal cast, as long as money continues investing, leave those poor animals in peace and so are the ever-engaging animal activist). Both Suraj and Irrfan Khan (the adult Pi) deserve more recognition from their meticulous and soul-searching performances. Being an agnostic, Pi's eclectic belief in all disparate religions doesn't register enough contention to me, and also it is claimed to be ""a story could make one believe in God"", the film is marvelous in keeping its ambivalence so determined that either of the interpretation could find its recipients piously and without arousing any palpable repulsion even we all know how parochial people could react as far as ""religions""is concerned. The film is a flawless eye-candy and soul-remedy, multiple viewings are highly- recommended, it is a conscientious masterstroke to corroborate Ang Lee's versatility in mastering his universe of filmmaking (no genre boundary at all), commixed his oriental philosophy with western first-class craftsmanship and esprit de corps, Ang Lee can swagger further on the path of a true auteur, not only among his peers, even for a holistic view in the film history, his trail can be indelible.","9/10"
"latinfineart","16 January 2024","The film started out quite well and the very first action scene was excellent, though it was a bit of an exaggeration, however with a fairly minor leap of faith it was somewhat believable. From there it just went downhill, there was that Hollywood tendency to over blow everything and to stretch every premise to the absolute limit of implausibility, which just gets old after a while. You just you want to see some good action, you want to see a good story and you don't want to see a story stretched to the absolute end of what is physically possible in the known universe. However, if you like Marvel type films, silly stories made for kids, or cartoons, you will likely enjoy this drivel.After about 45 minutes, the film got very tiresome. I also thought the female FBI agent (Lampman) was very poorly miscast, and written, and the South African bad guy was just a ridiculous cartoon.It could have been a decent movie but it wasn't.","6/10"

I didn't even see the film in 3D and I was still amazed by the magical scenes created. They felt like you could actually be there, experiencing them as Pi is. Another reason I really enjoyed this movie was because of how deeply it digs into and explores the heart and soul of the character of Pi. This amazing young actor does a great job of portraying the raw emotions of one trapped at sea. It is believable, entertaining, and understandable all at the same time. Its almost like a character study wrapped up with a visually spectacular adventure. It is one of the must-see movies of 2012.

The movie's visuals have to be seen to be believed.Ang Lee had already had some impressive achievements with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"", and he continues with this movie. It is just not a movie that I can describe. The one scene that was a little weird was when Gérard Depardieu appeared as the cook (a big name in a small role interfered with the movie's plot).

"leekeithf","9 September 2023","Absolute cracker of a film! Forget that it's animated, it is a film and first rate at that. The animation is out of this world, the music amazing, the story top notch and script superb. It's not often you get everything just right, but this surpasses getting it right; it's an amazing film. Even the Brit-Punk Spiderman, they got it spot on. The humour is also good and pitched at the right level, even having an apt joke about the villain talking about holes. The characters were well thought out, the dialogue was appropriate and well written. In fact, my son & I cannot criticise any of it. It's on par with the Christopher Nolan Batman films. If they could apply this level to something like DC's Injustice it would be brill. I am so glad I watched it and it's part of a 3 piece story, not just a sequel because it will make money. The story is coherent and sound and the level of research that has gone into getting it right has worked. I cannot praise it enough.","10/10"
"leelacade","15 July 2017","This has to be humanity's low point. Not the movie, the people giving it glowing reviews. What a mindless crowd of 'bots parroting paid commercial hype about something that has NO STORY, NO WAR and NO PURPOSE other than making money off of total morons. The way people mindlessly react to marketing cues like trained poodles is disturbing in the extreme. Could be useful as a first date movie or a new friend that you're not really sure about. Anyone that thinks this is a great movie is not worth associating with beyond what it takes for you to drive them home after the movie.It's almost like English panto. The play isn't funny, everyone knows what will happen, and the audience reacts on cue with as stereotypical dialogue as the actors. Seriously, targeted at gen Y? Have millennials actually been raised to react like little 'bots to particular commercial stimuli? I fear so, for there is no other reason that someone would rave about this kind of big budget, Hollyweird CRAP!And they need to be sued. The screen writing is so lazy as to be non- existent, and when they do come up with a character...it's a complete rip-off of Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. I can just hear the banter among the makers of this one. ""Uh...he's a total rip-off of Kurtz."" ""Yeah, but just stick a goatee on him and it'll be OK"".And did I mention that it was boring to the point of torture? Slow? It's stops more often than a school bus, whilst running twice as slow. Even if you're totally marketing addled and wouldn't mind this, you will mind what you pay to see it. It's simply not worth it at any price. Free. If it were free and you're mindless...maybe.

I just kept hearing the Itchy and Scratchy theme song throughout this kill-fest: they fight and bite, they fight and bite and fight. Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite, bite, The Beekeeper. And were all the people in this unit also bee helpers? What if one of them wanted to have an ant farm? Would that be OK?Seriously, how old should you be before you grow out of these ridiculous combat movies where one man takes on an army? 12? 13 tops. If there is no possibility of a bullet or even a fist striking the hero, then all of the action is devoid of tension. If there is no tension, just fast-forward to the end credits and save yourself a lot of time. The Equalizer, John Wick, and the films of Jason Statham are not entertainment fit for adults.There were some horrific performances and huge casting gaffs in this. Jeremy Irons simply cannot do an American accent. Period. He sounded like he had a speech impediment. The FBI woman was morbidly obese, yet wore a Harvard Track & Field t-shirt. Was that supposed to be ironic?The movie shows why no one should have a gun in their home. More folks die from their own hands than intruders.","1/10"
"Lemony_Fresh203","25 March 2020","My favourite film ever that ends my favourite trilogy ever. I've seen it 3 times in the past 3 years.
I cried the last time I watched it and the time before. Most importantly, I cried the first time. I cried in the cinema lobby. I cried in the toilets. I cried on the way home. I cried while scoffing down chips and cried myself to sleep.
Watch this film for the love of God. It was the first time I cried in the cinema and the only time I've ever cried that much. If someone (me) can have such a connection to Caesar than this is a film worth watching for everyone.","9/10"
"Leofwine_draca","11 May 2014","When I heard that the film adaptation of LIFE OF PI was being released, I made sure to go and read the novel beforehand so I could compare it to the movie. I'm not a huge fan of Ang Lee and his overrated CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this. But I needn't have worried; this is a great movie, a film that fully explores the splendour of cinema and on-screen storytelling, and a film that's better than the book.The early and, quite frankly, boring parts of the novel are summarised well so that the storytelling is always on the move. The focus is on the survival narrative, which is as it should be, and the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker is brought to vivid and moving life. Sure, there are the occasional mis-steps along the way, like an ill-advised and tacked-on romance, but for the most part they get it right. The CGI is wondrous, especially the animals and an eye-popping shipwreck, and the story is moving, tender in places and full of heart. I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes in parts, and it's all down to Richard Parker, who must go down as one of the great animal characters in cinema. A great example of filming the unfilmable.","9/10"
"Leofwine_draca","2 March 2020","So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages.","10/10"
"Leofwine_draca","27 May 2020","WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the third of this lacklustre trilogy of revamps and hopefully the last. You're better off sticking with the originals, because the only thing good about these films is the calibre of the special effects; unsurprisingly they're better than ever this time around, and you don't question any of the simians for a moment. Sadly, the trade-off comes in the sloppy writing and random focusing on silly sentimentality, with the momentum often grinding to a halt to deliver one excruciating tear-jerking moment after another. It's silly and embarrassing, sitting ill at ease with the pantomime action found elsewhere in the movie.","8/10"
"Leofwine_draca","29 December 2019","So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","9/10"
"leonffe","15 February 2023","This was really good. The humor was toned down a bit from the previous movie. The movie could've been bit shorter, by cutting some scenes which show the scale of the army and revolution.I liked Cassie's actress much more in this movie than in Endgame. She seemed much more similar to the young girl from earlier movies. Having million weird characters was quite funny.They decided to make modok into this weird blob of uncanny valley. Though I liked that it brought end to the Yellow Jacket's story line. He also worked as an excellent comic relief.I noticed some similarities to Attack of the clones in some battle scenes and scenes that introduced the Kang's army.","7/10"
"leonidasoriginal","17 July 2017","Great movie, showing that franchises can have a good continuation. Went to see this movie last night. Bought some big-ass popcorn and took my lady to a cinema to see this new ""apes stuff"". Little did we know she'll cry a bit at some parts, and I'll act like some sh*t fell into my eye just to keep all man-the-f-up vibe going on. OK, seriously now. This is well produced, well-made and quite emotional movie. From beginning to the end, it has well-balanced pace. Emotions, such as anger, sadness, joy etc. are not exaggerated and the viewer can get a good feeling about the entire situation, which makes this movie very enjoyable and watchable. Cesar is well developed as a character and you can compare him to a real person. He has sort of Denzel Washington vibe in my personal opinion, tho played by amazing Andy Serkis (do understand this is meant entirely as personality traits with deep respect to Mr. Washington as a person and actor.) Woody Harrelson does his part well. He is kind of an actor that comes into the picture, you never expect something big from him, but he always delivers his part and does it great. (Having 2012 in my mind for example).I do miss more of a backstory for some other characters. How, why etc. but that would make movie 5 hours long.CGI is well made, believable, the action is also well produced, well paced and there is this funny, goofy ape, played by excellent Steve Zahn, that brings just enough fun into the otherwise somewhat sad story, balancing the entire atmosphere.Most of all, I honestly think that director is a person than deeply condemns society and all we do in terms of war, destruction and everything humanity does. We are violent, self-important with complete disregard to consequences of our deeds. This is not ""save the monkeys"" babbling, but more of a rhetoric question ""why are we such a violent species?""I'm probably shooting far, but I see this movie it as a critique of the whole of humanity.Glad I saw this at the cinema.","2/10"
"LeonLouisRicci","13 April 2013","Visually stimulating but hardly Spiritually uplifting this Film tries so hard to be Philosophically relevant that it drowns in its own excessive pretensions. Especially after the Revelation. What is meant to be an Epiphany is more like an Exorcism.It pulls so hard at the Soul that it is a painful extraction of belief and Faith. A watering down of deep convictions and hopeful beliefs. The message here is not well grounded and is left floating about meandering every which way and is so heavy handed that it can be a detriment to its own determined thesis. Undeniably stunning at times it is the disjointed editing and the completely cop out ending coupled with the thick Theology that keeps this from being completely successful in the way of The Way. There is simply so much shallowness to the Script that it is barely saved by the expanse and the exciting vistas. Probably better enjoyed if you let go and take the voyage with as little intellect as possible and nary a search for Enlightenment.","10/10"

"lepetitdj","5 June 2023","OK, this is not so original to say that this animation flick is a masterpiece. There must be several other users that say the same thing as I am saying.But the reason is simple: it's because it truly is!This movie left me overexcited for the last one of the trilogy. I felt like a little boy that had the best chocolate on the planet and was told that there will be more of it if I can wait until the next batch is ready. The animation is tip-top, the characters are deep and likeable, the story is fresh (relatively to the multi-verse mania that has been running the theaters lately), the action scenes are over the top and easy to follow, the epicness of the situation is increasing as the movie goes and many jokes are really funny (sometimes simple but they work in their simplicity because you let yourself go with the general mood of the film).Spiderman fans will have what they are looking for and newcomers will just have an insane experience of colors, beauty, action and emotions that very few movies are able to give, with a real message and deep thoughts about the multi-verse, destiny/determinism, family and responsibilities.So, dare I say it: this is the best movie of 2023 so far, the best animation movie of all time and one of the best films of all time, period. Just go watch it!","9/10"
"lesleyharris30","15 August 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a largely engrossing film from beginning to end as we follow these group of apes on another adventure leading up to the events of the first Planet of the Apes movie. The stakes are risen even further once again as Caesar is put up against a group of army soldiers that puts their very existence at risk. This film had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and is without a doubt one of the most groundbreaking franchises in Hollywood at the moment.I will admit that it did not grab me as much as Rise or Dawn did, it was a lot slower, taking a lot of time to develop these characters and the new world they are living in, which is fine, but there comes a stage where we would like some action. As well as that, the majority of the movie takes place in one location, and not an exceptionally broad or interesting one, I was getting cabin fever just watching after awhile, I wanted to see these characters move elsewhere. I have absolutely no gripes with the cast here. Woody Harrelson exceeded my expectations as the Colonel, an absolutely gripping, condescending and layered villain that we love to hate. Of course, Andy Serkis hits it out of the park once again as Caesar, it never gets tiring to see him in this part. The amount of depth and vulnerability he puts in to this character is amazing, and the characters arc in this film in particular is heart breaking. An action packed, gripping movie. Proving that you can get the gold three times in a row, War for the Planet of the Apes is a must watch for fans of the series, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. Caesar and the rest of the apes are put in great danger when a ruthless army colonel and his men try to wipe them out. Best Performance: Andy Serkis","10/10"
"lesunra","8 July 2023","It's everywhere in entertainment now and it's irredeemably cheap in terms of storytelling and its underlining mission; tearing down the past to remake it into something it never was to 1. Apologize for it. 2. Try to change it to suit modern nonsense, I mean sensibilities, 3. Cash in, of course. The flaw in this action every time is the people most responsible for these newer movies DID NOT INVENT THE ORIGINAL PREMISE. If you do not create it, do you care about it? Do you respect it? Does it mean anything to you besides just another job? Certainly not, at least not compared to something you created yourself.What's here is the identical formula we've seen in Star Wars sequels, that Obi-Wan mini series and unrelated to Disney, Doctor Who. A discrediting of established characters, ignorance of their past and motivations (Indiana Jones the grave robber??? Accused of that by a female Beloc clone that we're supposed to like even idolize as the hero? Jones was all about putting those things in museums so that the ACTUAL grave robbers didn't take them for profit! They were coming for those relics anyway.)Like the two other Disney products I mentioned, the established heroes are presented as weak, inferior broken down shadows of their former selves. The reasons are different in each case but that's the formula. A younger bland super human by comparison, (typically a woman) swoops in saves the day for these broken down old white men and everyone still breathing lives happily ever after. That seems like the mission statement that is now costing these companies millions because audiences don't like their established heroes being portrayed as weak, inferior broken down old white men. Even if they are old white men, give them SOME dignity at least afterall, Indiana Jones IS the title character, not Fleabag and her sidekick afterbirth or something.Generally, that's the formula but I've read that the initially planned ending for this was going to be Indiana Jones time traveling back, dying, and Helena being the real one on those adventures in the earlier movies in the series. Chibnall basically did as much to Doctor Who. The fan revolt was real enough to cause a major shakeup in an attempt to keep that series afloat.People hated Crystal Skull for various reasons, personally I hated the CGI the most. Those bugs, the vines, the monkeys, the aliens. All of the locations look fake. Filming might've been entirely studio bound with CGI backdrops. CGI is no better in this movie. It's worse if you consider how technology was meant to advance over 15 years time. Over reliance on CGI is always a mistake and they make that mistake constantly. CGI doesn't seem to save money either so why not give it up for a change?The overlong chase scenes lead to desensitization regarding them and that makes them boring instead of exciting and I mean really really boring. That's something good filmmakers understood to avoid years ago. Maybe if they had a thin script like this that lacks some major elements in storytelling, they wouldn't do any better and wind up falling back on chase scenes as filler. Maybe that's why this Indiana Jones movie is a half hour longer than all the others but feels like it has half the story they had. Yes, that makes for a boring movie. You're supposed to not notice how boring because of the visuals and sound serving to jar you awake instead of keeping you engaged in the plot. Have I mentioned yet how cheap that is in terms of storytelling? Let me restate that.Main characters must first be likable and their adversaries interesting. Mads Mikkelsen barely manages the interesting part (its nothing particulary new for him to do acting wise and that makes his role here cliché) but there is nothing likable about the real star of this movie, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. When she isn't cringe trying to deliver a joke, she's a 20 something snob who looks down on everyone who in reality would know far more than her if only because they have more experience than she does. In Raiders of the Lost Ark they established Indiana Jones right in the first act as an experienced adventurer who also is a knowledgeable professor, not as someone with a pasty face a few years removed from college. Her having this fount of knowledge that dwarfs everyone else is more fake than time travel.In Helena, we see the most frustrating thing about this movie because of the missed opportunity her character represents. There is several ways someone can be a hero. Indiana Jones from the start is a sad, embittered, broken old man; instead of this new character introduced into the series helping him find his sense of purpose again (that can be a form of heroic action btw) as they both go on this quest, Helena never does it and Jones ends up much the way he began but with a happy ending that isn't very believable nor does he seem to deserve because the hero's journey never happened for him. He is basically the same when it's over. His story arc is flat as a board, Helena's story arc is flat as a board. She already knows and does everything. There is no growth anywhere for anyone. She barely manages a level of tolerance for the title character and that's it. Remember Last Crusade? Indiana Jones had no relationship with his father at the start, not too interested in where he was living, nor what he was doing until he is told his father is missing; it ends with a common understanding between them as they are united in ways they never were before. Does a journey like that happen in Dial of Destiny? NO. Even Crystal Skull didn't make Dial of Destiny's mistake of ignoring the monomyth which certainly makes Crystal Skull a better movie despite the CGI. At the start of Crystal Skull, all the main characters are in one stage of their lives and their lives dramatically change over the course of the story and are completely different by the conclusion of the quest. Does this happen in Dial of Destiny? NO. I'd give Crystal Skull 4/10 which means it's bad but it at least showed characters growing as the story leads to a resolution. Which character learned anything major about themselves when this thing ends?Time travel is no more ridiculous than aliens but not a better idea than them either. You'd think since this was set during the height of the cold war and space race and arms race and all that, Soviets would be the logical adversaries again like in Crystal Skull and not random Nazis who couldn't have the resources on hand (even with covert help) to try and acquire such a thing certainly not compared to a superpower's direct involvement. That's not believable.The fan service is horrible pandering which is just trying to make something indigestible digestible. Clearly this is the least successful movie of the series so audiences aren't content with these little condescending nods to the past anymore. Pandering didn't make Jaws 4 into a better movie, did it?The suspension of disbelief is stretched further than seeing that guy's face melt in Raiders or that other guy aging to death in seconds after drinking a sip of water in Last Crusade. At least something unexplainable causes that. The suspension of disbelief here is simply plot holes and violations of basic physics that do not have some supernatural power making it seem possible. First noticed near the end of the de-aged Indy opening. How the Nazi chasing him doesn't become decapitated on the top of the train moving that fast is beyond reason or logic. The sound of the impact was too loud to be anything other than a beheading but no? Also beyond reason or logic is how a woman weighing no more than 130 lbs can hang on to a plane traveling 250 mph with a 200 lb man hanging on to her. There was nothing supernatural preventing her from being blown out of there immediately even without the guy clinging to her, and yet.... There's also examples of villains seemingly warping into locations, or being conveniently dumb to further the plot. I haven't gotten to some teenage boy magically figuring out how to fly a plane almost immediately yet. Such things can be excused a few times but an entire movie? Come on now. Do better, please.....People wanting to like this will labor to make it seem good in their minds; the people who don't will correctly think they shouldn't have to make an effort to like something that is supposed to be entertaining in its own right.I continue to wait for the day when these franchises created by others years ago are left alone and the allegedly brilliant people coming up with new garbage like this start creating THEIR OWN NEW FRANCHISES! SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT!!Friendly Reminder, if you never subject yourselves to forays into the destruction of cinematic heroes, they're not canon TO YOU. If you prefer thinking this ends in '38 with riding off into the sunset, you'd be better off for it. Not everything needs to be viewed through the scope of studio greed. You can easily imagine better content than they provide. THAT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO DO, TRUST ME.","6/10"
"lethalweapon","6 January 2013","The tale of Pi Patel, an Indian boy who grew up in a zoo in Pondicherry. The movie is shown as narrated to an author interested in penning his adventures. The main focus is on Pi's incredible journey from India, where he lost his parents and older brother in a violent storm. They were headed towards Canada to sell off their animals and start a new life, but a horrific storm wiped out the entire crew. Pi is stranded alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named 'Richard Parker'.The core of the story is how Pi manages to co-exist with Richard Parker in the harsh environment of the Pacific, with limited supplies, no help in sight, and unpredictable weather. The movie is an artistic delight. Fantastic visuals (The best use of 3D visuals since Avatar), amazing storytelling, good plot-line, and compelling camera-work. The narration was largely visual. With only one human survivor, the story couldn't be pulled through conversations. I expected a voice-over accompaniment throughout the movie, which would have been the easy way out. However, it went without the voice-over, like the 2000 movie Castaway - and this allowed the audience to drink in the vast emptiness and loneliness that perseveres through the movie.The story was interesting, but straightforward. This is possibly why the twist at the end of the story took me completely by surprise. I won't give out spoilers, but a subtle twist that leaves something ambiguous puts an entirely different shade to the whole experience. And that escalates the story from a good one to a truly excellent one.","8/10"
"lewatsfilm","11 January 2024","The story revolves around a notorious secret agent codenamed ""The Beekeeper"" (Jason Statham) living a peaceful life. However, his past catches up with him when his close friend is murdered. Driven by revenge, Clay must take on the dangerous secret organization he once left behind and uncover a high-level conspiracy.The Beekeeper is a solid action experience that combines strengths and weaknesses worth considering. The action presented in the movie does steal the show, although some viewers may wish for more suspense and violence (gory/bloodier) than what is shown.In terms of plot, some viewers may feel that the main character Clay (played by Jason Statham) is often lucky. While this is common in action movies, some viewers may feel that it makes the storyline too predictable.But in the end, it still offers an enjoyable experience at the movies, being a good choice for those looking for entertainment without too much critical analysis.","7/10"
"Lewis_Heather787","17 July 2017","It is very rare for a franchise to improve with every new instalment, rise was a good start and base to launch of from. Dawn upped the stakes and consequences for both the apes and the humans, ending with a very good cliffhanger. So going into war the creators had a rather nice but pressure situation with creating this film with audience expectations. So how did the conclusion fair?Firstly lets start with the director of the film Matt Reeves, who step into the franchise when directing Dawn of the planet of the apes, which was a very good accomplishment. Once again he has triumphed with another stellar film in the franchise, improving on certain areas and keeping the core elements we love the same. He has managed to finely balance the film with great action and intense intimate scenes between main characters. The struggle between the two main stories and conflicts of the film, which both are very understandable the human side and apes. The directing compliments both the huge action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film and the journey of Caesar and the apes to find the ""human zoo"". Beautiful shots and set pieces from start to finish.Another area of the film that Reeves excels in is the screenplay of the film which also really well written, a brilliant mix of seriousness and emotion for both the apes and the humans. There is a good focus on the struggle for Caesar which is dwindling away from Dawn and his focus for revenge on the family tragedy that happens. Reeves is so good in writing family troubles and tragedies, for his next film reeves should look for a character with these elements to them....oh wait!!!! The script felt natural with good wit and charm but can easily flip to serious in places for the situations that both the humans and the apes are in. Due to this great screen writing the audience can really resonate with both sides of the story once again both for the humans and the apes struggle in the world after the simian flu. The acting in the film just like the other films is really good again and a brilliant central performance from Andy Serkis, who is complimented very well by Woody Harrelson. These are the two stars of the film however the rest of the cast are not far behind them because everyone in the film is really good it is just this two are slightly above the rest. Serkis shows a new dynamic to the character of Caesar and the journey that he has been on from the first film, he shows a damaged and aged character really well. Woody Harrelson is really good in the film as the main human voice in the film, even though he is not a nice guy you, as the audience, can understand his positioned to a certain degree. He does have some good points however his desperation and fear of death and destruction has made his delusional and is his ultimate demise. Maurice once again is the calming voice in the film for Caesar and is still a fan favourite with some really good comedy moments with bad ape. Talking of bad ape he is really good as the comedic relief in the film which is balanced really well in the film, it could have become a laughing stock and boring, however this film judged it really well. The final character to mention is the one with no lines and that is nova, she is a really good and emotional character even though she has no lines in the film, really interesting character. The CGI of the film is some of the best that has been put to screen in recent times, it is seamless and truly outstanding. It definitely deserves some recognition during awards season at the end of the year, there are times in the film where you forget that the apes and motion capture. Another area that is the final positive of the film is the score which compliments the film really well. Michael Giacchino does really well with the score complimenting the scenes in the film heightens tension when needed and can be mesmerising at times.Finally the negatives of the film, there are very few and involves the ending of the film. The ending of the film is a little obvious for the film but however I can see why they needed to do it to complete the trilogy and the story of the characters. All in all the is film is 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, A really good film, with fantastic directing and story telling with breath taking visuals it is a must see in the cinema. A great conclusion to a brilliant trilogy of films, one of the best trilogies ever.","1/10"
"Lewis_Heather787","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","1/10"
"lex131","30 January 2024","I'm sorry for this great actor that better projects are not coming his way.This movie is just lazy bad. Bad scripting, bad camera, bad dialog, bad actors, bad everything. Even the fights were lazy bad. Even the one liners are bad.I liked ""Safe"" from Jason Statham and many other movies, this one doesn't even come close.Save yourself the trouble, watch paint dry. There's a lot more logic and entertainment in that.I'm so glad my wife stopped me from paying cinema tickets for this and instead I waited for it to appear online, then I would've really been mean on this review.I really hope he gets better scripts before he gets too old because I really like Jason Statham and his style of action.","2/10"

"lhbaker-28783","1 July 2023","Honestly, he's one of the best villains in the MCU and in this movie he absolutely carries. This movie probably would've been my least favorite MCU movie without him. In fact, I was kind of rooting for him, something I've never done in any movie. Everything else but the comedy (which is quite underrated on IMDb) was absolutely horrible. Especially M. O. N. O. K. Or Derek. Any part that he's in pains me. I wish he wasn't a part of this movie. Most of the Quantumania people are forgettable too, but there are some good ones. The CGI is iffy in some spots but for the rest of the movie it's alright. Overall, Quantumania was half really good and half cheesy that I only recommend if you don't absolutely hate Phase 4 MCU.","6/10"
"Likes_Ninjas90","23 December 2012","Based on the 2001 novel by Yann Martel, Life of Pi is the metaphysical and spiritual journey of a character who must question their physical endurance and willingness to sustain their faith in God. This character is named Pi Patel and we first see him in present day Canada as a man (played by Irrfan Khan) who is preparing to tell an amazing story to a writer (Rafe Spall). Pi's story begins at a young age when he is a schoolboy in India. His parents are strict but intelligent and run a zoo with a huge array of animals. The film traces Pi's life to when he is a young man (Suraj Sharma), who is reluctant to join his parents once they sell the zoo and move overseas. Once onboard a Japanese ship transporting the zoo animals to be sold, a huge storm floods the vessel and Pi is separated from his family. He finds himself in a lifeboat with a zebra and somehow survives the storm. A fantasy adventure of imagination begins, where several other animals emerge from under the covers of the lifeboat, including a tiger. Fearful of the tiger, Pi resorts to building himself a mini raft attached to the boat. He must use a survival guide and other skills to control the tiger and retake the lifeboat. Director Ang Lee has never made the same film twice. His constant versatility and creative mind for unique visual spaces defines his work. His films including Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain each adopted a unique filmic style appropriate to the material. Only someone with such diverse and sophisticated formal knowledge like Lee could have made Life of Pi work as well as it does. Once deemed unfilmable, the film's visual sophistication bridges the gap between an art house project and mainstream blockbuster. Its stunning visual qualities do not stand isolated but provide cinematic representations of complex philosophical questions surrounding myths, religion and faith. In lesser hands this might have been a more bloated, less intelligent film. Before Lee, the project was passed between several directors including Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Alfonso Cuaron and M. Night Shyamalan, all of whom are considered visual stylists. Lee's personal strength as a filmmaker is that he rarely allows images to be devoid of meaning. His approach to this complex material is wholly cinematic: he challenges the audience to draw meaning from the properties of the screen and the images, realising a film that is in equal parts dazzling, thoughtful and ambiguous. The only stumbling points are the early scenes where Lee deters from his cinematic approach. The jumble of anecdotes, including Pi being named after a swimming pool, are confused and estranged from the rest of the film. But the screenplay by David Magee finds its footing once it adopts a linear structure to tell Pi's life story. Expositional dialogue is skilfully masked as provocative philosophical statements, which are then attached to the film's Biblical imagery. The film's midsection, spent almost exclusively on the raft with the animals, visualises Pi's desolated world and draws parallels to stories like Noah's Ark. The animals in these scenes are a powerful example of Lee's emphasis on combing theme and image. Early in the film Pi shows great interest in the tiger. But his father says to him: ""When you look into its eyes, you see only your own emotions reflected back at you"". This statement is problematised by the displacement of the animals on the raft. Are the animals real or part of Pi's imagination? The animals, I think, reflect Pi's shifting emotional states. When Pi is afraid, the tiger shows more aggression. When he learns to tame the animal, it shows more control. These images are also allegories for God's own existence. If one fears God, like Pi fears the dominance of the tiger, doesn't that project our own vision of God in our minds? The basis of the film is therefore how much faith we are willing to place into something that might only be a state of mind. Using a number of aesthetic devices, the film makes a dazzling case for the power of imagination and visual stylisation over conventional naturalism. Colour desaturation is used purposely, with the white tones of Pi's clothes stressing his desire for a cleansing experience on the boat but perhaps also to show impending death given the unlikelihood of his survival. The tiger's half of the boat is coloured red. It matches the colour of tiger to instigate a place of fear that Pi must overcome. Lee also allows his camera to be unconstricted by reality. The fluidity and tilting movements of the camera are used to stunning effect in a storm sequence that takes on Biblical and apocalyptic proportions. There are gentler moments of great power too, where Lee opts to take us deep under the ocean, delivering some of the most striking images in cinema. Abstract and impressionistic images, like a sea of blue neon lights under the ocean, are enhanced spectacularly by bursts of colour and unintrusive 3D effects. To define precisely what these scenes mean, and many others including a bizarre episode involve thousands of fish and an island of meerkats, would be futile. The film isn't concerned with facts, logic or realism. It stresses how stories and myths inspire our survival as a species. Posing a belated question about what type of stories we would rather hear, inspiring fantasy or scientific rationale like the survival of the fittest, is clever because the answer is predetermined by the amazing things we've already seen. There's a small end moment where the film undermines its sophisticated ambiguity by explaining a twist too neatly but minor quibbles never deter from the power of Lee's craftsmanship. Life of Pi has the spectacle of a blockbuster but compliments its flair with heart and intelligence - compelling reasons see this astonishing film on the big screen.","2/10"

"lindsayripley-66335","13 January 2024","Too many grievances to list... save your time and your money... it's very, very, very bad. Multiple very bad fight scenes and the acting could not be worse. Jason Stratham is significantly better in The Meg, which says a lot in and of itself, and he looks old and slow in this movie. The fight scenes are egregious and completely unrealistic, but at least they are back to back with very minimal dialogue in between. The names on the marquis are great, Jeremy irons, Jason Stratham, Felicia Rashad, all brought to shake with this show. The story line might be the worst part and continues to hammer home the bee theme. All of it is just plain terrible.","1/10"

Starring Paul Rudd,Evangeline Lily,Michelle Pfieffer,Michael Douglas Kathryn Newton and Jonathan Mayors, the movie follows Scott Lang(Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne(Lily) who are dragged into the Quantum Realm, along with Hope's parents Dr Hank Pye(Douglas) and his wife Janet(Pfieffer) and Scott's daughter Cassie(played by Newton this time).Together they must try and find a way to escape the realm before they are trapped there forever.Is Hope's mother Janet hiding somwthing about this world ,and who is the mysterious Kang(Mayors)?Overall it wasn't bad per se but it's definetly not as good as the 1st one. The movie even went through another edit in February of this year due to a poor test screening.Stay until the end credits as there is two post credits one is about black people (possible Kangs tribe)which happens before the credits appears and the other is after the credits.Could this be the last Ant Man film?

"lisafordeay","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","10/10"
"LisaLR1","16 July 2023","Recently saw the new Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Bit of a let down, although I enjoyed the bit players in the movie, Toby Jones, Mads Mikkelsen, John Rhys-Davies and fun cameo by Karen Allen. Felt the film's script was a little cheesy, too many chase scenes, movie is overly reliant on CGI and the de-aging of Harrison Ford, I felt, was distracting and didn't do the movie justice. My favorite film of the Indiana Jones franchise is still Raiders of the Lost Ark. Nothing beats the original. Dial of Destiny lacks the magic and heroics of the first film, but it does provide entertainment and a solid supporting cast.","7/10"
"listofnames","6 January 2013","I'm afraid I must have missed something about this film. And perhaps I really did but there is nothing particularly awe inspiring as you might have been led to believe. For one the grand claim about making you believe in God is never really answered. There is a quick vague nod to it at the end but for me it made no sense. The main story has nothing whatsoever to do with God. So I'm a bit puzzled on that one. There is a bit of a semi twist near the end that I didn't see coming. This reveals an extra dimension to the story that was previously hidden to us. However the impact of the twist is never really brought home in any tangible way (that is quite possibly intentional). You would have to watch the film again to appreciate the twist but like me you will probably not be bothered. The best thing about the film is the cinematography, visual effects, pi himself, young and old (both characters and both actors)and the various animals. They are sometimes cute and have their own personalities. If you like nature programmes you will enjoy it. The 3D was never spectacular but a nice extra. There are a few gorgeous looking tableau like scenes of the boat on the sea with the skyline. Visually the film looks good throughout. Pi (younger)is an interesting character. He is intelligent and has a hunger for learning. His strange obsession with gods and religions is quite annoying though (especially for an atheist like me)and seems to serves no purpose for the narrative. I think the film might be trying to say something quite profound about religion but I'm afraid it was either made too subtly or just isn't there at all. Maybe you need to read the book. The actor of the older pi is quite brilliant and very engaging. Very stoic and dignified. All in all not a bad film but please don't believe the hype! Its a sad story really but the way it ends left me kind of cold and underwhelmed.","9/10"
"littlegomo","4 February 2024","Please could the script writer of this movie find another vocation, one very far away from script writing.This could have been a good movie, but the script is flat, dull and common.

Jeremy Irons is an academy award winning actor, I guess he also has to pay the rent but to sink to this level, he must be desperate.Jason Statham has had us in stitches when paired with a funny script and decent actors and his action sequences are a thing of beauty, but in this film his character is lifeless, almost zombie-like.This is such a terrible film, I gave up half way and decided to express myself here, which I rarely do.Please be warned, if you watch this film you will have wasted one hour and forty five minutes that you will never get back.I am only rambling on because some dimwit at I M D B decided to set a rule that all reviews must contain more than six hundred characters.

"LloydBayer","12 July 2017","I made a bold statement while reviewing 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes by calling that film the evolution of cinema. And before that I called 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes a ground breaking vehicle in cinematic storytelling. Yet both films asked the same question – will xenophobia lead to the destruction of humanity? In fact, this very question was initiated as a social metaphor in the 1968 original starring Charlton Heston. Now 50 years down the line, returning director Matt Reeves has the answer, and it's a fact we've known since the beginning of civilization. Touted as the finale to an epic trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes is not your typical tent pole summer film. But it's all about computer generated apes, you say; Apes that talk in a setup that's all implausible science-fiction. Yes, and so are superhero films. And while we were sheepishly distracted by wondering which superhero character will get his/her own sequel, the Apes franchise was shaping out to be a rare Hollywood triumph in more ways than initially perceived. While Rise was a runaway hit in 2011, its story was about humanity's unintended conflict with a new race of super intelligent apes. Dawn in 2014 intensified that conflict before concluding that however hateful humans can be, peace is always an option. That little chance of peace is thrown out the window with War for the Planet of the Apes. Thus begins a visually stunning effects driven Hollywood blockbuster, and it doesn't get any better than this. Thanks to the breathtaking motion performance technology, anyone watching this film will have no doubt that the apes in this film are anything but computer generated creatures. The visuals are that good, if not the best in the franchise. Yet at the core is a strong emotional tug that transcends general expectations of a blockbuster this big. Take for instance that the terrific yet intense action scenes in this film are dispensed with controlled measure in favour of a richer and layered complexity in the storytelling. While it would have been all too easy to place apes on one side and humans on the other and light a fuse in between, Reeves concludes this trilogy with a poignant yet prophetic and equally poetic ode to humanity's self-inflected destruction. And personifying this dark heart of mankind is Woody Harrelson as a Colonel who has abandoned his ranks to exterminate apes led by our beloved Caesar. That very line, in a film pitting humans versus apes is exactly how the audience will react by rooting for another species instead of our own.Harrelson's Colonel (with more than enough homage to Marlon Brando's Col Kurtz in the still haunting Apocalypse Now) is a scary portrayal of just how ruthlessly pathological humans can be in endangering another species, or for that matter, another race of humans. While that is already known, the greatest achievement in War for the Planet of the Apes is in the innumerable social allegories that lead up to the climactic Caesar Vs Colonel showdown. It's worth the wait and the wait is not plagued with the usual bloating of a blockbuster pushing past two hours. Yet even as the story goes from grim to bleak, Steve Zhan as a chimp calling himself 'Bad Ape' injects some much needed humour. But if there is anyone who deserves top credit for this film (and the previous two), it is none other than Andy Serkis in another outstanding delivery as Caesar. No matter however accomplished, not many actors today can do what Serkis does, which is nothing short of breathing life into a digitally rendered character and then making you shed a tear over that character. While it's still a long shot in getting an Academy Award nomination for a motion capture role, what Serkis has achieved is not only colossal for this film but also for the future of cinema. That being said and irrespective of how well this film does during awards season, Serkis along with Reeves have crafted one of the most memorable films of the year. And if this is the series swan song, it is also one of the most heartbreaking and fully accomplished blockbusters of the year. All hail Caesar!","8/10"
"LloydBayer","20 December 2012","The last time director Ang Lee made a tiger crouch, he walked away with about a dozen Oscar nominations, all from just one film. This time Lee goes all the way by unleashing the dragon – this is not just a beast of a movie, it is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in everything that it sets out to be. Possibly the best adapted screenplay this year, LIFE OF PI remains true to its award winning source material by Yann Martel; at least for the most part. Just like the novel, the story plays out in three parts, starting with the introduction of Pi and how he was named after a swimming pool in France. Narrated by Irfan Khan as the older Pi, the story is set in 1970s Pondicherry, a former French colonial city in India. Born and raised a Hindu, Piscine Molitor Patel, the teenage protagonist and titular character dwells into the beliefs of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, without claiming any one religion as superior. Pi's father, a business minded zoo owner has other priorities like migrating to Canada, along with some of the exotic zoo animals for sale once they reach their destination. In a cruel twist of fate, the journey is short-lived soon after they sail into the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. Although tragic in nature, the sinking of the freighter, along with Pi's parents and elder brother, is emotionally overwhelming yet visually spellbinding as the first of many sequences Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda has in store for the audience. What follows is a fierce and fascinating tale of survival when Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with an injured zebra, a merciless hyena, an orangutan and a fearsome but majestic Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. Right from the opening credits, Lee and Miranda mesmerises us with one of the most incredible set pieces ever built for cinema. Forget what TV spots and teasers are calling this movie. Judging from what critics have to say, LIFE OF Pi is indeed an epic visualisation but not necessarily justifiable in its comparison to AVATAR. Apart from the novel use of 3D in both films, I personally can't think of any other similarity. Lee's use of 3D is not just immersive for the sake of being so; it becomes the skeletal binding to the pulsating flesh and blood of the story in such a way that I actually forgot about the 3D spectacles resting on the bridge of my nose!Thanks to David Magee's adaptation, Lee has made possible what acclaimed filmmakers have previously side-lined as impossible to film. From virtual humming birds hovering at arm's reach, to the scene when we first meet Richard Parker, to embellishing the sheer beauty of creation, Lee has broken new ground in the way cinema interprets literature. No doubt there. However, Lee's nuance as a storyteller is in bringing out the book's underlying significance of subtly suggesting the existence of God, through a relentless test of faith. This is done by two actors: Suraj Sharma as the ship-wrecked younger Pi who exalts God even in the most trying situations. The other actor is of course Irfan Khan, whose retrospect narration to a writer proves the very existence of God. For a débutant, Sharma has a large chunk of screen-time and holds the story singlehandedly with some amusing interjections. On the other hand, khan has fewer scenes but skilfully advocates the phrase that less can prove to be more.From where I'm seated, LIFE OF Pi has a sure fire lock-on for a few Oscar nominations. But the real reason this is a must-see film, preferably in 3D (I can't stress this enough), is because there is every bit of passion in its making from surreal cinematography, a soul stirring original score, to spectacular visual effects, and a phenomenal narration that only ends when you hear an inner voice that says 'Believe'.","8/10"

"lockout-59506","10 May 2022","For anyone who has been watching dragon ball since its inception you would know that the Broly story has already been done and Goku / Vegeta have already fought him durring the Z era. Reintroducing Broly as someone the Z fighters don't know is kind of weird and doesn't make much sense.Lets all be honest, Dragon Ball Z was pretty much the last good series from the dragon ball universe. GT felt rushed and more like a cash in on the popularity attempt more than anything. Everything after that was near unwatchable. I thought maybe this was going to be a remade version of the two Broly movies from the 90s into a single movie with enhanced art and was disappointed when I realized it wasnt. The only reason I gave this a shot was due to the highly rated reviews. Now that I have reread then I think most are fake. Many use the same phrase ""best dbz movie ever"" yet this isn't in the DBZ era. So either these people are bots or they dont know anything about the dragon ball series.When the saiyans first turned into SSJ in the Z series it was awesome! Here comes a legendary warrior not seen in the galaxy for thousands of years. Then another SSJ and another until it became common place and it kind of dumbed down the whole idea. Especially after they kept exceeding the level until they reached some type of God SSJ and even exceeded that.It seems as if the series is going to keep radically changing their hair color calling it a new plateau with more power but it honestly doesnt feel like more, just something different and uninteresting more than anythingAt least their keeping up with the rest of the film industry, constantly remaking or cashing in on top name franchises with mediocre to garbage film releases. I couldnt even finish this movie. There is honestly little to no story except in the first couple minutes but it never seemed to proceed. The animations were ok but nothing to write home about. Frieza sounds different and Bulma sounds different and neither in a good way. Also the fusion nonsense towads the end (when I turned it off) was all nonsense. First vegeta acts like he has no idea what fusion is or like he has ever seen the dance and then they go on to fail the fusion dance literally making the same exact mistakes trunks ans goten did during the cell saga resulting in a fat and then an ultra skinny fighter that were both useless. The level of unoriginality made my brain hurtIf you are a true fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stay away from this mess and watch some of the original dragon ball and dbz series tv shows an movies.","10/10"

"lopresti-46927","19 February 2023","The newest installment of ant man wasn't perfect but it had its good and its bad.Production value was great as it should be for a multi billion dollar franchise. But the vfx and editing was on point for sure.The characters good and the chemistry. They had an all star cast with Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Paul Rudd. Also, Johnathon Majors did a phenomenal job with Kane.The weakest part of the movie was the story. The first act was fine and moved along at a good pace but it slowed a lot in the second act. The third act was fun and action packed but the end fight didn't sit well with me. The dialogue was decent and quirky at times, but never cringe.","1/10"
"Lord_of_the_Things","29 June 2020","I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed.From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.I still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.Recommended for the fans, not anyone else","10/10"
"lordjord96","5 January 2013","Wow. Simply, Wow. 'Life of Pi' is on of those films which will always stay at the front of your mind. Every scene is so beautifully done, every theme so well interwoven. This film is exactly what I was looking for and more.The cast (albeit small) performed brilliantly. About a third of the film has more than 3 characters involved in it, while the rest is really just 2 (if you count the tiger as a character). The acting in those solitary scenes out at sea are done brilliantly. You really feel an emotional attachment to both Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's rather humorous name). Every struggle between them makes you feel scared, every pain makes you feel for them. I have never left the cinema missing every character as much as I did with Life of Pi (OK, maybe spirited away was just as heart-tugging).The plot is very well strung together. Ang Lee has tied in the themes of the book absolutely superbly. What annoys me about some films is that if they do have a meaning they try to hide it, but Life of Pi really doesn't. The meaning is related clearly to discovering God, and how we are really more animal-like than we think (it turns out the story with animals is more human than the story with humans). What also amazes me is how Ang Lee managed to put in sequences which served no purpose to the plot, just there to be purely beautiful, and get away with it! Many films annoy me when they include visually-superb sequences because they detract from the feeling of the film too much, but not this one. The fact that the entire film just looks SO GOOD means that these scenes ,made just to look good, really work. I saw this film in 3D and, despite my hatred of 3D (no film has really justified the price increase), Life of Pi actually looked great in 3D. Every scene had noticeable 3D in it. Whether this was just going further into the screen or, in many cases surprisingly, popping out of the screen, it really did work.So, #Life of Pi', is it the best film of 2012? No, but then again if it was then there must be something wrong with the world. I say that because this films' meaning is just so brilliant, so emotionally spectacular, that it just cannot be considered to be a film like any other. I actually feel bad about ranking it out of 10, but obviously I have to keep track of it somehow. Really, I would rank it as 'Pure Emotional Brilliance/10', but I'm afraid my IMDb vow prevents me from doing that. 'Life of Pi' offers a superb character ensemble, visuals which , dare I say rival those in 'Prometheus', and a plot so emotional, so perfect that it truly deserves it's 9.5/10 rating.P.S; I miss Richard Parker","9/10"
"loufalce","30 June 2023","I'll save you the time. Disney defiles everything they touch, and this is the prime example. This junk movie is exactly the mess you were expecting. The critics have spoken, and they re right. You can almost feel sorry for this mess if it were not for Phoebe Waller Bridge, possibly one of the most annoying actresses today. She tries to upstage Ford with practically ever line she utters, and she is just plain obnoxious in a very patronizing way like your left wing, trust fund cousin (fill in her name) that you can't stand. 80 year old Ford himself doesn't fare much better a a broken, boozy Indiana in his twilight years. His CGI 'de ageing' scenes early in the film have a very disturbing creepiness about them. This film was in development hell for three years and it shows. I also heard there were several reshoots too. Story has something to do with an ancient device that may offer some clues for time travel. The Nazis get hold of it and after the war, they are recruited by the US space program. All the action is predictable, the set pieces are rendered in terrible CGI, there is a horseride through a NY subway, and a rather uninspired minicab chase that seems to mirror the truck race in 'Raiders'. And to make matters worse, most of the film has a dark , gloomy color (pallor?) to it. It all looks very cheap even if it cost 300 million dollar to make. And at 2 and a half hours, its about 45 minutes longer than it should be. There is no sense of fun, joy, or excitement that made he first three installment the only ones worth watching And if Sallah can't make you smile,you know it will be a ride not worth taking. A cash grab and very undignified funeral, eulogy and burial of fine series. Speilberg, Mangold, and Lucas,shame on you! This one was so bad, it made me change my 2008 1 star rating of 'The Crystal Skull'
to 4 stars. Another 'number two' P. U. movie review from Lou.","7/10"

"Lovekrafft","3 August 2019","One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.The actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.Aside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama.","10/10"
"lowefreddy","1 February 2024","This film is a wonderful piece of nonsense with a superb cast. It's your typical guilty-pleasure action romp, with a subtle (but definitely present) social justice bent to it - even better! It exposes the evil of those call centres who prey on the vulnerable and scam innocent people out of their savings.'The Beekeeper' opens with a genuinely unsettling, uncomfortable scene where we see a good-natured, elderly woman get scammed out of her entire savings, pension scheme, and even the income of a charity she was in charge of - and this results in her committing suicide. What the scammers didn't reckon on is her typically stoic, quiet beekeeper, played by Jason Statham, who doth take no ****! He bursts in and brings down the whole edifice in typical action-film style, making it look easy of course.Walked out of the cinema feeling great.","10/10"
"lozanoderrick","12 December 2023","This movie was a clear departure from the magic that Lucas/Spielberg cast on all 4 movies, yes, even Kingdom! Since Disney took over LF, for this movie they simply hired writers that are clearly from a different generation than the ones that helmed the previous films. The writers for this movie mocked Indiana Jones, made him weak, and basically a carpet for other characters to walk all over him. Phoebe's character Helena was rude, sarcastic, and a feminist that did nothing but to further show how today's writers do not value characters such as Indy that was a strong leader that truly did things his way. The 21st century Short Round character Teddy Kumar was boring, dry, and another whipping boy for Helena to boss around.What they should have done was hire Lucas and Spielberg to direct/write the movie and even bring back Short Round to help Indy one last time to go on one last fortune and glory filled adventure. Disney as of late has truly been disrespectful to George Lucas and truly twisted the creative world he had with Star Wars and the Indiana Jones franchise. This movie was another sad reminder that today's writers are filled with an agenda to satisfy a small amount of people who will never watch or even talk about this film ever again after having watched it one time.","7/10"
"lschouder-04582","21 February 2023","I really miss the serious and grounded tone of films like Captain America: the Winter Soldier. Lately, Marvel films have been very Disney-fied. Having said that, this film was silly but still pretty good. Johnathan Majors has some really nuanced and powerful acting moments that anchor the movie. Kang is a fantastic villain that was perfectly executed. I was also surprised to find myself feeling sympathy towards MODOK. Who would've ever thought that character would translate well to film, but they pulled it off pretty decently.I also think some of the humor helped as well. I think this film should've ended differently, but all-in-all it wasn't a bad movie. However, going forward I really hope Marvel can get back to being more serious and regain the gravitas that made the Infinity saga so great.","7/10"

"Ltufano23","31 August 2023","The Ant-Man films have always been a fun, easy going section of the MCU. When all the madness is ensuing in other corners, Ant-Man is still hanging around, having a zany adventure. Here, at the start of Phase 5, Ant-Man and the Wasp defend the MCU, through the Quantum Realm. Like the rest, this installation of Ant-Man does a great job of having fun, creating emotional familial bonds, and doing fun and creative things with size. Taking place almost completely in the Quantum Realm, we see a lot of incredible visual, but also some lackluster CGI as well. It's no secret that this movie was edited last minute to make changes to its climax and I believe that is where this suffers the most. Kang was a phenomenal and truly menacing villain, but it takes away from that when he loses completely and the heroes immediately go back to everyday life. I can't help but feel that a better version of this film sits on the cutting room floor and will never see the light of day. Unfortunately, that is par for the course of some modern comic book flicks as editing has become the most nefarious villain of all.","7/10"
"lucasnmnboyd","22 July 2017","I was a huge fan of the first two re-boots. They had great character development, chemistry and personal conflicts that I could relate to, kinda, considering I'm a human. The second movie had perhaps the greatest movie moment ever; a crazed ape riding a horse, screaming and wielding two machine guns. But that movie made it work! I remember thinking to myself...THIS is why I love movies.I went into this one thinking it would follow suit and be even better than the last. Seriously disappointed. First, the good parts. Obviously, the CG is incredible. Ceaser is smarter and more badass than ever (at least in the beginning), and Andy Serkis proves that he's the master of this kind of work. Even his voice is impressive. The chemistry between he and his fellow apes is still pretty much there, he's still revered and respected, I guess. The visions of Koba were pretty cool. Aside from that...the bad parts.What I walked away thinking was that Ceaser didn't really do anything the entire movie besides deny help from his followers. He's supposed to be smarter than that. The fact that he was so determined to abandon all the apes he spent years building a relationship with just made me think less of him. That was not the Ceaser I fell in love with over the first two movies. Sure, I suppose he realized what's important by the end, but he wasn't the beast he was before. There was one good moment between he and the Colonel; after this tense scene I thought Woody Harrelson was actually going to be a good villain. After suffering through the ridiculous military decisions, cheap attempts at humor with the old ape, discount Abigail Breslin that really had no need to be there, I thought maybe we will get the kind of showdown these movies make great. What we got was this pretty well thought out sicko reduced to a bumbling mess because of a disease that was dormant in his body for fifteen years. Right then, it takes effect. What a cop out.I also thought the score was kind of weak. And I was honestly groaning at the 'single tear' cliché; there were far too many to be taken seriously. By the end, Ceaser gives up because they made it 'home'. Also seemed like a cop out. I know he isn't as young as he used to be but we have seen him take far worse punishments over these movies than an arrow. At this point I was hoping he'd see that window from his past as he died. The second one referenced the first one beautifully and I think this was their chance they didn't take.I suppose the point of the movie is to say that our conflicts are futile as nature will eventually win over everything. That's a thought provoking concept, and I appreciate the direction they were trying to take things. But think they should have kept things a bit lighter; the concentration camp feel just doesn't work with a PG-13 rating. They weren't able to take things as far as they needed to go and therefore felt kind of silly.I'm hoping they are done with these. There is nowhere to go now, and perhaps that was the point. Again, disappointment. Nowhere near the quality of the first two.","10/10"

"lucky_star_1","25 July 2017","RISE, DAWN, and WAR are a trilogy of movies in which Andy Serkis acts the hell out of every scene he is in. His emotions are on show 100% and for a CGI character, no words can express just how impressive that is. Caesar will be fondly remembered as a legendary warrior of cinema, certainly the best of his generation, and every single attribute goes towards Mr Serkis' compelling and emotional performance.The journey of Caesar is wrapped up in a beautiful way and should resonate with any human being who feels strongly about the themes of family and survival. Also, I'm truly bewildered by the number of people rating this excellent movie a ZERO on IMDb. WHAT?? Any part of the plot that you had a problem with does not discount the incredible commitment of every cast member and the level they perform that is FAR more realistic than any other movie or television show nowadays.I've read people saying ""the title 'War' is deceptive"" - NO IT IS NOT. These people need to consider the need for BALANCE. If every scene in this movie included fights and soldiers then it would be dull, cold, ineffective - exactly what viewers DON'T want. This movie accomplished something special. It wraps up the franchise without taking anything away from the first two instalments, both of which I loved, and it sets a new challenge for Caesar in which you're once again rooting for his willpower to overcome the struggle.I am thrilled to be part of a generation in which our young audiences have such an inspiring and loving character like Caesar to look up to. This film easily gets a perfect 10. Anything less is an insult. Powerful acting, powerful drama, and powerful conclusion to an amazing franchise that has done the legacy of PLANET OF THE APES extremely proud.","2/10"
"Luis_Felicio","2 July 2023","This will be the last time that Harrison Ford will appear as Indiana Jones, and I think after so many adventures it's time to hang up the hat, or not.....A truly hollywood-style movie, explosions, chases, explosions, villains, impossible scenes and lots of action, but....
The story leaves a lot to be desired.An uncreative argument with many gaps, and a lot of fiction in a story that intends to be realistic.I liked the references to other Indy films, and the appearances (in a farewell tone) of other characters from this saga.Great acting from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and a surprising new actor Ethann Isidore. 👍
Sadlly Harrison Ford shows that he his tired of the part, and you can feel that it's a stuggle till the end, to get the job done. 😥But it's just another summer blockbuster, to watch with popcorn.08/10.","8/10"
"Lursa","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","1/10"
"Luv2Spooge","31 January 2024","There's been a few really cheesy movies out about assassins, ex-cia, etc... with names like The Painter, The Bricklayer, etc.. etc... I just naturally assumed this would be another lame low budget B movie. However, this is anything but. For starter the plot is actually much more developed, Beekeeper actually means more than simply some hero's nickname.Of course a Statham film you expect a lot of awesome fight scenes and they deliver. It is like John Wick except with kicks, punches, and is actually good. I think it is especially enjoyable when the villain are a bunch of call center scam artists.The final revelation was also extremely satisfying, watching the Beekeeper enacting justice on Hunter Bid... err... I mean... Derek Danforth. I thought the mockery of the office of the president was also clever. She is a combination of Biden (awful son), Hillary (woman president), and Trump (business tycoon). I guess everyone of all political affiliation can appreciate this film.8/10.","8/10"
"Luv2Spooge","4 November 2023","I was put off by the bad reviews, which many were politically motivated especially with what Disney has been doing with their live action remakes. However, after watching it on the plane, I thought it is a pretty good film.In a nutshell, what we have here is a clean family fun film. There is no political overtone, no activists, no ""the message,"" but just good old fashion Indiana Jones.Though some complained about the female Mutt William replacement, but I thought her character was well balanced. I wouldn't even say she's a female Indiana. Her character is a combination of a lot of previous characters. She acts like Mutt, but is an archaeologist like Dr. Elsa Schiender. She has a little of Ravenwood's wildness in her too.I also think the film did a great job on Indiana. Even at his age, he was not written off as weak and helpless like Luke Skywalker or even Captain Picard. He is still action packed, but realistic in many regards. Some may noticed, he didn't fight the ""big"" bad guy as in all previous films.The weakness of the film lies in the script. At 5th installment, it has lost its luster and a lot of it is recycled and cliche. They try to compensate that with a lot of action sequences, but they failed to deliver. It was ""ok"" but none of the chase scenes or fight scenes were anywhere on par with like Mission Impossible or even Jurassic World's city chase scenes.A bit part of that is due to Disney and the film does seem to be more kid friendly and lost that ""serious"" tone. What this does is that it makes it look like the protagonist is a superhero, thus takes away the excitement of actions scenes because you know he was never really in any actual danger.But as I've said in the beginning, it is a solid family friendly movie and it has its moments. I especially like the ending, the Siege of Syracuse was amazingly done.","8/10"

"ma-cortes","15 November 2019","This War of the Planet of Apes is an intense and exciting film with great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology . The picture delivers enough energy and turns out to be an impressive flick full of fighting, action , battles and suspense . An acceptable Ape movie with huge production design in which the performers are very fine , and special mention for Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs . There concerns Caesar (masterfullly incarnated by Andy Serkis, Gollum alter-ego) , a chimpanzee who gained human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that rose to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape upheaval . As Caesar and his apes : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan , are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel . Along the way the apes suffer unimaginable losses and Caesar (Andy Serkis), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator (first outing with Will Rodman: James Franco) . Here Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and starts his own mythic quest to avenge his kind that is being submitted in slavery and apartheid . Later on , Caesar is locked and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . As simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas uprising violently every human in sight . As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) are pitted against each other in an impressive battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.This awesome film is a brilliant and intelligent sequel that contains fights , thrills , frenetic action , go riding , violence , breathtaking scenes and a strong denounce about animal mistreat . Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Recent sequel in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by the mythical film ¨Planet of Apes¨ (1968) by Franklyn J. Schaffner that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . It deals with a Chimpanzee hero called Caesar well played by Andy Serkis , this is the third film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular ending scenes when happens a fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . As Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape . The flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about vengeance , apartheid , upon origin of human being , racism , and mistreating ; though also packs action , adventures , intrigue and entertainment . Being mostly a decent follow-up of the former stories , with big moments of energy remaining throughout and it results to be , particularly , a breathtaking Sci-Fi movie full of frantic action , battles, suspense and top-notch FX by Oscarized team who made Avatar and Lord of the Rins . The performers , particularly Andy Serks and Woody Harrelson are pretty good , the characters are well drawn and in spite of excessive computer generator frames all of them are still oddly convincing . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the third live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling , self aware animal . Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Similar the previous films, this is an Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of overlong scenes in Motion Capture they are still nicely and compellingly made . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , along with Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves himself , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it's full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , Let me in , Cloverfield)
Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are as follows : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J.

"maceman1220","5 June 2023","Haven't been able to stop thinking about this since I saw it earlier today, already planning my next viewing (this time in IMAX, was only able to see it normal tonight).I had a great time with the first film. It was fresh, exciting, full of heart, and just an excellent experience. But man, as of now, this just knocks it out of the water.To start, the animation. Oh the animation. The first film was breathtaking, introduced a new style of animation that was so unique and felt so connected to the story. Now, after watching this film, it feels like my first time seeing it. The animation and how it's infused into the storytelling is on a whole other level. The use of color and so many different art styles is truly mesmerizing. To me, this feels like the first animated film I've seen to truly use the medium to the fullest extent capable.Beyond the visuals, the story and characters are just so rich. The cast is exceptional, and the focus on the human drama adds so much weight to every big moment. Every action scene hits so much harder because you care about these people and you understand why they're fighting. There's so much emotional weight carried through every moment. I especially loved the focus on Gwen. You really see so much of the film through her eyes and her story is so deep and heartbreaking.Also, beyond the emotion, the film is HILARIOUS. So many incredible jokes, visual gags, hilarious cameos. Started coughing laughing in a few scenes. Also shout-out to Hobie being one of the baddest (in the best way possible) dudes I've ever seen onscreen.Yes, it's definitely part one. It ends on a massive cliffhanger. My feelings on this film may change if the next doesn't stick the landing, but from the quality on display here, I have nothing but faith. I didn't want it to end, I could've sat through the next film immediately after this without as much as a bathroom break. I would've stayed all night in that theater.This genuinely feels like nothing I've really seen before, one of the only films I can compare it to is Everything Everywhere All At Once for shear imagination on display. It's one of the best superhero films I've seen, one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen, one of the best movies I've seen these last few years, and it's gonna be a long 9 months till part 2.","9/10"
"maclock","28 April 2018","This film was complete and utter tosh. Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie. I fell asleep repeatedly during the opening night screening in my city and I lost most interest in it after 90 minutes or so. (The run time was much too long.) While I've enjoyed quite a few of these Marvel big-screen productions in recent years, I didn't enjoy this one very much at all. Unless you're a comic book fan, I'd take a pass on this one.","2/10"
"MacReadysBeard","3 July 2023","I was hoping that this was going to correct KOCS but it fell short of the mark. Its not totally amissPositive points
Harrison Ford as Indy
Phobe Waller-Bridge as sidekick
mads mikkelsen as the main protagonist.Some old faces poping up
hints from the past movies
Setting Indy against the nazis againLess positive
The story line was weak
The bad guys were far too 2D
The De aging stuff was a bit flimsy in places.Giving Indys last story such a harsh edge
The last act between the plane taking off and
them being back in NYC , just suspending
disbelief too too far.There were shimmers of the old indy but i really think after KOCS they should have left well alone. I had maybe too high hopes for james mangold , he delivered in parts but the rest just feels very much like the cash cows tit being squeezed till it drops off and it kinda tarnishes a great cinimatic character and the reasons why they pulled em in at the box office.Unlike belloq's pocket-watch, sadly i dont think if we burried this in the sand for a thousand years it would end up being priceless.","4/10"
"macronnel","1 August 2023","This is a CGI, greenscreen heavy type of movie. I can only stand to watch for 30 minutes of this before tuning out (I was already struggling at 20 min). I understand that the setting is something of a different world, but its just nauseating, weird, tripping on acid type of strange world. I love all the actors as they are not given enough credit to use their imaginations as they interact with an empty space that is suppose to be an organism of some sort. The action scenes makes me even less invested in the movie as there is no real sense of danger. Like most super hero movies, they are very predictable. I'm sure I'm not within the target demographic of this movie and it's my fault for thinking it can be enjoyable for all ages. This is a kids movie that was intended to excite wonder and imagination so I will encourage anyone else over the age of 9 to skip this one.","3/10"
"MAD_PIGE0N","28 December 2023","I'll go shortly with the CGI, the acting and the soundtrack - this is all very good, especially Mads who is one of the best actors.The character of Helena is inadequate, her behaviour makes no sense throughout most of the movie. At some point, I wondered do I watch ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" - it was cunningly (of course) solving some hidden riddles which is kind of stupid and cliche. And in the end, the smart nazi scientist got the data wrong, but a History teacher and a thief got it right - come on! Plus, this entire nazi story is another cliche by itself - try some other villains.It is a watchable movie, kind of keeps a dose of the Indiana Jones spirit, but is nothing close to the old movies mostly because it's a modern Hollywood interpretation. The usual adventure movies with Dwayne Jonson are more exciting, at least are more creative.","7/10"
"madonaalaeddine","28 July 2017","I am astonished, truly, that a hollow movie like spider-man; homecoming that is instantly forgettable and fixated on lame themes of stupid first-world teenage angst scored better user reviews than this masterpiece. it really says a lot about the mindlessness of modern cinema audiences, especially when the main argument is that ' there isn't enough war'. that said, user reviews are moronic. Planet of the apes is a triumph, really touching and thought, provoking on so many levels. i saw it days ago and the emotion of the film is still very fresh in my mind. in fact the more it occurs to me, the richer the movie becomes. if this is not nominated in the best film Oscars category, then the Academy is as daft as so many IMDb users.","9/10"

"mags-06346","3 February 2024","The Beekeeper has a storyline that is simple, but keeps developing. It has a good vs evil plot, which can be satisfying. There are a few surprises which keep the viewer intrigued. Jason Statham is in a typical role, which he pulls off in his quiet way. There are fewer killings than the John Wick movies. If you like violent movies, this has got it. Here his skills are unrealistic, but the plot develops that sufficiently. The twists and turns keep it interesting and entertain. The movie does teach about beekeeping, so you may learn a few things. And, the bigger social issue here of taking advantage of people deserves a public conversation. So A+ to the cast and director for bringing this up.","9/10"

"mahmus","26 April 2019","Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about.","7/10"
"mahmus","4 June 2023","Bigger and more ambitious than the first one in almost every way. Bigger stakes, more and fanservice and even more Spider-men, but never at the expense of the very personal and emotional story. The character development is incredible, with Gwen's story being the easy standout for me. The movie's fairly long and it doesn't waste a single minute. It could've been five hours long and I wouldn't have complained. It will obviously leave you wanting even more.The animation is mind-blowing. As gorgeous as you'd expect from a sequel to Into The Spider-verse.I don't know how they did it, but they did it. Again. What an incredible movie.","9/10"
"majoreasy","30 April 2019","A nice production for those only interested in action sequences but not so great for those wanting closure of the Marvel story line...The best part of the film is that it brings together all previous Marvel movies to drive the plot... And the worst part of the film is it brings together all previous marvel movies to drive the plot... because it seems the production team don't really know the stories that ran before...
Anyone who follows the stories (from the movies, not the comic) will know there are much easier time points to collect each of the stones... The drama created by making this 'collection plan' much more difficult than it needed to be, added at least an unnecessary hour to the movie...Other plot points that didn't sit well with me and reduced the enjoyment of the movie, are...1) Thanos 'killed' 50% of the ""good guys"" and he's hailed as a super villain... Tony 'killed' 100% of the bad guys and he's a hero? Don't heroes learn from their own pain and sufferings and on principal refuse to inflict the same misery on others?Surely, other than Thanos and a few of his more loyal subjects, the rest are simply following orders...
(On another tangent, Thanos seems to really believe in his cause because after he killed off half the universe, including his people I believe, he lived alone and not with an army of servants and subjects for him to rule as a king... That's honourable...)2) they didn't reverse time... Just brought everyone back with a 5 year time gap... People should not behave normally when loved ones they haven't been with for 5 years suddenly reappear... Those who have survived those 5 years didn't get their memories and aging removed, right?3) how did Thanos and his gang all time travel while the avengers are so calculative about one person 2 trips?A 30 second segment showing Thanos instructing his people to mass produce the Pym solution for time travel would have closed this plot hole.4) always disliked Captain Marvel because she is so powerful that no other super heros need to exist...
And still... She is so concerned about other worlds that she couldn't be bothered to be present for the start of the biggest battle her home planet is about to face... when every known superhero showed up at the right time and right place...And later, the battle actually showed she's not all that great... So her weakness is she sweats the small stuff, can't see the big picture and not available/functional when needed?4) If they can bring back Gamora, why can't they find a timeline to bring back Natasha and even Tony? Superheros really don't like to plan and think things through... (Same as when they don't seek the easiest points to retrieve the stones... With zero time pressure for planning...)5) speaking of Gamora, the Gamora who came with Thanos don't know the guardian crew at all... so even though she's not 'evil' like the old Nabula, she wouldn't be friendly like she knows they are the 'good guys'...
Based on the time line, she doesn't even know Quill yet... So she should view him and them as the enemy in the battle...6) Nabula... If she killed her historic self, shouldn't she just drop dead in the new timeline?
Grandfather paradox anyone?7) what's with that special scene where all the women heroes joined together to show their power?
To me, that's totally sexist...Speaking for myself, I enjoy male and female superheros for their individual powers and weaknesses... Once a person reaches superhero status, in my mind, they crease to represent a gender (other than those gender/age stereotypes to generate laughs and endearment...)Having al female scene shows me that the production team are so hung up on being politically correct that they generate a reverse sexist scene to feel they are all inclusive... Sigh...
These same people want a female James Bond / Indiana Jones but not a male Mary Poppins / Eliza Doolittle... And they think the rest of the world is sexist...
The self proclaimed tolerant and inclusive are starting to paint themselves into a corner...8) while it's nice to see Bruce and the Hulk getting along...an unangry Hulk takes away what makes the Hulk a character...Remember these famous words? ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry""... that's gone now... Sigh...9) speaking of which... Why on earth would the Hulk go into battle in an amour suit? Surely that was made for Bruce when the Hulk refused to come out to play?How would the Hulk fit inside and why would he need it? That's taking power away from the Hulk and it pissed me off...10) if the Ancient One knows and sees all possibilities... Even knowing when Dr Strange will show up... How did she not see the Hulk coming to ask for the stone?11) Loki's escape with the tesseract surely would have spun an alternate time line... Since there is only ONE tesseract... Then much of the previous stories wouldn't really make sense if Loki had it almost immediately after he lost it ...12) Captain America basically anointed the Falcon to be the next Capt? *Roll eyes*...I think the Falcon already has a lot going and Bucky should be a better successor...
In any case, we won't see Thor succeed the iron Man suit because he doesn't really need the extra edge...
Bucky is a super soldier in the same vein as the Capt. And should have been his first choice for a successor...13) did Captain America just ignore world events for the last century while he hid with Peggy? (& what did he do after she died... Surely she can't live as long as he... Wouldn't he simply come back to the 'present' having enjoyed a full and loving life, and not yet as old as he became?) ... The Production team might wish to rewatch Highlander...😋He never got the itch to help the 'current' Captain America fight injustice? He resisted the urge to pass on information that might help the avengers as he had lived through all the events before? (I know, I know... Can't/shouldn't change history... But how could he resist, for someone like him who loves to lecture and lead?)14) the biggest plot hole of all and the one that buried the movie for me... is...The Thanos that was in the battle came from before the previous movie right? (Infinity war)...If Tony Stark kills Thanos in this movie... That means none of the previous movie plot could have happened... Nobody was ""killed off"" (not even Loki...)... Nobody lost/gained 5 years of their lives... Thor didn't need to get fat, none of this movie should even get started...That's the devil when idiot film makers dabble with time travel in a non-time-travel movie... Adding this means they can't take care of the details properly...The above are just the main plot annoyances... And there and many other smaller ones which prevented a truly epic movie experience...3 hours is a long movie and much of it unnecessary if they tightened the plot to make more sense...So, while the movie is good...I wouldn't selectively watch it again... Which to me is the benchmark of a great movie.I'm torn in giving a rating... I want to give 7 based on the scale of the production and emotional ties it has on me from all the previous Marvel movies...But the constant I'm jolted with throughout the film killed much of my buzz and for that I want to give it a 2... Sto be fair... it'll get a 4 overall to balance both sides...","10/10"
"malcolmwrites","3 July 2023","I'll make this quick, and I'll put it in bullet-point form for the sake of convenience.(By the way, I'm the ultimate Indiana Jones fan. If you don't believe it, just ask me.) :)The Bad Stuff:1. Terrible subtitle for the movie. Before this, we had ""Raiders,"" ""Doom,"" Crusade,"" and even ""Skulls."" (Ugh.) ""Dial of Destiny"" isn't exciting. It's not sexy. It's a laundry detergent ad..maybe.2. Too many epic actions sequences. Spielberg knew how to space these out. There's a rhythm and flow to good pacing. Any one of these actions scenes would have been fine on its own. But all together...it's too much. Indy needs to stop and breathe. Have a tea with Sallah. Fall asleep on a boat with Marion. Insult your host over dinner at Pankot Palace. Have a drink on a blimp with your dad.3. The underwater scene. Indy is a classroom guy. He's a desert guy. He's even a jungle guy. Everything he is gets drowned underwater.4. Not enough Marion. (Is there even such a thing as too much Marion?) If the producers want to use their time dial thingy for anything, it should be to flash back to the writers' room and have someone put up a hand and say, ""If this is going to be Indy's send-off, it HAS to be him and Marion together all the way!""The Good Stuff:1. It's still Indy. Mangold and the writers preserved the essence of his character and all the best things about him. The grumpiness. The reckless bravery. The nobility. The fear. The passion. The eternally loyal fedora. It's all there like it's supposed to be.2. Phone Waller-Bridge. Of course there's going to be some hate out there. She's a snarky Brit, after all. But her character is smart, clever, charismatic, articulate, devious, funny, brave, and her story arc parallels Indy's own arc in Temple of Doom. (Going from capitalistic ""fortune and glory"" to ""I know it's worth now"" when he comes back to the village with the Shankar Stones.) So everyone please just chill on her. She's no Marion, but she's not supposed to be. And she's a bazillion times better than Willie or Elsa.3. The Morocco scenes. The colors, the backdrop, the ambiance, the crazy chase...all 100% Indy.4. The de-aging CGI. Okay, so they obscured it with some clever angles and dark lighting. But it wasn't bad. Nothing screamed Uncanny Valley, and we could enjoy classic Indy without being forced into cringy laughter at the technology. (At this rate, they'll be able to make a full movie with a totally believable thirty-five year old Indy. The line to see that starts behind me.)5. Speaking of aging...good on everyone involved for leaning into Indy's age. Every groan, complaint, quip, and word of wisdom...it's all totally Indy. Sallah and Marion, too.Final result? Everyone's into ranking the five films, so here's my take:1. Raiders. (Of course.)2. Crusade. (Nearly a no-brainer for second place)3. Temple of Doom AND Dial of Destiny are tied for third. Either of them works equally well as an imperfect but fun bit of Saturday afternoon escapism.Skulls isn't allowed in my house.Final bit of advice from one Indy fan to another:Relax. Don't overthink it. Before anything else, Indy is supposed to be a thrill-a-minute joyride. This one may have its bumps, but it's still what it's supposed to be, and it takes us along for the ride as promised.","1/10"
"MamadNobari97","16 February 2023","Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men.","6/10"
"Manal1987","22 January 2013","""Krishna opens his mouth, and Yashoda gasps she sees in Krishna's mouth the whole complete entire timeless universe!""The following is a story Pi's mother recounts to him as a kid. The young god Krishna was wrongly accused of eating a bit of dirt. When his foster mother, Yashoda, knows about it, she scolds him and orders him to open his mouth, inside which she sees the whole universe; lands and skies, planets and galaxies, past and future, hopes and fears everything.This religious Hindu story should be kept at the back of your mind throughout the entire film for it sets ups the stage for Pi's life. The movie starts with the adult Pi Patel who narrates to a novelist his own survival adventure; how he survived a violent shipwreck in which he lost his entire family and his father's zoo animals, and how he managed to coexist with a Bengal tiger for weeks on a stranded lifeboat. The story of Pi, originally written by Yann Martel and adapted to screen by David Magee, succeeds in stripping the confusing issue of faith down to its core. Pi, the result of a world which is part secular (the father) and part shyly religious (the mother), represents the modern man with all his anxiety, confusion and questions. The young Pi could feel a greater power controlling the universe even though he could not place or define this power. That is why he became a Hindu, a Christian, and a Muslim, all at the same time.The movie is dense with symbolic cues that will need to be revisited and reconsidered every time you ponder on Pi's adventure. First of all, we are told that the Bengal tiger is called Richard Parker because its original name, Thirsty, was swapped with the name of its hunter in the registers. When young Pi gets attached to Richard, his atheist father feels obliged to prove to him that Richard is merely a beast and that it is not soul that he sees in the tiger's eyes but only a reflection of his own emotions. Whether the tiger had a soul or was only a reflected image of Pi is left to the viewer to decide. Moreover, Pi's adventure in the sea can be interpreted as man's journey through life, full of hopes, hardships, miracles and letdowns. Everything Pi encounters helps in his emotional, spiritual, and intellectual growth. However, what makes Pi different is that he manages to live life and see (and make us see as well!) the universe as reflected inside him.The ending of the film is absolutely brilliant. It gives place for both doubt and belief equally because, as Pi puts it, ""doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested."" After the shipwreck, the hypo-narrative (Pi's adventure) gets divided into two parallel, if not opposite, stories; one is miraculous and incredible, and the other is gruesome yet realistic. The adult Pi gives us the freedom to choose between the two because, according to him, both stories entail the same amount of suffering and sacrifice and have the same result and choosing to believe in one of them depends on the person's internal universe. Simply put, in any given moment of your life, you have all the reasons to be happy and you have all the reasons to be sad.. it is you who chooses, and it is you who writes the story. And this is how faith works. This is how God works.Life of Pi is certainly Ang Lee's masterpiece so far; thoughtful direction, celestial cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and mature and vivid performance by both Suraj Sharma, who masterfully captured Pi's earlier years of confusion and restlessness, and Irrfan Khan who played the adult Pi with sincere, hard-earned maturity and confidence. The film is relatively long, but there is not a single moment you will feel the slightest tinge of boredom throughout this completely immersive experience.Life of Pi is a feast for both the mind and the eye. A definitely must- see.","10/10"
"manasbhati","1 June 2023","They somehow managed to top almost every aspect of the first film. An extraordinary display of what animation is capable of. They're just showing off at this point...I guess the one thing that's worse than the first film is the plot. However, unlike the first one, Across the Spider-Verse exists to create a grand setup for the final film, and boy, it does that really well. Still can't beat the personal journey of Miles in the first movie though.Plus Daniel Pemberton's music is as good as ever. Each one of his themes used in the first film are thrown into overdrive here, and the brand new themes he introduces aren't too shabby.","10/10"
"Mangalassery_Neelakandan","5 June 2023","One of the best if not the best spiderman movies out there. Mahn what a journey it was, the story, the score, the action sequences, the pace everything was top notch. For me this move is right there with no way home & spiderman 2. It had all the references in the world and that was really a fan treat. From the pointing meme, to the iconic scenes it was a total package.The animation style like in the first movie was the main highlight, the comic book like animation along with the fast changing frames was great, but some portions need to be paused to read what all are written there as it was there only for like a frame or two, but still, the effort they took just to animate a single frame and put that much detail on it is just epic.This dealt with multiverse more than the multiverse of madness, it showed every spiderman that can be shown in a 140 min film, the main leads, Miles, Gwen, Peter, Miguel, spider-women, spider man india, everyone had their own space in the film.If i kept on going there will be lot of spoilers so, keeping it simple, this is a must watch film for all spidey fans, the cliffhanger ending made this movie even special for me as i kept on wondering that they would rush a climax just for the sake of it, also there is no mid, or end credit scene, waited in the theater for atleast 5 minutes but there was nothing at all.","1/10"
"mangoturtle","17 February 2023","This is very much a set up movie for the new big bad, despite that it is an entertaining movie and probably one of the better things the mcu had com out with since the multiverse saga started. Jonathan Majors who a couple years ago was completely unheard of and is just suddenly in everything steals the show as Kang in this movie. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeffer and Evangeline Lily have strong performances as always. It's funny, has a good soundtrack and outstanding visuals. Definitely a solid 7/10, not a must see for anyone who doesn't follow these films religiously, but it will be a good watch for anyone who sees it.P. S props to the creature and world building designers, the Quantum Realm landscape is fascinating.","7/10"
"marcusbrianlong","23 February 2023","Quantum mania is the 3rd ant man film it introduce a new villain called Kang the conqueror who steals the show along with Janet. It also deals with Scott dealing with his daughter who is now a teenager who has been in prison just like her dad because Scott missed 5 years of life in the the Movie Endgame. It also show a bit of backstory of happened to Janet in the Quantum realm that we did not see in the last movie. It also shares a bit backstory on Kang who in this movie is soft spoken and very serious. This movie is also setting up Kang to be the next big bad villain. There is also 2 scenes at the end.","7/10"
"marcusnichols","27 April 2019","I don't know where to start!!
Plot holes all the way through,
Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee.","2/10"
"Mardolin","24 April 2019","Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.","6/10"
"Marian25","31 May 2023","It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away.Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!","10/10"
"mariannealindsell","1 July 2023","Disappointing, I'm sorry to say.I'm actually a big fan of the Ant-Man series; I like the first two, and I had hoped for better in this one.First of all, the acting was fine, and Jonathan Majors was great choice for Kang.The effects were also accomplished. Even the pace was good.The title was the single worst thing about this film; ""Quantumania"" implies some delving into or exploration of quantum effects. I could discern no meaningful connection with quantum effects at all, unless you count the ""probability storm"", whatever that is.The film refers to 'the quantum realm' as if it were a separate place from reality, which you could visit.I did read a comic strip years ago about atoms being like miniature worlds, inhabited by militaristic aliens who somehow escaped into the macro world and caused mayhem. As a fantasy comic strip, that kind of worked, especially as much less was known about subatomic level physics in those days.But the physical feel and production design of this film doesn't even feel like it has a connection with subatomic physics, - even a fantasy one.It comes across more as a kind of fairyland, or (if I'm feeling generous) as belonging to a parallel spacetime continuum.So, apart from introducing Kang the Conqueror, and the bit with the ants, the storyline is nonsense.Also, I felt that the whole concept of being able to shrink or grow with the aid of technology was not used well.Of course we all suspend disbelief when watching MCU movies, as we did with the original comic-strips, but one of the beauties of the MCU films is that they give these fantasies physical form, and make it seem almost as if they could exist in the real world.This film treats the shrink/grow technology as a 'blink of the eye'/'click of the fingers' affair, more like the waving of a magic wand than the activation of a technology. It is the poorer for this.I hope the Ant-man series runs to a 4th film, but also that it avoids these let-downs.Most of all, please avoid the use of terms like 'Quantum' or 'Multiverse' unless you intend to show some actualisation or representation of the science concepts behind these terms.And please may we have a sci-fi element to the story, rather than just some random, disconnected fantasy?","3/10"
"Marjuk_Ocean","20 September 2023","""Avengers: Endgame"" - A Spectacular Culmination of Marvel's Cinematic UniverseIn the realm of superhero cinema, ""Avengers: Endgame"" stands as an unprecedented achievement. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, this epic finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) represents the culmination of over a decade of storytelling and character development. Clocking in at just over three hours, ""Endgame"" is a sprawling, emotionally charged spectacle that delivers on its promise to provide closure for beloved characters while reshaping the MCU's future.The film begins in the aftermath of ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" with half of all life in the universe obliterated by the malevolent Thanos (Josh Brolin). The surviving Avengers are left reeling, grappling with guilt and loss. The emotional weight of this situation is palpable, setting a somber tone that lingers throughout the movie.One of the film's strengths lies in its character-driven narrative. Each Avenger is given ample screen time to grapple with the consequences of their actions and confront their own vulnerabilities. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a standout performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, showcasing his character's evolution from a self-centered genius to a selfless hero. Similarly, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow bring depth and gravitas to their roles.""Endgame"" also skillfully employs humor to offset its darker moments. The banter between characters provides much-needed levity, ensuring the film remains entertaining even during its most emotionally charged sequences. This balance of humor and pathos has been a hallmark of the MCU and is executed with finesse here.One of the film's most impressive feats is its ability to seamlessly weave together multiple storylines and characters. The time-travel aspect of the plot allows the Avengers to revisit key moments from previous films, resulting in a nostalgic and satisfying trip down memory lane for fans. It's a testament to the filmmakers' dedication to honoring the MCU's history while moving the narrative forward.The action sequences in ""Endgame"" are nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle in the third act is a visual feast, featuring a jaw-dropping array of heroes, powers, and epic showdowns. It's a triumphant moment that pays off years of anticipation and buildup. The Russo brothers' direction, combined with Alan Silvestri's stirring score, elevates these sequences to a cinematic crescendo.As for the film's antagonist, Thanos remains a formidable and complex foe. Brolin's motion-capture performance adds depth to the character, and his motivations, while morally questionable, are presented with a degree of philosophical nuance. Thanos remains one of the MCU's most compelling villains.However, ""Endgame"" is not without its criticisms. Some viewers may find the film's lengthy runtime a bit daunting, and certain plot elements involving time travel could be seen as overly convoluted. Additionally, a few character arcs, while emotionally satisfying, may leave fans divided.In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a monumental achievement in the world of superhero cinema. It successfully pays tribute to the characters and stories that have captivated audiences for years while charting a bold new course for the MCU. With its powerful performances, humor, and breathtaking action sequences, it's a fitting and emotional conclusion to an era of cinematic storytelling. While it may not be without its minor flaws, ""Endgame"" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the superhero genre and will likely be remembered as a cinematic milestone for years to come.","8/10"

Now, let's get this straight. Life of Pi has just shown that thereis life left in 3D. It may be, on the whole, a gimmick but the exception can still prove the point. Only two movies have made the 3D entrance fee worth the extra IMHO, Avatar and this. It's a tough movie for bibliophiles to even want to see because thebook is so magnificent (in my all time top ten probably) and many I've spoken to who love it equally are just downright scared that Ang Lee was going to blow it. The odds were strongly in favour ofthat happening because it's a pretty full on philosophical workout. So full credit has to go to Fox pictures for shelling out $120 million on the ultimate movie gamble. How Ang manages to retain the existential angst of the book AND make a blockbuster movie that holds the attention from start to finish (yes, including the pretty turgid first 100 pages) is not only anyone's guess but a cinematic achievement of considerable merit. It's the storytelling that wins the day but it's wrapped up in cinematography of the very highest order. So many times one gasps out loud at what's on screen that it's like a day out in a theme park. Surely the Oscar for this is certain to go to Claudio Miranda (Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac, Benjamin Button). The acting is universally good but it's the tiger, Richard Parker, and his four legged companions that really steal the show. CGI has never, ever been this good. This might sound like it's the technology that carries the movie but don't think that. It's an honest, stunning exploration of the true meaning of life, religion and truth and it's an absolute must see. I would not discount it winning best movie come early March and I certainly wouldn't grudge it. Ang Lee's finest hour.","10/10"

"markovd111","9 July 2023","As all of you who are reading reviews of this movie on this site, I am a fan of the character and the movie series. I grew up with them and constantly watched them while growing up making numerous memories and bonding with whoever I watched it with. I am a devoted fan as much as you are.I was scared of the fifth movie. The fourth one was bad and with Ford's age and current trends in Hollywood, I really expected a mediocre blockbuster which at best you watch for fun and forget soon after. I was ready to be disappointed due to bad to mediocre reviews and rumours. Yet, despite that, me and my brother decided to go to the cinema and watch the movie for fun and judge it ourselves.Sure, I could nitpick. I could tell you the movie is too long. I could tell you that digital de-aging used in the movie's intro (despite it's cost and technological achievement) often looks like you are watching a video game/animated movie character running around. I could tell you that some action scenes are too over the top even for the franchise itself. I could tell you that it takes too long to get used to some of the characters and so on, and so on...But I could also tell you that a big warm smile from ear to ear was on my and my brother's face when the credits rolled and legendary John William's theme started playing. I was literally overflown with emotion and could cry from the feelings movie made me feel as a fan. I personally think that, even though it's obvious, undeniable and also unquestionably natural that the movie is a big nostalgia bait/trip, it's far more than a simple try to cash in on aforementioned nostalgia. The way I see it, the movie approaches both it's main character and the actor behind it, Harrison Ford, and the whole movie franchise and it's universe and characters with a lot of respect, thought, appropriate humour and care. I do not think it's a perfect movie. But I think that it's miles and miles better than the fourth one and that it can without a problem stand shoulder to shoulder with the original trilogy. And even if you don't agree with me on this one, you have to agree it's better than the fourth one. And if it's better than a fourth one, it's at least a good enough movie to watch for fun, right?So, what are you waiting for?! Grab your mom, dad, brother, sister, grandpa, grandma, girlfriend, boyfriend, friend or anyone at all you connect this character with and go say goodbye both to legendary Harrison Ford and equally legendary archaeologist with fedora and a whip he portrayed, Dr. Henry Walton ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr.! 8/10! A warm recommendation!","8/10"
"marksez","28 April 2013","This is a spectacular movie, and those are rare these days.How could anyone not like this movie and its story? The special effects are almost seamless and the fitting together of ""real"" moments and moments that must be fantasy (the lake-like calm clear ocean in a dreamlike sequence, the floating island, as examples).So, it borrows a bit from ""Castaway"" with the storm, the sinking vessel, the whale, landing on an island, to name a few examples, it still holds our attention throughout and does everything else superbly.And of course the zinger is the twist at the end when we learn that the entire story we just watched may be a metaphor for what really happened, and we are given the choice of which story to choose. That's a nice bit of Twilight Zoniness that adds a great touch.I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I knew it had gotten a lot of good press, but that is no guarantee of a good movie. This one earns all of the good stuff people say about it.","7/10"

"martimusross","27 August 2023","Spider-Man - Across the Spider verseI am at a loss to understand the high scores on this movie, it was tedious in the extreme, we had no proper story, all that remained was emotions, feelings and a whole array of woke tropes. The one thing that is central to the Spider-man comics is a good strong story and nearly every film reflects this need, here it was missing.The graphics were very weird and at times just looked half finished, it was very much style over substance, Disney/Pixar would have realised this so we, the viewer, remain focused on the story and not the artwork. Animation must not be the star of the show, it is merely a vehicle in telling a story, even in Tron, animation at its most extreme, served to tell the story.With had scene after scene of breathless freneticism, I was quite frankly bored, this amounts to ""meat and no bones"", you just cannot sustain a movie on action alone, you observe in Rocky or Mission Impossible how all the action sequences are balanced with other elements.I really can't see why this movie was made and who was the target audience, I am a life long fan of Spider-Man, and this left me cold as it had just nothing for the fans, and it totally lacked any humour which is key.I'm giving this 2 outta 10 to my mind it was a disaster.","7/10"
"martimusross","29 August 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of DestinyWe had a brilliant strong start, a flashback with Nazis, historical artefacts for the Fuhrer, an elongated fight sequence and our hero dealing with heaps of baddies.As the movie progressed we had a good strong story but, to my mind, the casting just didn't work on many levels. Fiona Waller-Bridge, high marks for duplicity and dedication to the role, low marks for glamour, and chemistry between her and Harrison Ford. Her character seemingly vying for the lead in the movie, no one and mean no one outclasses Indiana Jones.On structure we seem to have quite a repetition of similar scenes and the action sequences were overly long unbalancing the narrative flow. The time travel elements towards the end were a great idea but just poorly executed, such a shame!Two aspects were largely lacking, humour and that dry wry wit that Indiana Jones is defined by, secondly the relationships forged under adversity often of a flirtatious nature. I appreciate Harrison Ford is 81, but Indiana Jones never ages.The camera work and music were great but that was about it. I'm giving this a weak 6 outta 10, meaning it didn't really deliver for the fans and was a pale facsimile of what might have been, however I am glad I watched it, I fear we are at the end of the road with this franchise.","6/10"

"martinrobertson300482","20 March 2013","I Was in two minds about ""Life of Pi,"" but hearing its high praise from others made me curious enough too see it.I Can still see it as something people will either take or leave though. Its about an Indian boy who gets trapped on a boat with a tiger, so seems like a random idea to begin with. Or is it an original idea? Either way, its both so visually amazing, and beatifically weird, how the film makes a full length feature out off such a bizarre subject, that its hard to ignore. Making me understand where its Oscar nods are coming from.It does get a bit too weird later on though, and despite having some laughs, it can hardly be described as a comedy. In fact its hard to figure out what ""Life of PI"" wants to be, but maybe that's part off what makes it so new and unique. Its special effects are what got it noticed, and they are very good, even though that damn tiger does seem to change size throughout the movie. Something the animators still seem too have trouble getting right, even these days.","7/10"
"martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024","Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor.","3/10"
"Martipee","5 February 2024","One of the worst things in Hollywood is to see a popular star relegate themselves to B-Grade movies, either due to finances or lack of opportunities. Jason Statham should not be one of those, but you have to wonder why he made this movie.Basically, its absolute rubbish. Lets ignore that its an Australian movie, but considering some of the cast, the money on offer must have been good and included a free holiday on the Gold Coast.Storyline is about as original as a loaf of bread, the script lines were obviously limited to a small number of letters because it lacked a quality barely above a kids show, and the guys Statham had to fight were nothing more than statues awaiting to be hit.If you're a Statham worshipper, bored or low in IQ, its watchable, but be aware, you were warned.","1/10"
"maruugaa","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","9/10"
"marveltstodd","17 February 2023","What works:
Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne.A great little surprise cameo by Bill Murray.Paul Rudd has always been well cast as Ant-Man/Scott Lang, same with Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne.Its obvious Jonathan Majors is very talented.The problem:
Like with the MCU's Phase 4 clear direction to the audience where this story is going. We need a central character like Iron Man/ Tony Stark to follow like in Phases 1-3 and a well defined threat for the individual characters and eventually a team of Avengers.The beginning of the Young Avengers, I'm excited to see this new team form which I'm sure will include Cassie Lang. However, the audience still has characters from Phases 1-3 that need more plot and time like The Wasp/Hope Van Dyne. The character is cast perfectly and the film forgets she is there during most of it.In this film as well as the ending of ""Loki"" Season One, Kang is difficult in my view to see as a threat. This was a great opportunity to make the audience scared of this character by showing some sort of shocking action sequence or demise of a major character in the MCU.The special effects in the Quantum realm look great, however the Modok character looks surprisingly AWFUL.Modok - please never mention this character again. Marvel what were you thinking here? YikesI'm getting nervous as these films through Phases 1-3 have had major success financially, critically, and with Marvel comic book fans. But something is very off starting with Phase 4. For every excellent film like ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" there is another project like ""She Hulk"" that is so bad it makes me embarrassed as a fan.The audience has seen what Marvel is capable of so when we consume projects like this, She Hulk, and Ms. Marvel, we know that something is wrong and we just want better projects again.Come on Marvel I believe in you! Lets get this universe back on track!","6/10"
"Marvo2369","3 July 2023","Well let's start off with the negatives and work from there.The film does lack something that the original films were famous for, and that was a fear factor. Whether it was the deadly traps in the temples, or the horrifying and gruesome deaths in the action sequences, Indiana Jones was famous for its shocking imagery and it's scary suspenseful intense scenes. This film doesn't have any of that, but that's to be expected for a Disney film. It's heavily died down for the younger audience, which let's face it, kids aren't gonna watch a sequel to a franchise as old as this. But that's a problem with Disney, nothing to do with this film or the quality of it. Instead of servicing the fan base that was around for these films, they decide to try and make it appealing for their new audiences which to me doesn't make sense at all. But it was fine, just very 'Disneyfied' in terms of everything visual etc. It had that very generic Disney look, for example the underwater scene with the skeletons just looked like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean. But again, I can look past this.The other gripe are the action sequences. Once again, the trailer has shown you anything and everything that was interesting in this film. It revealed all the action scenes to you and left nothing to the surprise in theatres. So basically all the action you see in the trailer is all you get. The rest is just story progression. Also, this film could have offered so much more in terms of variety in action other than the same generic chase sequences that ran throughout. That's right - every action sequence was pretty much just a car bike or train chase. Nothing else much happened really. So the action was nothing compared to the first few films. The other issue with the action is Indy doesn't really do much, and of course, that's because he can't. As old as Harrison Ford is, he's very limited to what he can do. And instead of the charming action we got in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, in this we just got him throwing a few weak punches, getting thrown down and pulling away in fear from a gun. So he doesn't offer much, and he physically can't. So the issue there for me is, he was too old for this type of movie. However, if you can set all that aside for a great story and interesting new adventure, then you're in for a treat.Because besides the generic action and lack of physical movement from Indy, what we do have is an array of fun and engaging characters who all play their parts really well in a captivating classic Indiana Jones adventure. If you're an Indiana Jones fan, you'll totally get into this movie (even if it feels over the top ridiculous, which an Indiana Jones movie is supposed to be). It has that same charm and humour to it as the others and delivers a new and exciting (and interestingly clever) concept, and delivers beautiful nostalgia throughout. The film looks beautiful visually in places and you can tell the filmmakers loved making this movie. The work they put into this has paid off. The imagery throughout is masterful and offers some classic Indiana moments. The ending is beautiful and serves Indy justice in the end.The overall story is meaningful and worthwhile, and for me delivers on everything important to Indy's legacy. You can tell the director took a lot of care with this film and made the script work to its favour and served me as a fan of the franchise well. The director took the past movies into consideration and used their history to craft this film well and for me it honestly paid off. Also, Phoebes character is not really that irritating and I found blended well into the story. Honestly, she integrated like any of the other female characters in the other films. And the dynamic between her and Indy worked well.Overall, I almost missed this film because of the reviews. But I'm so glad I didn't. If you're an original Indiana Jones fan, you're gonna enjoy it. It's not the best entry, but it certainly is the last and a decent one at that. It's honestly worth the watch and I thoroughly enjoyed those 2 and a half hours. They flew by.Give it a go. It's like marmite. You either love it, or you hate it. But boy I love it.","9/10"
"marwinsingh-30063","4 February 2024","This is 4th Jason Statham movie I saw in span of just 12 months year Operation Fortune, The Meg 2 , Expende4bles and now The Beekeeper.. I will be not wrong to say that he Jason is one of the best action hero of Hollywood like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, JCVD and Bruce Willis were in 80s and 90s, all these are known for taking down enemies while shooting , kicking, punching and their one man army attitude..The Beekeeper is directed by David Ayer who is a good director, starring Jason Statham as a mysterious man who worked for a mysterious organization in the past comes out of retirement to take down some cyber criminals who hacks bank accounts of innocent public and scam them.. Do i need to say more??? Entire movie is filled with hardcore action from good hand to hand combat, puching and kicking with some shootout scenes meanwhile epic one liners delivered by Jason's character Adam Clay...
Just turn off your brain and enjoy this action ride if you love watching action films, this one won't dissapoint....","8/10"
"marwinsingh-30063","4 June 2023","Spider man across the spider verse is one the best movies based on comic books i've ever seen.. It had everything I've ever dreamed of as a Spider Man fan... From groundbreaking visuals to unique animation to colorfull different universes to awesome soundtrack with decent action scenes and a great story it has everything you need from a comic book movie.. It looks like an comic book comes to life.. Set after 1yr of previous film this film explores Miles Morales's character of Spider Man and also expand on the character of Gwen Stacy/ Spider Woman.. I always wanted to see Spider Man 2099 and my wish got true with this film.. The scene where entire Spider society chase Miles Morales is highlight of this movie and will become iconic in future.. Seeing hundreds of different versions of Spider Man such as Scarlet Spider, Spider Punk, Spider Man Unlimited, Spider Man India, Ps4 Spider Man, Spider Man 2000, Spectacular Spider Man, Lego Spider Man etc in a single scene was feast to the eyes and satisfaction to the soul.. Story wise it was also amazing filled with many dramatic elements to scenes of full thrill and suspense with some comedy was amazing to experience.. Color palette of this movie is unique each universe has a different vibe to it.. Even though I don't watch many animated movies I can proudly say my love for Spider Man leads me to a theatre and gave me an once in a lifetime opportunity to experience this on a big screen.. Can't wait for next installment and very excited to see how this universe will grow from here.. Every comic book lover should see this film in theater and die hard fans of Spider man can't miss this one.. It gave me same experience I got with Spider Man No Way Home.... Can't wait to see what happens next since it ended on a cliffhanger.. Kids will love this film for sure and adults with also enjoy this... Best animated movie ever... 10/10 highly recommend. Thank you Sony Pictures for bringing us Spider Verse on big screen I'll be forever in the debt... 🕷 🕸 ❤","10/10"
"Marynewcomb2013","11 October 2018","I say this a lot but, DON'T LISTEN TO THE HYPE!! This movie is the worst to date!! They didn't stick to the comics hardly at all,( I'm not an Avengers comic fan)!! Prime example of not sticking to the source material, the fight with the bad guy where they try to take the glove off his hand & having Starlord being a complete a..hole IS NOT IN THE COMIC!! What Disney did, & they do this better than any, is take a beloved character from Gardians & turn him into someone you can't stand!! That's a small example of how they messed up!! I've been saying this for a long time now but I will still say it until they finally do it, GIVE THE COMIC MOVIES A LONG LONG BREAK!!! We don't need to see two or three every year!!","3/10"
"Masami-J","12 June 2023","""This film is a real pearl of cinema. The plot is gripping and exciting from start to finish, with a fast pace that keeps the audience glued to their seats. The characters principal are all very good and their teamwork is perfect, creating an atmosphere of genuine empathy with the audience. The script is elegant and well thought out, with perfectly dosed moments of emotion and laughter. In addition, the direction is superb, with breathtaking cinematography that does justice to the spectacular scenery and landscapes in which the characters move. Finally, the music is good. I recommend everyone to see this film, as it is an experience not to be missed and you will certainly appreciate it much more than one might expect"".","10/10"
"mason25","13 January 2024","As always Jason Statham delivers the goods. The script though wasn't so great. Glaringly ridiculous things happen that make little to no sense.Mafia boy takes some goons out to grandma's house, and shoot up some beehives.... sure, makes sense if you're 12 and getting revenge.The replacement girl that shows up at the gas station...WHAT THE F???? If you're a secret agent of basically any sort, your entire persona and style will be nondescript, you want to blend in EVERYWHERE. So of course she shows up, wearing hot pink, some stupid hairdo, oh, and a mini-gun on the back of her pickup.... which she then proceeds to shoot up this gas station, which doesn't seem to have anyone working at it.Fast forward to the end, and what was with the cowering drunken knife wielding guy at the top of the steps??? I know he's supposed to just throw the fight, he's just an unnamed grunt dressed like all the rest, but wow, go back to training classes on how to make it look believable.Also of note, are the utterly ridiculous costumes worn by the ""special squad"" morons. Who also don't seem to be fazed by who is coming after them. Cowboy hats and bright colored leather coats.... they must have shopped at the same place the replacement girl from the gas station did.Fbi girl, she seemed really really undecided on whether or not she did or did not want to apprehend Statham. She sees he's doing a good thing, doesn't like where it's taking him...OH WELL, let the man work and maybe he'll solve some problems you and your pals obviously can't or won't.It was decent enough to watch once, might give it another shot in a few years.","3/10"
"masonfisk","30 January 2024","The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter.","4/10"
"masonsaul","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness.","7/10"
"masonsaul","18 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania frustratingly serves the greater the MCU a lot more than it should, abandoning a lot of the stakes and the franchise's unique aspects for a safe and predictable 2 hour phase 5 trailer that confirms the Ant Man trilogy to be the weakest so far.However, it's still a fun and enjoyably wacky sci-fi adventure that doesn't overstay it's welcome, offers the occasional reminder that the MCU formula can work and features a terrific villain in the form of Jonathan Majors' Kang.Paul Rudd is great, it's an inherently safe performance that's likeable without displaying that much range and he nails that yet again. Despite sharing the title Evangeline Lily gets very little to do but Michael Douglas is the scene stealer with the best humour and a lot less expositional dialogue this time around.Kang is a generically evil character here but in the hands of Jonathan Majors he is an absolute force of nature, elevating this one note character into a softly spoken menace who brings the film to life whenever he's on screen.Peyton Reed's direction is fine, it looks competent overall with a few visually impressed moments but struggles to establish real scale within the quantum realm. The CG is the same as it always with these, hit and miss throughout and alternating from impressive to awful within the same scene.The music by Christophe Beck is a bit of a letdown, none of that playfulness or sense of fun that makes the previous Ant-Man scores so memorable is here and it only really comes to life during the credits.","7/10"
"masonsaul","28 April 2023","Life of Pi is incredible, a technical marvel that has the nuanced and thought provoking story to match it's technical wonders resulting in an extremely rewarding and really spiritual film. It's a beautiful story about self reflection and coming to terms with your own rage shown through an epic adventure at sea.Irrfan Khan makes sure the film starts and ends strong, an elegant storyteller guiding you through this journey with a heartfelt honesty. Suraj Sharma is equally good as the younger Pi, bringing that youthful energy and humour that matures as the film goes along.Ang Lee's direction is amazing, the film is one of the most beautiful films ever made with go for broke imagery and a colour palette so vivid it was destined to be on blu ray & TV adverts forever. Even when watching it in 2-D it's still very easy to see the clear technical craft on display in the 3-D photography.The CG is really impressive, there's a few weak spots undoubtedly hurt further by the higher frame rate but overall it doesn't detract that much. The music by Mychael Danna definitely matches the imagery in awe inspiring beauty as well as having the required soulfulness.","9/10"
"masonsaul","3 June 2023","From its very first opening moments, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an undeniable work of art. A bigger, bolder sequel that's not afraid to take its time with its character's growth and truly understands the character. Exploring in extremely meta, reality bending fashion the true burden of being Spider-Man.Shameik Moore is once again perfect, he's able to portray how Miles has grown since the first film effortlessly and remains loveable. Hailee Steinfeld is even better than last time with the best arc of the film, its just as much her film as it is Miles. Jason Schwartzman is great as the Spot, able go from being a joke to a genuine threat in really convincing fashion.Out of the new Spider-people, Oscar Isaac brings a palpable anger to Miguel O'Hara that conveys the burden he has and the lengths he'll go to and Daniel Kaluuya is the best new addition as Hobie, an unashamedly British character with the strongest moral compass and never betrays it, making him an easy favourite.In the years since the original came out, a fair few films have clearly been inspired by its animation and put their own spin on it but directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Justin K. Thompson and Kemp Powers do an excellent job of reminding you nothing can compete with Spider-verse. Its the literal definition of every frame a painting and every new dimension is so vibrant and unique.The soundtrack and score by Daniel Pemberton remain highlights, maintaining a strong balance between the two but Pemberton has really outdone himself with this score. It brings back all the themes that were so unique and memorable whilst adding new ones that are equally strong, if not better.","10/10"
"masterarcan","31 May 2023","Not only they canonize Broly, giving him a better backstory than the old movie, they did so much more.The first part of the movie is set on planet Vegeta shortly before its destruction at the hands of Frieza, explaining the origins of Broly, also introducing, for the first time in a canonical way, King Vegeta, Bardock and his wife, making us quite an idea to what kind of characters they actually were. The second part, on the other hand, is set on Earth, roughly after the tournament of power, we'll see an enormously extended amount of fight scenes, where Gogeta will also make an appearance, finally becoming canon.The animation is really smooth and dynamic, best seen in a Dragon Ball movie, this time the 3D animation is well done.Personally, the best Dragon Ball movie so far.","9/10"
"mastiff-man","22 February 2023","All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments.","7/10"
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","26 April 2019","There have been few movies in history that created this kind of hype - a sociological and emotional mass hysteria that covered the globe. An expectation that surpassed all others, an ending that everyone was expecting yet caught everyone by surprise, shock and awe. Endgame had a lot of expectations to fulfill, and it surpassed them all... light years from what was expected.Never has a year passed so quickly and with so much hype. The end days before the premiere were filled with nothing but expectation, fingernail biting and prolonged stages of sleep deprivation and theory development. If one was being scrubbed by one's boss - it didn't matter - Endgame is in a couple of days... if one was ill, one got better on the day of the premiere. Endgame had an effect that was so much more than a movie. It was an event of a generation, an ending to a decade long story and the finalization of all the character's arks. And yet, it had to be a sequel worthy of Infinity war. How was this possible to achieve all that in a single movie?1) The story. Unlike Infinity war which was much more a character driven movie (especially Thanos and the gang on Titan) Endgame is a story driven movie. The entire movie is split in three segments: a) the beginning; b) the middle; c) the endgame. The beginning is a bit rushed, uneasy on the casual viewer, expecting too much from the audience to follow in one moment. But then, it slows down, takes it's time with a realization that these characters are at their end and the story converges into a goodbye of sorts from their most important counterparts and their most important segments from the last ten years. This is Endgame's most triumphant segment - the realization of the magnitude of its characters and their meaning in the end - their own humanity and importance that they have for the viewers. However, Endgame holds its most powerful aspects 'til the very end. The climactic battle with Thanos and his army (again) is one that can easily rival Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit or Kingdom of Heaven etc. But, the magnitude of the battle and the number of heroes involved makes the endgame battle so powerful and overwhelming that it leaves the viewer in a perpetual state of adrenaline fulled with hype from start to finish. It is almost impossible to keep track of where all of them are and what they are doing but that is the best part - all of them are completely involved with everything they got - whatever it takes. Even the all-girl battle segment is entertaining and shows how much Marvel respects all of its characters no mater how small their role in any movie was. Up until the end, when Endgame shows it's true colors as Infinity war's successor, when it emotionally destroys almost everyone watching the movie. The final demise is the perfect and flawless ending for one of cinema's most recognizable and lovable heroes. The difficulty of his demise is, at this point, unprecedented. Endgame builds itself all the way up to a spectacular and unforgettable climax that resolves itself in just the perfect and (un)wanted way - perfection.2) The acting. Closely connected to the story are the actors that live the characters they are playing. There is no more acting with these people, the literally are those character down to their very core, and we have lived with them. Though better or worse, through all the trials and errors, thought all the sorrow and pain up until the end, when all of their strength combined (not only as characters but as actors and as people) they gave us an end worthy of legends. An ending that should be studied in movie history books and taught as a principle of movie making. The original Avengers, the ones that made comic book heroes real and important, are the ones that will be remembered after this movie. And they should be regarded as the heroes they have played. What hurts the most is the fact that these people really have feelings for each other and in their goodbyes and tears one really feels sorrow and pain. The soul stone segment and the phone call segment are perfect examples of these segments. But the love that bursts from the screen at the: ""You rest now"" scene
and the tears that flow afterwards are not acting. These kind of emotions do not psychologically constitute as acting - they are real and they are powerful. Because of their connection in such a way do the viewers feel and connect so deeply with some of their demises.3) The direction. To keep such a mastodon of a movie at bay and in such a coherent way is truly masterful. The Russo's directed the movie so that three hours feels more like an hour and a half (maybe the quantum theory is true after all). With so much to be told, and to be told with such respect, no ordinary director could have made this the way they did. It is also important to remember that they have directed MCU's finest movies - The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Infinity War, so they have more than enough practice. Henceforth, their balance of character driven story arks and finishing a ten year old story really makes one wonder how such perfection was achieved. Even though the first 20 minutes of the movie feels a bit too rushed with editing being a bit rigorous, the rest of the movie feels incredibly easy and fluent.4) The music. Silvestry actually did not make two soundtracks but used all the important tunes and themes used so far and combined them into something new and powerful. The start of the Endgame battle music feels and sounds like adrenaline being injected right into ones spine, while the eulogy of the godfather of the MCU sound and feels so emotional and powerful that in comparison to the strength felt merely seconds before creates an emotional burst in the viewers unprecedented in modern cinema.All in all, this is a near perfect movie. A flawless, emotional, powerful ride from start to finish. It is unlike anything one has ever seen or felt while watching a movie. Endgame was, is, and always will be one of the best movies ever made. It will remain in movie history as the most important ending to a story and characters beloved by millions. One does not see Endgame, one feels it, breathes it and lives with it. A long, long time will pass before anyone ever makes something even remotely close to the perfection that is Endgame.","8/10"
"matejkaarnost","3 September 2023","I am puzzled why they must put so much action and fights into the movie. It's many times forced and too long and unlikely to happen. First 20 minutes in past are quite ok, classic Nazi point and retrieval of artifacts. Then it goes all down. I would not say it is worse than fourth Indiana Jones, for sure it at least doesn't have Shia LaBeouf, but Helena is not the best character either.Story has its good places and premise, just some dialogues are very simple and dumb. Obviously, they tried to reuse some of successful things from previous movies like having a kid as ""sidekick"" but would not take it as great addition. Ending last 30min is quite stupid. Not to spoil anything, but having a plane and fly so low that it can be hit by catapult and stay in such a hight for whole time is more than idiotic.It's a pity they do not recreate to movie something like Indiana Jones and fate of Atlantis, which is way better story.6/10 just from nostalgia.","7/10"
"Mateo-EGC","22 April 2022","What all the fans were asking for.The return of Bardock together with a 90s style animation was a perfect combination.

"matheusgarces","18 February 2023","Some people will say that Kang is too weak, and that's true (that's a bad part), however, we must remember that only 2 years from now that Kang dynasty will be released, for sure the character Kang will become much stronger. Having said that the film is adventure but not silly, it has jokes as expected from Ant Man, this is not a problem, also Spider man makes jokes and it is not a problem. Kang's story with Jannet is pretty good (one of the best parts of the movie). Jonathan majors acts perfectly. *The film has two post credits scenes in the first one several Kang's appear including Ramatut. In the second scene we have a scene from season 2 of Loki with a version of Kang in the past.","6/10"
"matris1","3 June 2023","The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.","7/10"
"matrixltu","5 February 2021","I don't know why people gave it 10 points. It's a very weak movie once the real action begins on earth. Goku and Vegeta feels very weak. Broly, who only fought bugs and big cats his whole life, is super strong in his normal form, while Goku and Vegeta, who fought the best fighters in whole universe - have big problems even in blue form. Whaaaat? The pace of the poweruping is absolutely unrealistic. It's like the writers skipped 20 episodes and fast-forwarded everything and copy-pasted small bits in-between. Even dialogues were worse than in db-gt during the whole fight. This movie is fun to watch and very well made the first 50 minutes or so and then it turned to utter mess. Nothing made sense. Motivations, powers, pacing, character thought process - very disjointed and childlishly made.
Animations were awesome though. Love the old-school look.","1/10"
"matt_zilla-00996","18 February 2023","After reading some of the reviews, I have to say, I went into the theater with low expectations, but this really delivered and then some, IMO. I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from, especially with people saying the graphics were bad, or that Marvel is only doing ""quantity over quality"" right now, which couldn't be further from reality - people are just complaining to complain.The story line was slow in the beginning, but the rest of the movie was great. This wound up being a great introduction to Kang, and some of the graphics were very captivating. I couldn't be more excited for the upcoming Marvel releases, especially the next phase of Avenger's.","5/10"
"mattgardner-30853","18 January 2024","What a boring film, lacks any excitement, its also depressing to see such an old and depressed Indiana, he just looks like a grumpy harrison Ford from real life. Never go back as they say.This type of film should have stayed in the 80s. I love the originals, they were great for their time. So flogging a dead horse and make new stuff disney.Same old same old. Vague back story, reluctant hero, traveling from country to country, death defying situations, caves, sea and slimy creatures. One min he's an old man who can barely walk, next min he's jumping, punching and swinging from ropes.The lead female is a bad choice for the role, acting is fine but she's just not right for the role, it needed a different acting style and looks to pull off what is essentially an unlikeable chatacter. Personally I find her a bit awkward to watch and don't get the fuss.Didn't like the kid much, he also reminds me of ""One Peice"" to much.He got 25 million for this and you can see he just did it for the money, who wouldn't to be fair. Please make sure no more are made, not even with a new lead, just let the story die with some dignity if that's possible.Honestly it was a struggle to sit through this, wanted to turn off half way through.It's all been done before, even the tomb raider franchise did it better than this.To summarise, give it a miss and watch something else, you will thank me.It's exceptionally boring and has absolutely nothing new to offer.One for hard-core fans at most.","7/10"
"matthewheneghan","4 February 2024","This film grapples with self identity originating from its initial frame. In the opening sequences of the movie the pacing attempts to have you believe that this film will be a broody Statham slaughter extravaganza, in line with others of his repertoire.However, the film soon falls victim to juvenile expositions and shallow, one dimensional characters. Perhaps the worst of them being a brash, young FBI agent Verona Parker. Each time she was featured on screen I couldn't help but feel that the dialogue was penned by high-school students working on a group project.The action sequences are passable, yet nothing inspired or memorable.Overall this movie fails to live up to its fun, adrenaline fuelled thrill-ride its marketed to be.The beekeeper fails to deliver any sweet nuance of action packed fun. For me, this movie is a hard pass. Maybe wait for streaming if you're eager to watch this movie.","7/10"

"matthutsonmovie","26 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the highly anticipated third installment in the Ant-Man series from Marvel Studios. Directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, the film delivers on the humor, action, and visual spectacle that fans have come to expect from the franchise. However it seems like the writers and directors are just mix mashing movies together such as Star Wars, referring to Mos Eisley Cantina scene and all of the various aliens you might encounter and other science fiction flicks which is not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't leave much room for originality.The plot of the film centers around the discovery of a new quantum realm, which leads to a host of new challenges and adventures for the characters. Lang must team up once again with Hope van Dyne/The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) to navigate this new realm and save the world from a new threat.One of the strengths of the film is its cast of characters. The chemistry between Rudd and Lilly is as strong as ever, and their banter provides many of the film's comedic highlights. Douglas also delivers a standout performance as the cantankerous Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer's reasons for hiding the truth from her family were not very well developed or reasoned, while Newton brings a fresh energy to the role of Cassie.The quantum realm sequences are visually stunning and provide a trippy and mind-bending experience for the audience. However the CGI seemed low quality in certain aspects where the suits of Ant-Man and the Wasp looks like they were not even really wearing them, you could totally tell that it was CGI. At certain points it look like the film was trying to be Avatar in terms of visuals yet did not stand up to the quality of it. A plus was the action scenes which were well choreographed and exciting, with the use of size-shifting abilities adding an extra layer of creativity to the fight scenes. The film is not without its flaws.The villain, played by Jonathan Majors, is a pretty badass guy and I felt like he was a good villain for this series yet he seemed quite similar to Thanos in terms of his goals. He has his reasons for doing what he wants to do and I feel like this character could be developed even further. As We Know Marvel is planning to expand on this character because The Kang Dynasty film should be coming to theaters in 2025.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a fun and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It delivers on the humor and action that fans have come to love, while also exploring new territory in the quantum realm. While not without its flaws, the film is a worthy addition to the franchise and is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next adventure of Ant-Man and the Wasp.","7/10"
"mattlewisnati","29 January 2020","The character animation style is amazing! The fights are intense! This movie will keep you captivated for exactly what it was made for, pure DB action and it excels at that.My only complaint is the character power levels.SS Vegeta should have been contested at Broly base. SS2 Vegeta contested at SS Broly. SSG Vegeta being dominant. SSB Vegeta being completely overpowering.SS Goku should have been contested at Broly base. SS2 Goku contested at SS Broly. SS3 Goku being dominant. SSG Goku being completely overpowering.Frieza base should have been contested and dominant with Broly base and SS Broly. Golden Frieza being completely overpowering.To downplay the battle history, experience and power gains of Vegeta, Goku and Frieza is just disrespectful to the whole franchise. And to compare him to the power of Beerus was also disrespectful. Using SSG and SSB for the sake of fan service was out of line. Even we know better.","10/10"
"mattpascoeiow","10 July 2019","A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.","10/10"
"mattstone137","17 February 2023","Another season, another entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth's trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.Quantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It's utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords' pockets with cash.The film follows Scott Lang and company as they're sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel's most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M. O. D. O. K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.The MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it's difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven't been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.The tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.Specifically, Quantumania's story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There's hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes' stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.None of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly...doesn't really have much to do, honestly.Jonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He's a great actor, but not an intimidator - he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn't here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.What else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions.The true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.Take the thought further - hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or (your favorite filmmaker). Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.All a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that.Writing this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme. Either way, blessed release.","8/10"
"MattWillow","14 July 2023","Went into this with pretty low expectations, which at least partly explains why I thought it was quite ok.Of course it had its share of problems. Started out with a digitally enhanced Indy taking on some nazis. Thought the cgi was pretty solid, although the lighting was deliberately low so it was harder to notice the flaws that were still there.The action scenes were fast paced in vintage Indiana Jones fashion. Harrison Ford weren't in most of them, which is understandable but still a shame. Speaking of Ford, at 80 he is still a forceful presence in every scene he's in. A true actor too rarely found these days.As fast paced as the action was, I still got the feeling I was watching a video game large portions of the film.Indys goddaughter sidekick was easily the worst thing about the entire movie. Totally annoying, none of the jokes landed and there was zero chemistry between her and Ford.Mads Mikkelsen was dependable as the adversary.It was good to see Jonathan Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen in a reunion of sorts. Still thought that the ending felt a bit cramped. Could have been done better, but this was ok. Maybe not price of admission ok, but a decent ride into the sunset.","6/10"
"maurodc","17 May 2019","Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anythingPeace!","5/10"
"maxmajorgaming","7 March 2023","Going in I had low expectations. Suffice to say, I enjoyed this movie. The plot was pretty good and had fun, unique ideas. Most of the jokes land and for once I didnt mind the marvel humor. There were some lines of dialogue that were a little 'cringe' and I think the ending should have been way different. Scott Lang didnt get sidelined as much, but I wish it was still focused on him, as he had to share the screen with four other protagonists. I think they did the story well, but it went from a darker tone to a more 'marvel tone' towards the end. Overall, better than most phase 4 projects, and a pretty decent start to phase 5, would recommend.","1/10"

And in this movie they explore Miles and Gwen relationship with each other. And Peter has MJ and a child. And all the characters they can have. There's so much references to The whole spider verse. And this movie lives up to the first one and it might be one of the best animated movie of all times.","10/10"

"mbell-56214","3 February 2024","This is better than many recent Statham movies. It's a fun Saturday popcorn movie than puts no pressure on the brain, but entertains with buckets full of action. Statham does what he does best, keeping the dialogue to a minimum while doing his usual, I can beat anyone persona on full tilt.Is it a sensible movie, no. Is it fun to watch, yes.I do wonder how much longer Statham can keep making movie like this, been 56 years old. But I suspect this movie will be successful enough to spawn at least one more. And if it does I'll be there to watch it, what's not to love about a bit light weight action movie.","8/10"
"mbell-56214","4 May 2023","I really enjoyed the first Ant-man movie and thought the second one was OK, but this is simply very poor and seems in line with all the recent Marvel Universe movies. The script is pretty poor and even for someone quite happy to sit through a no brainer movie, this movie is just boring and lacking any original ideas. The Quantum universe that this is set in looks more like something from Star Wars. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man spends too much of the film totally uninterested until his daughter is in danger, so hardly what you expect from an Avenger. I don't know who is writing for Marvel at the moment, but I think Stan would be turning in his grave at how poor Phase 4 has been. It's got that bad that I'm actually dreading Guardians of the Galaxy.","8/10"

Definitely in my top 5 for the worst movies of the year. I actually take satisfaction that this movie lost money, it might actually get across to the film studio that they can't keep chucking the same rubbish out time and time again unless that have a strong story and are willing to spend whatever is required on the CGI to actually make it look half decent.","6/10"

'The Beekeeper' isn't just a film; it's a masterpiece that blends entertainment with a powerful message, a cinematic gem that could play a crucial role in changing societal perspectives and practices.

"meeza","25 November 2012","The Angular tales are back with another Ang Lee feature. Director Lee is never timid in taking on a wide array of genres when tackling on a movie. And in his latest ""Life of Pi"" he might have just discovered a new genre for motion pictures because Pi serves such themes as adventure, love, courage, man vs. beast, family, religion, regret, friendship, survival, and a few others all in one just movie. ""Life of Pi"" is the most beautiful looking picture of the year, and it will have its Pi I mean eye on the Oscar prize of many technical categories including Best cinematography, sound effects, editing, special effects, and art direction. By the way, the 3-D in this picture is used to its apex. The movie features our protagonist Pi Patel first as an adult telling his incredible teen tale to a journalist, and then it rewinds to flashback in the telling of his unforgettable adventure at sea. Pi's real name is Piscine, so you could imagine how much he was bullied at school due to his name. His father named him Piscine because of his love of pools; but come on bro, out of all the pool of names you could have named your son, why that one? To avoid future name harassment, Pi during his teens, decided to shorten out his name to Pi; an incredible scene in the movie shows Pi in a 3.14 craze demonstrating to his classmates how the Pi equation is calculated in order for them to comprehend that he is now a Pi not a Piscine. Pi's parents live in India and own a farm. When economic problems arise, Pi's father decides to move teen Pi and the family from India to Canada. His plan is to sell the farm (literally) in Canada. To do this, he must first take the family and the animals on a freight ship at sea to Canada. And that is when ""Life of Pi"" transposes itself to a mystical ""survival-at-sea"" flick. A brutal storm causes a shipwreck which Pi bravely survives. Consequently, he is stranded on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Yea, that happened to me also. Anyways, Director Lee carries the picture into a thrilling state of ""young man vs. beast"" for survival. And he brilliantly depicts the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker as the forefront on many of the film's messages about the aforementioned themes. Wait, I must take a break. My cat Douglas Simpson is hungry and I must feed him. OK, that's enough. David Magee's endearing screenplay also deserves an Oscar nod for its relative verbose within Lee's direction. And Ang is a shoe-in for a Best Director Oscar nomination, I must say. Another what should be a sure Oscar nomination is Newcomer Suri Sharma's mesmeric performance as the teen Pi. And Surily I can be serious! Veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan was solid as the adult Pi, but the young Pi Sharma had the more tasty scenes for a thespian showcase. So without a doubt, on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 being excellent), ""Life of Pi"" is not a 4 but much better than a 3.14. ***** Excellent","9/10"

Every new character in MCU(usually it's kids( of Clint and Scott for example)) makes fun of real guys that we know from films before, while being totally brainless childish clowns, that just don't listen to anything. Multiverse saga i believe should extend the lore, make the whole story broader, but it just ended up being the most unbelievable senseless thing thay i've ever saw. P. S. Even before, i would say marvel got cool movies as an exception, big exception( like first Iron Man or Homecoming) but as for now it is literally worse than anyone could've imagined.

From the art style to the perfectly animated fights dragon ball super broly has improved the fights they couldn't in the tv show and now feels more smoother than it was in the tv show.

"mephist-73345","2 March 2023","To be fare, I went into this one with low expectations. I was anticipating something on par with the recent and terrible movies Marvel has been putting out, such as Black Widow, Love and Thunder, Far From Home(yes).I was hoping for something with the same quality as the other Ant-Man movies. For the most part, I think that's what was delivered. The first half is lacking in dialog and feels a bit emotionless. Luckily things improve in the second half of the movie across the board. The scale and pace of the second is notably better. A few of the jokes even managed to land(imo)
TLDR: All in all a fun, light harted adventure. On par with the other Ant-Man movies. Not a top tier Marvel film but not terrible like their recent releases.","6/10"
"mertafor","1 February 2024","There are ""feel good"" movies. You just watch them to put a smile on your face, they make you feel happy. And then, there are movies just make you feel bad. You feel bad because your intelligence rejects such an inferior product. This is a recent trend actually. I seriously don't know how they pick these actors and writers but they deliver the worst material thanks to horrible writing and cringy people. By the way, I'm an action fan and ""mindless action"" is great most of the time as long as it's done right. This is just a John Wick wannabe B movie diguised as an A class thanks to its budget (probably above the average).There is not much to say about Statham, he's doing some of his usual stuff again except he can't bend, jump or do his moves on the floor due to his age. As for the rest of the crew, that FBI lady is in the center of ""feel bad"". I mean useless nosey female law person is a cliche older than me already but her appearance, attitude and style couldn't be cringier than this, zero credibility. At least try to find some actor looks like a government agent for god sake. Her only contribution to the story is to help bringing more people to get wasted by Statham. As for Jeremy Irons, clearly he needed money, maybe that's understable at some extent. I won't even go into other cartoonish villains. Very bad copies of John Wick universe characters.Long story short just stay away from this one. This is not John Wick, Nobody or even Extraction.","4/10"
"Meven_Stoffat","1 December 2012","Let's be honest here: Life of Pi is a pretty looking movie with a rather dismal plot, and a pretentious religious subtext thrown in there for good measure.Life of Pi might not be a bad movie. Realistically it would get maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10, but seeing as there's so many positive reviews here and all of them seem to be from either fanboys of the book, or people who haven't seen very many movies at all, I figured a 1 would be best to balance things out.No doubt the film has some humorous moments that are indeed very funny, like the tiger peeing in Pi's face, Pi's ""rules"", and what not, and the film has tons of pretty visuals. A lot of the film takes place on a boat, and at times it looks like they used a real ocean to film it on. Not to mention the jellyfish scene was pretty, it was almost like James Cameron's Avatar. But... the plot is just so vapid and pretentious, it defies description. Basically, the film throws around a lot of religious references, and it takes up a good portion of the plot, but dear LORD most of the time, the religious references were as subtle as bricks in a drying machine. At times it's like the writers are smacking you across the face with a bible. And when he father asked Pi (as a child) early in the film ""how many more religions are you going to convert to?"" (or something like that), I should have taken that as an indication as how the rest of the movie would be.Oh and the many random moments which included (but weren't limited to): the strange 2:35.1 Aspect ratio change where suddenly a bunch of fish start flying out of the water into the boat (including WINGED fish that seemed like a Michael Bay wet dream), a carnivorous island full of meerkats (though to be fair, the meerkats scene was like a cuteness overdose), and humpback whale bit. Yeah. There were parts of the film I enjoyed, but it honestly was just not a very good movie. It was like eating a platter full of candy and sugary sweets. Lots to indulge in and munch down on, but you've devoured nothing of substance by the end, and you're left with a stomach ache. And throwing a religious subtext in it doesn't mean the film is good or anything... It's just pretentious.So yeah, like I said. Realistically my rating would be a 4 or 5 out of 10, but the 8.4 rating and amounts of 10/10 reviews here is just ridiculous.","9/10"
"MFC9","29 June 2023","The news is very good. Not really an achievement to beat Crystal Skull, but this film smashes it. The opening sequence is sensational, with the CGI at probably 90% realistic vs 70% in Rogue One. It is still, unfortunately, very distracting. Fleabag fans will allow PWB plenty of goodwill, but she is borderline annoying at times. Disney are almost certainly eyeing a franchise for her, no matter what they say. Harrison is in brilliant form and delivers precisely what you expect. Nice Easter Eggs littered throughout and the best villain since Temple of Doom.

"miccosiamesecat","8 May 2013","First off, let me just say that I am NOT some religious nut. I a have seen the twilight movies and probably a bunch of other movies that I shouldn't be watching. I'm an adult and can sift through a movie and take away what I want and watch the rest just for entertainment value, even though I AM a Christian.That being said....this movie takes about five different religions and mixes them all together and basically says, it's okay to believe in anything you want, that everything is ALL the same and you can pick apart different ideas and make your own religion. I found that idea very disturbing and I wouldn't even mention it, except for the fact that they push this super spiritual mixture mess throughout the entire movie. I would have loved this movie if they would of left the spiritual voodoo out of the movie. Make it a simple story of overcoming the odds and finding a bonding relationship with an exotic animal that not many people will ever understand, let alone come that close to. I could believe and even respect that. Some people has special talents and gifts with animals and can understand them in ways most people can't, and the animals reciprocate that back.Enough said about the religious stuff...let me just say that the movie was pretty slow. I know that one of the main characters(aka..the tiger) doesn't have dialogue and so you have to rely on the animals body language to do the talking for you. There was one part towards the end of the movie(don't want to give it away) where I thought I was having an acid trip, the idea was so ridiculous and strange. I know this is supposed to be a deep spiritual and slightly(and I emphasize slightly) philosophical type movie, but that wasn't what I was expecting to get out of this movie and towards the end, it just got ridiculous. Not to mention, I hated the way things ended up with the boy and the tiger and the ending of the actual movie was very boring and anticlimactic.I like deep...deep thoughts, ideas...I can do deep in my sleep, but this movie was just weird on every level and is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This COULD have been a really great movie if they would of kept it simple...boy bonds with tiger and overcomes all odds...no mumbo jumbo wonky stuff.That's my two cents anyway...","9/10"
"Michael_Elliott","26 November 2012","Life of Pi (2012) **** (out of 4) Ang Lee's incredible tale of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), a teenage Indian boy who survives a ship sinking that kills everyone on board except for himself and a tiger. Soon the two are on board a lifeboat not knowing what their future holds. I had never heard of the novel that this film is based on and I had absolutely no idea what the film was about until about five months prior I saw a promotional piece while waiting to watch another movie. I actually went back to work joking about the picture because I couldn't believe anyone would try and make a movie about a boy, a tiger and a lifeboat but the joke is on me because Lee has created one of the more memorable, magical and uplifting films of the year. I was really shocked to see how tremendous the picture was but what makes it so special would have me giving away countless spoilers, which is something I'm certainly not going to do. I think it would be best for viewers to go into the picture knowing as little as possible but I can say that Lee has created one of the most beautiful pictures you're likely to see. The beautiful images are just so remarkable to look at that it's impossible not to get caught up in the scenery. Be it the early stuff in India or the breathtaking moments at sea, everything in this picture just lights up the screen. I'm really not a fan of CGI unless it's used properly. Too many times I think it's just used to be lazy and save money but that's not the case here as Lee perfectly mixes in the CGI with the live action stuff. The two coming together are practically flawless and that certainly helps bring one closer to the story and characters. Sharma does a terrific job and especially when you consider he'd never acted before and was basically having to carry the entire film. I was a little mixed on the 3D effects. While some where brilliant, for the most part I think the film would be viewed just fine in 2D as it would give one better colors. Still, no matter which version you see, the heart of the picture is in its soul, its character and the lessons he learns while being stuck out at sea for over two hundred days. LIFE OF PI is a really remarkable film that has so much going for it that it's clearly one of the year's best.","8/10"

"michael-a-meier","31 January 2024","This movie contains - maybe too intentional - all reknown Indiana-Jones elements and consists of car chases magic artifacts, insects, strong women and journeys around the world. The story has no real surprises, this could have been done better.What really bothers me is the portrayal of old men and women in some important Hollywood movies. Why do they have to be disillusioned, kind of messed up elders? This is neither worthy of a figure like Indiana Jones, nor of Luke Skywalker and yet, there it is. For me, the whole settng of Indys Life in the sixties (appartment, university, relations) is kind of depressing. It´s a shame, George Lucas would definatly have done better. Indiana Jones could have gotten some wisdom, or maybe some relaxed charm like his movie father Sean Connery. In ""Shrinking"", you can see Harrison Ford more like that.","10/10"
"michael-desmond-4-644971","11 July 2017","I write this review in the hopes of stopping people wasting their time and money on this terrible movie. It was boring, cliché, predictable and drawn out to the point that I was hoping for it to end. I have no idea how this movie got such a high score and it honestly makes me suspicious. I was with two other people who agreed that this was one of the worst movies they had ever seen.","9/10"
"michael-kerrigan-526-124974","20 October 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes. Thought it would be a 6 like the other two in the trilogy. They were very watchable but not a touch on the originals. This last one in the trilogy was by far the best. Just the right amount of action (i.e not much) and enough anti-war sentiment and human/ape emotion to give it a thoroughly enjoyable 8 out of ten.
Second watch 4 years later......
Just watched war for the planet of the apes for the second time. Last saw it at cinema and gave it 8 then. This time I watched it at home on a 4K monitor. An absolute visual delight underpinned by a tense and tender 'human' drama. Absolutely brilliant - 9 out of ten","5/10"
"michaelarmer","1 March 2020","Strangely enough, and a reversal of trends this second sequel to Rise of The Planet of the Apes is the best film ! The first - Rise......oTPoTA was good but not great, the 2nd Dawn.......oTPoTA was a bit better, and this is very good, can't wait to see what the next is like.The reason it is so good, it is well directed and has some serious drama, the CGI is getting better and the acting was great. The photography was excellent with beautiful scenery and good sets. It was a bit long and dragged a little in the middle, but not by much, and not enough to lower the rating, for the most part it was paced very well. It was the story and screenplay that was the best, the extra impact of the virus was interesting, as was the relationship of the different characters. All in all a very good watch.Ignore all the negative reviews on here, we all know that the world is full of idiots, and a thousand of them must have registered on here! If you are only interested in flash bang films, don't watch and ignore this review, but if you want to view an excellent, well made film, with serious drama and a great story, this might be your cup of tea.","1/10"

"michaelhowell12","2 September 2019","This film is way better than endgame!
The actions better
The writings better
The dialogues better
The cgi is better
More shocks and more emotional.
Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.
I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!
But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","10/10"
"michaelRokeefe","9 January 2018","This is the third chapter of the acclaimed Planet of the Apes franchise. Matt Reeves directs and this episode that is nice on the eyes to watch. Enough activity to keep your interest and story line that moves along at a good pace for a two hour twenty minute movie.Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his apes are goaded into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a devious, head-strong Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Caesar tangles with his inner, dark instincts and comes to grips with his own mythical stature avenging his own kind. He comes face to face with the Colonel as bitter challengers in a battle that will determine the fate of both species. Ape versus Man and the future of the planet.Really impressive is Steve Zahn playing Bad Ape. Also in the cast are: Amiah Miller, Judy Greer, Aleks Paunovic, Karin Konoval, Toby Kebbell and Michael Adamthwaite.","9/10"
"michaeltong-29180","8 August 2019","Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.","10/10"

"michvanbeek","10 August 2023","Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse dates back to 2018. The film was received extremely positively by friend and foe and rightly so. And such an animated film with a sublime animation style was something that had never been seen before on this scale. Like going to a comic book that was translated on screen and with a very, very good story. It may take five years for the sequel, but patience pays off and how. It seemed a fairly tough task in advance to be able to surpass Into the Spider-Verse, but this has absolutely succeeded in every area. Where the regular Marvel movies have fallen into disrepair, where the quality of those movies has gone up and down, the Spider-Verse movies are definitely not and maybe it's better for Marvel to focus on these gems than again for the umpteenth time to bring some weak and much too expensive live action film into the cinemas that are destroyed by the media and the public.The story is enriched by deepening the backgrounds of, for example, Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales and that really works out perfectly. Why mention Gwen first? That's simple, the story around Gwen really worked out best in this movie. The opening of the movie might make you think ok, I hope it really gets a lot better than this, but this feeling will go away very soon. The origin of Spider-Man's enemy Spot is beautifully worked out. At first it seems like a funny and above all clumsy figure who has absolutely no control over his powers. When it finally becomes clear who Spot is and what his ultimate intentions are, Gwen comes back into the picture with Miles, but it is not yet clear why. Until Miles finds out that all universes are connected and that Gwen turns out to be a key that brings Miles to the Spider-people, led by Miguel O'Hara. This all sounds very dull, but the story seems to have a really hypnotic effect and that is where the strength of the film lies.With a running time of almost two and a half hours, it might stop people from taking a quick look at the film, but the running time is justified. Where Into the Spider-Verse still felt like the best, which strangely enough was still kept under two hours, that is really different with this film. With Into the Spider-Verse it was in a chaotic and almost impossible to follow color explosion called the ending. This is really different in Across the Spider-Verse. The entire film is expertly worked out, with the story only leaving you wanting more. Obviously this is because the open ending is just a cutoff in the middle of the story, but that's not the only thing. The coming together of every Spider-Man in history and more also builds up to more than just confronting Spot. Of course we could dedicate an entire review to how beautiful the animation is, but this was of course already very clear after the first part. The different animation styles are mixed in this film with a number of other surprises that not only bring you to the drawn or animated Spider-Man, but much more.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse surpasses its predecessor in every way and raises the bar for a sequel. Not only the animation is fantastic, but also the story is perfectly worked out. Perhaps with Across the Spider-Verse we had the best Spider-Man movie yet and that really promises something for the sequel. It is especially the depths of Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales that add considerable force to the film. The threat coming from enemy Spot is really good and the part where Miles joins the Spider-people is really well done. The playing time of almost two and a half hours is strangely enough still a bit on the short side, but good. That is not surprising in this case, because the film ends in the middle of the story, so there is still plenty to do. The movie has been in theaters for a while and for those who haven't seen the movie in theaters yet, do yourself a favor and just go there.","9/10"
"Micke_Eriksson","12 October 2023","I was very disappointed with this. I was soaking it in as the story went along, the details left & right, and starting to figure out what the end would be like (I'm not pointing out what I'm referring to, so that I don't spoil it for anyone), just like with the previous installments.They mention or speak about a specific thing, its uses, why or how they would do a certain thing, and somehow thanks to clever (and often predictable) writing, it was where the story was heading.However, this was not the case and I was very annoyed when the movie suddenly and abruptly ended on an unsung note, on a road not traveled, and the movie ended just as bad as it had started with non-status quo.The action was as good as could be expected, partially because of the character Indy & his bad (?) luck, and with his age accounted for, so it was good. It's just the ending that really annoyed me. At least The Last Crusade had a nice ending, of which I was expecting something similar in this one...
One could only pray that they've got some alternate extended Directors Cut-ending coming on Bluray where they change the ending completely and make it right.I was really looking forward to this movie since it was announced, but it was a huge disappointment thanks to this.I rated this 6 out 10, and I gave one of those points for the action-scenes for the first 80% of the movie, for Indy's spunk, the rest was so that it would average (There are worse movies after all!).","7/10"
"mickeythechamp","19 May 2023","I am literally baffled. I have always been a marvel sceptic, that I have never hidden. I have always thought some MCU movies could at time be nothing more than mindless action and that´s fine, that just doesn't get high ratings from me. I have my bottom MCU films like everyone else, but this, this is the new low. This is one of the most soulless movies I have ever watched and while it didn't infuriate me as other of my lowest ranked movies did, this one just left me without a single feeling in my body. This phase of the MCU has been disappointing on so many levels and delivered the one bad to mediocre movie after another, but I have now seen the low point where the light doesn't shine, where pure numbness exist and Marvel finally became nothing more than colors and sounds from your TV and nothing more.Scott Lang, now not really doing anything with his life is confronted by his daughter who has made a device that can enter the quantum realm again. Janet tries to stop them from activating the device, but the entire Van Dyne family is dragged into the Quantum realm. They most now find a way while avoiding the evil overlord of the quantum realm, Kang.What really sets me off about this movie is the lack of care, lack of good storytelling but mostly lack of a soul. This is a movie that feel fully AI generated where anyone could have written it and it uses so many basic tropes, clichés and basic story devices it´s painfully obvious you are just watching a movie. I was never sucked in, never cared for anything or anyone and I was just watching colorful screens and hearing noises instead of watching a movie. There was nothing here for me to get me engaged and when I pretend care more for a character with a lamp for a head than any of our mains and villains, that's a bad thing. At least other Marvel movies were just poorly written or infuriatingly written where you get some emotions, here, nothing.The characters aren't really characters here. They are vessels for the storytelling and nothing more. They don't do anything, barely have arcs, and barely represent humans. They act and feel like written robots just moving from A to B and dose whatever the movie wants them to do. Once again, the soullessness shows itself. Antman feels barely like himself. His family are just there, and the title character Wasp are barely in the movie. The balancing of the 5 different main characters isn't there and we never get to connect with any of them. The new characters are also just here and when the villain MODOK has more of a character arc than any of our main characters that's a problem.You have heard about it but it really is that bad. The effects are so terrible in this movie. We are given an entirely new world to explore, but none of it has any impact because it´s just like brown and because they do the green screen trick, out of focus. I want to see what´s going on in the background, I want to see the quantum realm. But I´m given nothing but blur. The problem with that is I can only see this movie as characters standing up against a wall trying to act. The visual medium that movies are, are not utilized at all here, it´s just person one, talking to themselves against a brown wall of blur. It´s embarrassing to watch. MODOK looks like absolute garbage with nothing more than a stretchtool used and in general everything just looks so underwhelming.The quantum realm doesn't really fell like it makes any scenes at all. It actually feels like an asset flip with random characters and creatures just being here because why not. I don't understand the world and never felt in awe over how it worked because it´s just a normal town with random characters thrown into it.This movie is split into two separate storylines that are kind of just mushed together in the end because that's what´s supposed to happen. The lack of character and the terrible dialogue leaves none of the two stories interesting and compelling.I have to talk about this terrible script. It is clearly someone's first and you might think that you should cut it some slag then. Well to me, that's no excuse when your 30 something movies in to a franchise, this is where you get the big guns. The plot is clearly an executives clip notes as to what is spoused to happen in the movie and the rest is plastered together with mushy tropes, clichés and writing 101. The dialogue is not how real people talk, it´s whatever is need to be said to move the movie forward and give foreshadowing. The characters have to act like absolute morons in order to make the movie work. Why has Janet not told anyone about Kang before? Why isn't she informing her family at all? It´s infuriating that the characters don't act like humans and are forced to act badly in order to make the movie have surprises. None of the actors can really pull of the stilted robotic dialogue and the acting in general is not good here. I think Jonathan Majors dose the best job here, until the end credit scene rolled around.The humor doesn't really land for the most part for me. Every kind of humor is thrown at the wall so eventually something will land. Random equals funny, dragged out things, word play so on so forth.But this was an introduction to a big bad and to be honest, I´m not afraid. Ant man can win against him, his not a thread. His motivation is also so vague it hurts and I hope we get more of a motivation from him later. This was just a movie to tell you ""hey, this guy is a thing"" and that's all it does. The movie really has nothing going for it and the character arcs are not important and barely done at all. Everything is package in such a cookie cutter way that it hurts to watch.I know I have rambled a lot and it sounds like I have a lot of emotions, but the funny part is, I don't. I feel nothing for this movie and it´s one of the movies where I just felt like I just wasted X amount of time of my life. I wasn't moved or was asked to feel any emotions what so ever and once again it was nothing more than colors and noises from my TV.","1/10"
"mickr7an","8 February 2024","Goofy villains undercut Statham's performance as a tough guy in a silly over the top action flick. We've seen it before, retired tough guy pulled out of his quiet life, whether he be a beekeeper or a gardener or a bricklayer, for personal reasons to show his human side. Im willing to go along with the action trope and as a recent convert to a Statham fan thanks to Guy Richie I'm reminded why I was not a fan originally. I like his performance but the quality of the storylines and directing are often a letdown. In a misguided attempt to create a fast moving stylised action movie the director has produced a mismatch of tone and intention.","6/10"
"micz81","6 February 2024","This such a disastrous piece of crap, that it is hard for me to comprehend how on earth somebody could willingly put their names on the posters. Jeremy Irons is - sadly - one of those people. But, at the same time he is the only reason to stay till the end of the screening. Lousy writing, awful acting (especially ""female lead"" who should rather stay at doing commercial or soap operas if she cannot deliver solid performance in such an easy role in such a low aspiring movie - every time she is on the screen I cringe like an old avocado), even the lighting feels cheap and color correction looks like straight out from After Effects.In short: this is just yet another John Wick clone and let us remember that John Wick itself is at most mediocre level of entertainment.","8/10"
"miguelneto-74936","16 August 2017","The closing of this trilogy could not have been better, War for the Planet of the Apes closes the trilogy with key and manages to be the best one of the trilogy also, not only one of the best films of the year, but also one of the best of this decade, the trilogy Modern Planet of the Apes is one of the best trilogy I've ever seen, War for the Planet of the Apes starts already frenetic with a very good action scene, and we begin to better understand what goes on the screen, the plot is very good, But he does have a few forced scenes, but that does not hinder development, Ceasar is one of the most well-developed characters of the last year, and that owes much to Andy Serkis who embodied the character, and in my opinion he deserves a lot of Oscar, I hope the academy sees this, the direction is again of Matt Reeves who directed the previous one and he does a great direction, Woody Harrelson does an excellent job as the Colonel, he is a great and bad and has good motivation The CGI is amazing, the Monkeys are very well done, the movie even with several sad moments it is has several fun and funny moments, but the jokes are very well placed, the soundtrack is great, the dialogues are very good, The film hits the dramatic moments and the ending is satisfying.

"mihai_alexandru_chindris","31 May 2017","Everything I've seen in this movie is absolutely perfect. From the beginning to the end. The actors had flow and genuineness in movements and speech, not to mention that the stunning visual effects contributed in such a tremendous way to the story itself. It reminds me of a Romanian dramatic parable, Iona, but instead of the character being eaten by multiple fishes, talking to himself and losing his inner soul, here we face the opposite, a young and brave boy who gets over any difficulty and who finds his true identity in life by overcoming forces that are not of his league. I truly recommend it to anyone, because it brings joy to the soul and peace to the mind.","8/10"
"mike_brunton","9 October 2017","There is an alarming trend in Hollywood, think if you throw 150 million dollars at a film, it has to be good! War was the most misleading title I have ever seen. I stopped watching this drek after 1 hour. 1 hour of my life wasted. Knowing incredibly there was still over an hour to go. And for what? The whole Caesar ends up in a concentration camp with his Apes could have been done in 30 minutes and hey presto! The movie could have been 1 and a half hours of more concise story-line. I saw other people saying the writers had copied other films and I agree. The whole Caesar sets out to find the Colonel and kill him picking up 2 sidekicks along the way Lord of the Rings and another thousand movies. By the time I stopped watching, I couldn't care for the Apes or the humans. Caesar especially became more and more annoying. The first part of the movie the attack by Special Forces annoying, after 15 years most of the Apes still carry spears. Despite being able to climb trees easily and post sentries, the humans still crept up on their base. And how were they wiped out, by a sudden storm of hundreds of perfectly arced spears falling into their midst. Looking back most of the movie was boring and annoying, it's a real shame because I enjoyed movies one and two. And as other people have said, how on Earth did this get a rating of 8 out of ten? Even with lovers, this movie doesn't deserve more than a 6 out of ten. Once again, the majority of 100 IQ reviewers misled me into watching drek designed for people of 100 IQ and less. Are humans just Apes?","7/10"
"Mike_Devine","30 July 2023","After more than 40 years of hearing the iconic theme by John Williams, Harrison Ford dons the famed fedora one last time as he searches for another ancient relic; this time, it's the 'Dial of Destiny.'Yes, Indy can be accused of being washed up in his final globetrotting adventure, but it's still cool to see Dr. Jones go on another wild ride here. For starters, Phoebe Waller-Bridge plays an excellent sidekick in goddaughter-turned-pirate Helena, as she finds a way to bring out the best curmudgeon-y one-liners from Indy. It's also noteworthy that we see the titular character once again battle the Nazis, who are the most formidable and fearsome villains he ever faces (Mads Mikkelsen portrays a particularly sinister Dr. Voller here).While it's easy to pin 'Dial' above the heaping wreck that was 'Crystal Skull,' this only gets the film so far. For one, it's a whopping 154 minutes - an Odyssey by this franchise's standards - and feels every minute as long as this. There's also the ridiculousness of the plot - did anyone have ""time travel"" on their IJ bingo card (although, to be fair, probably no one had ""aliens"" on their cards 15 years ago...)?There are plenty of times throughout 'Dial' that Indy feels like he's just being dragged around from location to location, more of a passenger than a driver, and of course his age has a lot to do with this. Still, the opening sequence is perhaps one of the better ones this franchise has done, and James Mangold deserves credit for taking the risk on this given how flat it could have fallen if the technology hadn't lived up to its potential.No, it's not in the same league as 'Raiders' or 'Crusade,' but this film is fun enough to send Indiana Jones into the sunset on a mostly okay note.","7/10"

"mikocot","11 May 2018","I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased.I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures.Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","10/10"
"milleniumlogan","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","3/10"
"MiloSuperSpesh","5 February 2024","Dumb cringey bad guys trying to justify being bad guys is the order of the day, so if you love my previous mentioned comparisons you'll have an idea of what to expect.This movie is classic jason statham, his moves and prowess is on full display with minimal cut aways and stunt standins.Jason shows gun play close to keanu's and fighting off henchman like alan ritchinson's reacher.Acting- acceptable for most for what they had to work with, others are plain annoying ( head of the call centers and random pmc / henchmen, and oh boy the state of the blond highlighted foreign merc in a yellow jacket), Josh hutcherson goes for a less is more chill vibe, and jeremy irons just oozes coolness has he takes control of the situation.Music tries to be a unique flavour emmulating john wicks score fits well but isn't memorable.Effects - strictly mid nothing special or fancy just what is needed and does the job.Stunt work - quite alot of embelishment in perps flying around from kicks and explosions.Fights are pretty good with some really nice set pieces.Enjoy!","5/10"

"MimiChen","8 March 2023","I had fun watching it, but I knew that I needed to leave my brain at the door. That being said it seems less of an Ant Man movie, but more of a how many ways can we get great shots of Michelle Pfeiffer? By the way, she looks great and I wish I had her plastic surgeon.I loved a lot of the special effects. It seems they went all out so if you go to see this movie, it is a must see in the theaters. To me, nowadays, the only reason to go see a movie in a theater is just because the special effects are incredible to see and appreciate!All in all it was a fun ride, so please don't go overboard on trying to analyze it. It's not that kind of movie.","4/10"

"MiroslavKyuranov","15 February 2023","""Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania"" is a psychedelic science fiction rollercoaster full of frightening and hilarious surprises, but don't overstay your welcome in the Quanatum realm too much, because Kang is watching every step of yours!""Quantumania"" is a good start to Phase 5 and you can see the future trajectory of the MCU and where it goes. It's exciting for sure! It works better as a first chapter of ""The Kang Dynasty"", than a third movie in a franchise, but this is not a bad thing, because if you're there for Kang, you will enjoy the heck out of this movie.Jonathan Majors effortlessly conquers every second of screen-time he gets. He is charismatic, intense and brutal and his presence is felt among everybody else. The dynamic between Scott and Cassie is the heart of the movie, but it feels like something is missing, just like Scott wasn't there for Cassie. We don't see how she become a hero too, which is strange. Also the character of Ant-Man stays in the shadow of Kang in his own movie. The rest of the cast is just fine, maybe standing a bit more out is kick-ass Michelle Pfeiffer.The comedy is there and it hits most of the time, but this one is not as funny as the previous two movies for sure, there are some huge stakes. The Quantum realm looks really good, particularly some scenes, just captivating visually. There are other things that are just weird, but in a good way. Most of them works pretty fine.The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is good.For sure this is the biggest of the three films in scale, but I think the small scale was the mark of the ""Ant-Man"" franchise, now it feels like some of the hearth of the movie is missing.It is a good mid tier MCU movie and with the proper expectations you gonna enjoy it. I was hyped for Kang and got what I want.The idea to put the tiniest Avenger versus the biggest, baddest villain in the MCU is ambitious and it pays off well for the future projects. There are two credit scenes, both very important and you don't want to miss them!","6/10"
"MiroslavKyuranov","25 April 2018","This is...I literally got no words after this movie.This is the most epic movie you'll ever seen. You will cry from pleasure, you will cry from epicness and you will definitely cry from heartbreaking scenes. Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE!I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain!The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible.The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world.Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.On purpose I do not want to give you absolute any spoilers. I want you to enjoy the movie by yourself. I believe any real fan will be happy with the result of ten years gradation and like me, will got no words.","1/10"
"MiroslavKyuranov","31 May 2023","It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.","10/10"
"mirsath737","3 February 2024","A bit of a John Wick wannabe, I thought it leapt a bit in terms of timeframe, and ultimate end game. However, despite all that, quite watchable. The characters were good, their parts executed as you would want them to be (no stand outs) the story was predictable and did not shy away from the craved action or relentlessness that makes a good revenge movie. Some excellent action sequences that will satisfy most enthusiasts. The end left it quite open for a sequel, though could quite easily end there. Jason Statham at his usual kick ass best, if you like his usual style of movies, you will love this as well.","10/10"
"mirwais-orbit","17 December 2019","There's a moment in one of Scream franchise openings that a girl makes a comment about the Stab franchise (the movie series within the movie). She says that even Stab series used time traveling because that's what they do when there's nothing else to tell.Funny enough, some of the Avengers makes a quite similar observation when Ant Man comes with this cliche idea. That was exactly the moment that I did remember that quote from Scream. And I couldn't expect anything different from that on.Infinity War was an amazing movie, first because it gave us all the feeling that heroes can fall, and villains can be more than just bad guys without purpose.Thanos is a villain because he was created that way, but his vision about the world and universe are unique and makes sense in his mind. When he snap his fingers and random people start disappearing, Infinity War made its point.At first, Infinity War was to be a movie divided in two parts, and the second part being the consequences and resolutions about the world after Thanos. A new era was about to be born, but suddenly it was stated that the 4th movie wouldn't be that way anymore.After finally watching Endgame, the reasons for that changes are very clear to me.First thing is that most of the fans couldn't stand the fact that some heroes have died, so writers had to think about a differet resolution to please them. Second is that Marvel failed to use it as an element of surprise to Endgame.What we see during 3 hours is an empty movie struggling to keep the pace of an entire cinematic universe created throughout a decade.As a whole, Endgame is only a redone version of Infinity War, and not exactly a follow up as it might seems. The consequences and resolutions are redundant when compared to the tragic ending of previous one. And yes, the time travelling plot was nothing else but a comfort zone to retell a story in a simpler way for the sake of a true ending.So, the clueless girl from Scream was right.Endgame had much more to tell than the way it was done. The plot development could have had dozen of different paths, and each one would have been much more interesting and still satisfying.I really don't understand how this movie became the biggest box office in history, because together with Age Of Ultron, is the weakest movie of the entire saga and entire MCU.","6/10"
"Mischief810","3 July 2023","Worth the ticket price, but still not up to Indiana Jones standards. Granted, this is a very high bar but this film doesn't seem to make much of an attempt to reach it.I frankly believe that Phoebe Waller-Bridge was the wrong actress for this part. Ms. Waller-Bridge simply cannot abandon the sarcastic, quirky characters she has played since forever. She's not dreadful here, but neither does she click like Karen Allen in Raiders or Kate Capshaw in Temple. I also believe that the development of the relationship between Helena and Indy is better suited as part of a post-Indy straight-to-streaming drama flick. It's just out of place here.Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as a bad guy. The fact that his performance exceeds that of the leading man and leading lady is telling.I cannot be the only film lover who has noticed that the Disney Co. Has done little to improve the quality of Lucas content. It feels like the franchises born in the 1970's and 80's are now just being milked for revenues while the corporate office insures that it scores political popularity points. The quality of the art suffers when the art is no longer created for the art's sake.I do still think the movie is worth the ticket price but it really could have been so much better.","9/10"
"MissSimonetta","27 April 2019","To clarify, I am not an MCU fangirl. I enjoy these movies a little more than the casual moviegoer but I definitely do not fit into the diehard category. I enjoy watching most of the films, but would only list the GOTG movies and THOR: RAGNAROK as personal favorites.So just know, this isn't coming from the perspective of some unpleasable geek. It's coming from someone who was emotionally invested in these movies, enjoys most of them, and prizes solid storytelling.And let me tell you, as a story, ENDGAME is a mess.Character development? Forget it! Thor's arc from selfish braggart to responsible king is thrown away so he can be Lebowski 2.0, complete with sunglasses and sweater. The Hulk and Peter Quill are pretty much jokes. Tony Stark gets one of the cheapest deaths in modern cinema-- it feels less like a natural culmination of the character's growth and more like RDJ wanted to make sure he wasn't shoehorned into more movies through 2050.And don't get me started on how the events of this film are going to wreck GOTG 3. Let's just say all Gamora's character development is in the trash now. I know plenty of people who love the GOTG movies but have no interest in any other Marvel property and they'll be confused as hell come 2021. (I really do not get people who claim these MCU films work as self-alone pictures. 9.5 times out of 10, they really don't at all.)ENDGAME continues the trend of CAPTAIN MARVEL in throwing continuity to the winds. What happened to Thor's hammer NOT being the source of his power? Now, Steve Rogers can use it to toss lighting everywhere like a rogue Pikachu. Peter Parker goes back to high school in 2023 and somehow Ned is still a teen attending--- even though he was one of the confirmed not-deaths after INFINITY WAR. Steve Roger's wild time travel ride at the end will also screw future timeline continuity up in ways I shudder to contemplate. I pity the screenwriters is all I gotta say.I won't say this movie is the worst. Compared to something like, say, THE LAST JEDI, which had the most formless, meandering plot, ENDGAME moves quickly and does not overstay its welcome. There are some truly fun fight scenes and one-liners. The final battle in particular is marvelous, giving me some of the most fun I've had in a theater in a while (though it could have just been the enthusiasm of the crowd working its magic on me).But I'm not going to pretend this is an epic finale. It was so unsatisfying a conclusion for the original Avengers team that it kind of taints what came before. What enthusiasm I had for the MCU to come wasn't exactly high (nothing good lasts forever, as many a former successful franchise has shown Hollywood time and time again), but now, my hopes are nil.EDIT: I found out that Thor's hammer does allow worthy wielders his power, so I rescind my ""rogue Pikachu"" complaint. The movie is still frustrating though.","7/10"
"mistramicizia","29 June 2018","Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers","1/10"
"mitchell5954","17 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is the third installment of this reboot POTA trilogy, though there could easily be more. This is a series of films that I initially didn't care, but grew to really enjoy. The first film, Rise, I still think is just okay. It's definitely not bad, but I find it heavily overrated. However, the second movie, Dawn, I love, and think is vastly superior to its predecessor. The effects, story, and characters are all better, and the dynamic between Caesar and Koba is just brilliant. So I was hyped for this movie before it came out. Does it live-up to the hype? Yes.I still think Dawn is the best of the movies, but this is definitely a worthy sequel and final installment of this franchise, or at least this portion of it. This has been an interesting trilogy. Usual in these big franchises the first movie is good, the second is just as solid, if not better, and the third installment is the weakest. In this case the first film is the weakest, the second is best, and the third is really good. The only other trilogy I know that has played out like this has been the Captain America trilogy.The end of Dawn set-up the final war between the humans and the apes. War takes place a couple years after Dawn where the apes are trying to find a way out of the forest and into a new land where they can call home. Before he can do that though Caesar seeks revenge against Woody Harrelson's character, the Colonel. The first half is essentially a journey of revenge for Caesar, and the second is an escape movie.This film does almost everything right. The effects are stunning. Dawn is overall a better film to me, but when it comes to the effects War takes the cake. People raved about Rise's effects when it came out. War makes the effects in that look almost amateurish.Caesar remains the best part of this franchise (along with Koba). He's an amazing character, and has come so far from his humble beginnings in Rise. If you come into this movie wanting constant action you will be disappointed on that front. The title and trailers are a bit misleading. This is more of a dreary drama for Caesar and the apes with some action in the beginning and end.The first and third acts are amazing, especially act one. The first act feels like a dreary post-apocalyptic film like The Road. It's moody, dark, and very atmospheric with minimal music. The music used enhances the dreary atmosphere. The third act confrontation is also great. Possible spoiler; the very end reminded me of the ending to Exodus in the Bible. I get the feeling that was intentional. It was a good way to wrap-up Caesar's story.There are a couple issues I have that prevent this from being a perfect movie. Firstly, the second act, with the apes imprisoned, did drag on a bit too long in my opinion. It was still good, and there were some good interactions with the humans and apes, to be honest there were times where I got a little bored and was waiting for some real progression. In Dawn I was never bored. Each scene in that film was engaging and felt necessary. They also threw-in some humor that didn't quite work. Fortunately, there was not much of that.They also threw in a new ape character who was basically the comic relief, but he didn't annoy me that much. Also, his presence provided the main character, and by extension the audience, with some interesting world building.Lastly the villain, Woody Harrelson, while good, was a disappointment. This is mainly because both the trailers and the film itself hyped this guy up to no tomorrow to be Caesar's ultimate nemesis, but he really wasn't. Koba is still the best villain in this franchise (and one of my favorite villains period). On a side note I liked how Koba is both in the film and not in it at the same time. I really liked how the film utilized Koba, which is what drove Casear's arc in this.The colonel was still a decent villain who you can understand his motivations, and Woody Harrelson gives a good performance, but he was ultimately nothing. I do like the twist the film did with the virus, which ties into the ending with the colonel, but it still felt a bit anticlimactic given the hype.Overall, War for the Apes was a satisfying conclusion to the Caesar trilogy. If you liked the previous two installments this one won't disappoint. The thing is, even though this trilogy is done, they could easily make many more films and play in this universe, much like Star Wars, if they wanted. I have a feeling they will too.","10/10"
"mithil293","22 November 2012","According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book of same title.Piscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn't go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??","7/10"
"mitrapourmand","14 May 2018","We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","10/10"

"MJB784","2 July 2023","Good news: I enjoyed Indiana Jones 5. It was entertaining with good action scenes and humor. The story was well written, too. Indy is trying to find the other half of a teleportation device after his previous partner split it apart so Nazis wouldn't find it. The device was created by Archemedies in ancient times and looks like a giant, rusty compass. Bad news: It went on too long. Some of it dragged. The partners weren't as interesting as Miriam or Willie Scott or Short Round; except the first partner in the opening 25 minutes. The opening was the best part of the movie and really felt like the early classics. So, it's my third favorite of the series. First and second still the best.","4/10"
"mjbakker-72764","17 November 2023","Saw it, didn't like it. Typically Disney.Why does Disney want to destroy all good franchises.First the theme parks, then Starwars, then Marvel, now Indiana Jones.Aren't the sales numbers enough for Disney to make them realize that this is not working?The movie is literally destroying Indiana, to make place for this Wombat, that seriously has the charisma of what i found in the toilet this morning.Not that his so called son is taking over, no he was conveniently killed in some war.Well all in all, Disney is going to stop the franchise anyway because they lost like 100/200 million dollars on this one and it was well deserved.At least it will die a silent death and if we forget this one and remember Harrison in the first 4 movies, then Indiana Jones will still be a legacy.Btw, what was wrong about the idea to give Harrison the same treat as Sean Connery got. At least they gave him respect and an awesome role in the 3rd movie.Ah forgot, that was under Spielberg and not some narcissistic director from Disney.Also people giving high ratings to this movie are lying. Look at how many millions this movie lost, that was not because it was misjudged or misunderstood, it was just because it was not an Indiana Jones movie anymore.","8/10"
"mjd8959","13 June 2023","People who are saying that they can't like this movie because it ends in a cliffhanger are silly. Plenty of books and pieces of media that are objectively and subjectively enjoyable end with cliffhangers. It's interesting because some of the people who complain about this film ending the way it did also are giving praise to Empire Strikes Back- a movie that ended in a cliffhanger. There doesn't need to be conclusion to a film to enjoy it and have fun. There's a lot of character growth, a good story, a lot of interesting ideas and the art direction is beautiful and revolutionary. There's plenty in this film to satisfy movie goers and fans alike.","10/10"
"mjpiro","18 May 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the story of a family that gets transported to the Quantum Realm and spends a majority of the movie trying to defeat Kang the Conqueror, played nicely by Jonathan Majors (Creed III), who controls the alternate reality and escape from it!! Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania stars funnyman Paul Rudd (Ghostbuster: Afterlife) as Scott Lang with his superhero alias as Ant-Man, an Avenger who is coming fresh off a victory with some of the Avengers, saving the entire world and is feeling pretty good about it in the beginning part of this film!! Also starring in this movie is Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost) who plays Hope Van Dyne with her superhero alias as The Wasp having the ability to fight and fly with great power and speed when she has her wasp suit on. Michael Douglas (Wall Street) as Dr. Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns) as Janet Van Dyne, and Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang all round out the top members of this cast as members of an extended family. It is at Dr. Pym's house where the group accidentally gets beamed to the Quantum Realm and spend a majority of the movie fighting aliens and Kang in order to get back to San Francisco and Earth. Quantumania - as I will be calling it for the remainder of this review - is a good movie - it's good but it is not great!! I like how the movie takes us from beautiful San Francisco all this way to this glowing dystopian Quantum Realm but once we are in the Quantum Realm there is not much imagination to the sets besides what we are given. The acting is good, Rudd combines comedy with action like nobodies business and is one of the few people that could play this role successfully!! The story is the same for Lilly, she does a terrific job as the Wasp, especially with the fight scenes!! Peyton Reed did a nice job directing this film and bringing all of the different talent together to tell a cohesive story. The team of Jeff Loveness, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, and Ernest Hart all did a nice job contributing to the story of Quantumania in some way or the other. Christophe Becke handled the music for Quantumania very well!! Sammy Sheldon did a nice job costuming all of the different characters - superhero or otherwise!! Quantumania received a PG-13 rating so it requires parental supervision for those under 13 otherwise it is the perfect movie for those seeking a fun escape for a couple hours!! 6 out of 10 stars!!","6/10"
"mkanatlar","3 June 2023","I rarely ever leave reviews on movies but I just had to say a couple of things about Across the Spider-Verse. The first movie was already so amazing that it inspired creativity in the animation industry but this installment just finessed its style. The different universes and styles, different animations; there were genuine moments where I felt chills just looking at the screen.I'm a story guy, I can appriciate good cinematography and visuals but the main thing that gets me going while watching movies is the story and let me tell you something: THIS IS SOME DAMN GOOD WRITING. The dialogue feels so alive and realistic, the small mimics and details make you feel like every scene was spent countless hours on to perfect. It all comes together beautifully. It works amazing as both a sequel and the set up of the third film, yet it is also a great standalone film as my friend who hasn't seen the first one also found it amazing.We can't forget the acting, as good as the animations and the hand drawings are amazing, the voice acting is as spectacular if not better than the first film. There has never been a moment which a character seemed dull or insensible. Props to all the voice actors, especially Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfield. I don't know the recording process of the voice lines but Miles and Gwen didn't have one moment where it didn't feel like I was watching a chemical reaction.The only thing that made me sad is that as the time frame got closer to the end, I expected the movie to end the way it did. I'm not mad because it ended the way it did but because I thought I'd have to wait 3 or 4 years for the sequel. Thank god it is announced to release next year so that's that.Whether you're an elder, adult, teen, or a child; this Spider-Verse story has something for you. Not only you'll enjoy the experience of watching a comic book; you'll also go through a fun, but heartfelt story. I think this is a movie everyone should see.","10/10"
"mkhulaify","1 February 2024","If you're expecting a masterpiece, an Oscar-worthy movie, the you gotta manage your expectations. This is a great movie that's loud, exciting, over-the-top, and fun! It delves deep into the action genre and delivers exactly what you'd hope for from a Jason Statham film. The fight choreography is top-notch, and the stunts are heart-stopping. However, while Statham shines, some of the supporting characters feel poorly written and their performances fall flat, which can be distracting. Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for adrenaline-pumping entertainment, this movie delivers in spades. Watch it for a quick brainless fun time with not much expectations, and you'll enjoy it.","6/10"
"mkivtt","3 July 2023","This movie was terrible. Is starts out well enough with maybe 15 minutes of action with a de-aged Indiana Jones fighting the nazis at the end of world war two.Then it all falls apart. Fast forward 25 years and Indy is a bitter old divorced loser who has nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to. But wait, here comes his goddaughter (from a supposed best friend we never knew about until now)! She's smart, much smarter than this pathetic old man. She's snotty. She's arrogant. She's beyond annoying. Kathleen Kennedy, is that you???So yeah, for the rest of the movie Indy serves as the pale reflection to make this annoying woman look good. He's stupid and slow, she's fast and smart and strong.To add insult to injury, they bring back Sallah from the previous movies (Gimli from Lord of the Rings) for a few minutes. He wants to adventure with Indy, and asks if he can join him. Wouldn't that be great? That's what fans want to see! But nope, the writers can't let that happen of course. It would take away from their annoying stupid new main character, the snotty girl! So Indy tells Sallah to get lost, and that's the last we see of him. Pathetic.If Disney thinks this kind of drivel is what fans want to see, they're mistaken. Nobody wants their childhood idols toppled and made into pathetic old fools, who were never even good to begin with apparently, says Disney. Nobody wants to see your annoying virtue-signaling messaging, your Mary Sue replacement characters, your bad CGI, and your obvious seething hatred at having to make a movie in a franchise that you either despise or don't understand, or both.May Disney lose hundreds of millions on this piece of fan disrespect.","7/10"
"mladen1987","27 April 2019","Let's face it, the movie is good and entertaining, well made with a few holes. Currently the score is that high ( more than 9) due to the hype, but the real score is around 7.I was expecting more dramatic ending and more deaths to be honest, but Marvel are too kind, so they would never do that.There were a few holes, like how the f did they discover the time travel within a few minutes? Something so complicated and impossible was discovered within a few minutes movie time. They should have spent more time on that.Thor was funny indeed but they really ruined the character, made him a monkey-like troll.A big ship was teleported and broke the entire building's ceiling , but nobody heard that? What?There are other details that were neglected, but I am not Rotten Tomatoe , I won't bash on the movie just because of a few things.As I said , the movie is well-made, good, entertaining, enjoy it.My score : 7/10","6/10"
"mluinstra","10 February 2024","Greetings from the other side. This is your typical Statham movie, but the black FBI chick, and the FBI itself dragged it down a lot.All of the scences with Statham were great, and Irons can read a dictionary and make it sound interesting. He was perfect for his role.Everything changes when they switch to the FBI chick and her partner. The action grinds to a halt, as does the entertainment. The movie would have been way better without them because so much time is wasted when they are on screen.They could have used the extra time to add a couple more Statham scenes, as they were excellent.Anyways, it's still a fun action movie that kills a bit of time.","1/10"
"mm-39","28 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was actually better than I thought it would be! I did come in with low expectations! Many fans of the Raiders series wondered will Woke Hollywood ruin another movie with forced awkward characters, and a disjoined preachy script which creates a collage of collective mush! Instead the last installment stayed true mostly to the 40's style action thriller. What worked: The start with a younger Jones with the action fight with the Nazi's over an artifact on a train is right out of the original Raiders movie. The middle works with an older Jones in the late 60's going threw the motions of acidemia only could be pulled off by a grouchy Harrison Ford. The bad guy who shares similarities to Wernher von Braun as a rocket scientist is a great bad guy. Smart as Jones, but has an evil similarity too Toht character of the original. Many little other formulated throw backs to the original is a nice with the film. The ending with the space time twist has a brilliant Quentin Tarantino style ending! What did not work: The Helena charter is the annoying person one asks is she going be at the party I hope not; But the Helena character helps push the story forward. The side kick kid is just as annoying like the screaming kid from temple of doom. The predictable chases, and the two weaker mentioned character mix into are story like cement causing story drag. Not perfect like the Original, but still hits the Raiders mark. 7 out of 10 stars.","6/10"

"moatandbailey","17 February 2023","... corner of the MCU. Scientific jargon tends to flow easily enough through a fair share of MCU films, particularly the better and best ones. The purpose seems to be to ground the story into something concrete, tangible and accessible, some relatable terra firma to allow us the audience even further immersion into the viewing experience. It's a neat story-telling device, which Ant Man has employed through all his movies so far- culminating in no less than the term quantum mechanics being integrated into the title of his third outing. And so ""Quantumania"" perseveres in the long MCU tradition of playing fast and loose with austere scientific concepts to engage the audience in a wild fantastic evidently neverending adventure. ""Quantumania"" isn't MCU's best, but it upholds the MCU's most tried and true science fiction fantasy tradition. And just as in science, once all the phases come into play, the sum should amount to greater than its parts. Ant Man has now cast his part in the lot, to be tallied later down the line, and it is a good part, if a bit part, from the character most likely to be overlooked- except for one thing: quantum mechanics, applied and theoretical, is a huge deal..! So here's to Ant Man- the hero no one cares about, but can't do without...!","6/10"

"mohnomachado","19 June 2023","The 3rd Ant-Man film has just about everything that is wrong with the current MCU films (besides outliers like Spiderman: No Way Home and Guardians Vol. 3). The humor is lacking, the story is bland, and the special effects just seemed rushed and incomplete. There is a specific character in this film that straight up looked like they took inspiration from George Lopez's character in Spy Kids. If that was the vision they were going for, great job Peyton Reed. Also was it really necessary to have a cameo from an older comedic actor (I won't spoil who) that has been reportedly abusive on set. I think whoever made that decision did not mind cuz as long as we get more eyes on the screen, it doesn't matter. This is a ridiculous film, with Paul Rudd trying his best to keep it together. Even his charm couldn't save this film. Pass on this for sure.","9/10"
"mohnomachado","2 July 2023","This was such a fun ride compared to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Despite this being one of the longer Indiana Jones films, I actually found the pacing quite smooth, especially during the action sequences. The de-aging looked great and it was wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in the saddle. He was probably the best part about the movie, which is saying a lot considering John Williams comes back again to deliver a memorable score. I think some side characters are throw away, the villain is cartoony (yet Mads Mikelsen always remains fascinating as a villain), and the slower scenes tend to run long, but if you are a fan of Ford and this franchise, this is a much watch. Also, Mangold is no Spielberg (and he shouldn't have to copy him to receive praise!), but I thought those action scenes were well choreographed. Good work.","6/10"
"MoistMovies","24 January 2019","For using a lot of CGI, they blended it better than any other anime ive seen using the medium. But still, many parts felt like they were cut scenes from a video game with more money put in, mainly the battle scenes. I couldnt escape that feeling unfortunately. It kept reminding me of how great they used to accomplish the fights in DBZ's later sagas, and how after all this time, they shoudlve been able to hand draw the fights and totally out do that earlier ones from the series/films.I get that its more expensive these days to do it all hand drawn, but considering the popularity of dragonball. They can afford to. 8 mil budget, and already they made 10x over that. Double the budget and keep most of it hand drawn and it'd have felt more like a animated film, rather than mash of film and video game cut scenes.And then theres the story, for the most part i enjoyed it. A different take on many familiar stories from the past when i grew up watching DBZ. But Frieza.. his motivations and story were silly and made no sense..
The height wish was very original dragon ball. But it felt out of place. And obviously a gag they intended to be in the same contrast to bullmas, it took me out of the film as being too far out of context with the rest of what was going on. Its been along time since original dragonball and frieza was never in it. The style of comedy didnt fit for me with him.
And i thought they'd have him grow as a character by now which i felt they were doing well in Super towards the end. One of my favorite parts of that series.
But in this film they regressed him back to a by the numbers villain type which i found unfortunate.
Goku is still less likable than he used to be, a change that happened early in Super, Im used to that now. So it didnt effect my enjoyment. He's growing as a character, just not the way i'd like. And vegeta becoming the responsible type more and more is what i prefer. But it creates a contrast that moves the stroy along for Super, so it's something i've grown to accommodate.Worth seeing in a theater if you're a dragonball/z/super fan. But if you're an older viewer like myself, you may not feel the same hype other younger viewers did especially if you are a critical person who loved the older sagas of DBZ and like hand drawn animation.","7/10"
"MoistMovies","29 April 2019","But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them","7/10"

"moneypennycharley","26 April 2019","Personally I found it mediocre at best. Too many contradictions to count. So thors hammer DOES grant him the power of lightning? I know Odin tells thor that it doesn't give him those powers but only helps him channel them, so what, cap has had that ability the whole time but saved it or never knew till now? And what's with the whole changing the past doesnt change the future? How does anything they do then accomplish anything. And why does nebulas eye thing just conveniently decide to play the most incriminating thing possible, when it could play anything in reality. I'm glad at least that the 1 dimensional captain marvel was not present most of the film, that at least was a plus. And further more, why was tony seemingly un injured from the stones, yet died? Is he a god and we never knew? Half god quil was nearly turned to ash from just one in seconds, tony used them all. I just dont how they ended up deciding to go down some of these paths. It's like they never saw any of the past movies. And hulk?bruce? Beta Hulk? What ever he is, he managed to find a way to be more useless than in the last film. Seriously what did he even do other than the first fix snap? Why not let thor do it, I think he could take the power of it if he can handle the full force of a stars radiation in the vaccum of space. And then cap just stays in the past like an a hole and watched all this horrible stuff unfold? How did any of the events that led up to it happen then with out him? They never needed him at all? And if you cant change the past, then how does he stay and literally change the past by being in it? Too many self creating paradoxes that they basically tell you to screw yourself if you start asking ""wait but why....?"" All in all, I think what we experienced here is they peaked with infinity war, and cant make something as good. I mean cmon, thanos had the personality of a lobster in this film. It felt like we were dealing with an unknown enemy, yet we do know him.... and Gamora died in infinity war yet never comes back? Why? Because it was the soul stone thst she died for? Then arent you changing the past by removing that Gamora from the time line? And why is Thor like a broken sexual assault victim, hes the GOD of thunder for crying out loud. and why does Thanos' most impractical weapon ever, his double sided sword thing, just absolutely demolish cap's shield? Did Tony give him a fake lol? And we get to see Loki grab the tesseract and vanish, and we never see the follow up to that? What a loss of a good plot line, follow lokito find it and enlist his help against thanos. HOW DOESNT IT CHANGE ANYTHING?!?!?! Seriously it just seems like lazy writing on their end more than anything else. Like someone got half this plot and someone pointed out, hey changing the past changes the future you know, so they were like ahh crap that's right, well, just have beta hulk give some science nonsense spiel about it and that should clear things up. And if taking past gemora to the future to replace the one they lost works fine..... why doesnt anyone go grab the Tony from before he left to get the stones? If changing the past doesnt change the future, how does it stop him from sacrificing himself? Same goes for black widow. The final battle seen wasnt that great either, I like my fair share of female super heroes but just the whole girl squad assemble thing was a little too much, like they all conveniently ended up in the same place at the same time, cmon we all know you just wanted you PC plug, you guys are more creative than that, that was just desperate and laughable. I'm a big fan of marvel movies, and to be fair this one had the most to live up to, but I still feel like they didnt do it justice. Perhaps they shouldve taken more time between films. Oh well. If the spider man movie is no good as well, I think I'll be parting ways with marvel films.","8/10"

"monuthube","1 July 2023","Yeah, watched it finally. I mean seriously, I'm following a lot of industry artists (intentionally) on Insta and LinkedIn. And I started getting the posts of artists who were involved in making this film, and the day it was officially released, all my Insta and LinkedIn feeds flooded with behind-the-scenes shots that artists worked on. My god, it freaking huge... Every morning I opened Insta or LinkedIn, there were artist posts everywhere and it happened for 3-4 days 😱. Then there I read the news that this movie had the highest number of production crews both 3D & 2D, working simultaneously 🤐.Looks like I need to update my favorite animated movie list, previously it was 'Into the Spider-verse', because of the story, animation, and music. Post Malone's Sunflower is still my phone ringtone for 5 years, which reminds me of the movie which is special to me and now definitely, it's 'Across the Spider-verse'. But, still, wait for it, this was just part 1 of a full sequel story... I'm super-damn-excited for 'Beyond the Spider-verse'.This time I watched the movie in the theatre, aka big screen. So, imagine how it was, the cityscape, duh and the conversion of Gwen and Miles, at the same time, this is what the best composition is! That whole scene was romantic and breathtaking. It's just too huge to save at once in my brain. And what the hell, the story, it's just so beautiful with the background music, it's still not high as the first movie (for me) but still it's best than any other which builds the moments you fall in love and become part of the story. Other than Miles and Gwen, Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 is a totally different highlight of the movie, his presence sets the tense and wild mood in every scene. I mean second half is where the movie gets high on adrenaline rush, the wildness of Miguel O'Hara and the background music, sets everything on fire. And wait, if you imagine this as a complete movie then let me tell you as per story structure it was just the middle part (2nd act of 3 Act story structure), the real climax is yet to be witnessed in 'Beyond the Spider-verse'. The end part of the movie... Ho-oh, that was damn-freaking tense and unexpected (I mean it was not that difficult to guess) but I figured out the problem, that everyone faces in the multiversal stories concepts, is just that min blowing. But the way it was built up to this was like, something unbelievable.Talking about animation, I don't need to tell you... you just need to watch this movie because this is the peak of animation (I think so), how can we measure the creativity? Every single world and character had a different art style, imagine it... How crazy can creativity can go. I loved Gwen's world which had an art style of watercolors, it changed with the mood of the story and that was just another level of beauty.I personally enjoyed this movie deep down to my heart, because it just so f*kn' from all sides, its story is amazing, the animation is at just a different level, and dialogues-drama is beautiful. The reference to pop-cultural and real-life references, I mean when did you laugh openly (deep from your heart) while watching the movie? I mean it was a total roller coaster ride, from happy-joyful moments to sad-tensed moments. And Gwen & Miles's romance is just so beautiful with that cityscape, you'll fall in love with the movie. And another thing that stands out is the scene composition, I mean really every scene is so f*kn' beautiful, I can't just process it (it happened to me while watching Avatar: Way of Water), I say this is as eyes getting orgasm.The thing is, Miles's character is so relatable to youngsters like us, that you understand his pov. I just wish not to cut the movie here, I mean it could have been more better if part two was added to this aka making it a 4-hour movie, and Gwen's taking the lead in the end was another best thing (from scene composition pov). There are so many things I want to talk about because I'm in love with this movie.I definitely-x-infinity will recommend this movie, to see what the best-est animated movie looks like, there are literally no flaws. It's all-round PERFECT in a big-bold, movie.If you hadn't watched the 'Into the Spider-verse' then start from there it's available on both Netflix and Amazon, then if possible enjoy 'Across the Spider-verse' on a big screen, just to feel the quality of the scenes.","10/10"
"morganyadron-36211","30 June 2023","I wanted this movie to be good so badly. The first 20 minutes are absolutely spectacular. The second act falls flat and loses the spark of the first. Also, it is very jarring to the viewer to see the first 20 minutes and go from that to Indiana Jones: depressed, gloomy alcoholic who lives in a small New York apartment. Completely disrespects the beloved character. Also, phoebe waller bridge is intolerable. Very poorly written character, condescending and patronizing to Indiana. It may as well be her movie because she does all of the work and thinking while Indiana does nothing.Final act and climax are good, a little far fetched but redeem the second act and it's boring-ness. Overall, depressing movie that doesn't have the speilberg/Lucas magic, ruined by ""Helena Shaw"" and her ""know it all/condescending"" attitude. Wait for this to come out on Disney plus! Save yourself money and don't give Disney more than they deserve. This movie was not and Indiana jones movie and any true Indy fan knows that.","10/10"
"morrison-dylan-fan","4 January 2013","Having been introduced to Ang Lee with his magical 2000 film Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,which was also my first ever none-English language movie,I was thrilled to hear that for his next movie,Lee was planning to do something pretty special in 3D.Taking a look for some basic details about the film online,I began to fear that Lee may have strayed into the plodding Castaway territory,due to a good amount of the movie taking place between two characters being stranded in the middle of an ocean.Doing my best to lower the sense of doubt I had as I entered the cinema,I began to set to witness Ang Lee cast the life of Pi Patel in shimmering 3D across the screen.View on the film:Introduceing a religious element very early on in his adaptation of Yann Martel's novel, (with Patel being a Hindu-Catholic,who also teaches Kabbalah at a university)screenwriter David Magee (whose last credit was for being a co-writer of 2008's Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day) handles the religious themes of the story with a real delicacy that never becomes overpowering or too preachy.Using Pi's multiple religious beliefs as a way to show a holding of faith and hope in a seemingly dyer situation,and also connecting Patel's experience's to mythological religious tales,with Magee superbly showing at the end,that the most outlandish of Pi's story,is actually the one which gets the points of his life across in the best way.Setting 90% of the film in the confined location of a life boat,and also having one of the two main characters be a tiger (!),Magee brilliantly avoids the easy trappings of the movie becoming a very dry affair,by using the changing conditions of the enviorment as a way to expertly show the rites of passage that Pi is going through.along with the conditions,Magee also gives the movie an unexpected,pleasing Comedy element which helps to show the bond which develops between Patel and Richard Parker.Keeping away from using 3D as a device to poke the audience in the eye with,director Ang Lee instead uses 3D as a way to draw the audience deep into Pi's world,with the scenes of Richard Parker possibly ""turning"" on Pi having a real dept of field,and Lee's use of elegant,long wide shots creating a strong,mystical atmosphere for the isolated world that Patel finds himself in.Taking a look online for info about the making of this stunning film,I was shocked to discover,that along with the film being lead by the debut actor Suraj Sharma as the 16 year old Patel (with Irrfan Khan giving a great performance as the adult Pi) Sharma co-star,the tiger Richard Parker,was almost completely CGI!Displaying no signs at all of tearing the movie at the seems,the CGI effects of Richard Parker blend seamlessly into the envioment,with the interaction,and developing relationship between Pi and Parker looking astonishingly life-like and completely photo realistic. Getting some pretty tough challenges put in front of him,which include being the lead star in his debut performance,and also having to act with a co-star who does not exist,Suraj Sharma gives a brilliant,eye-catching debut performance as the 16 year old PI .Showing the fear and hurt that Pi feels over seeing his parents die,Sharma expertly portrays in subtle gestures the changes that take place with Pi during his experience,that go from being closed in and fearing the unknown,to opening up,and allowing the viewer to be a part of the life of Pi Patel.","8/10"
"Movie_Beta","15 November 2023","The Dial of Destiny is the 5th film in the Indiana Jones franchise and a real throwback considering the gaps between sequels.I have to admit being sceptical about the much publicised de-aging of Harrison Ford for this role, but it was all done very well. Of course we get Nazi's and some must have ancient Macguffin to chase, and in this particular movie, some added 1960's setting nostalgia (The Beatles, Moon Landing etc). It is a bit overlong and too reliant on CGI effects which I feel is a missed opportunity given that real stunts and effects really made the original movie(s).The acting is good, especially Pheobe Waller-Bridge adding a quirky dynamic and Mads Mikkelsen as a convincing baddie. Adding a token kid sidekick plays a bit too much to the 'Short Round' character in the Temple of Doom, without pulling off the goofiness or fun of it. Harrison Ford looks his age and at times does not seem fully with it which is not great to see. Surely this has to be the last...Overall it is a good old fashioned nostalgia hit, though the epic length forces us to not forget this is a 2020's movie. Good intentions but more plot focus and less CGI would have done the job faster and better.7/10.","6/10"
"Movie_Reviews","2 February 2024","The worst thing about this flick is the acting. Sure, you have some seasoned talents but they mostly go through the moves. Even Jeremy Irons goes like ""hey, wait.. why am I here?"".And then I have not even mentioned the supporting actors. If the supreme ones seem like they are sleepwalking, then the supporting ones are just like horribly bad. Worst of all is Emmy Raver-Lampman who absolutely cannot have passed any acting class whatsoever.It is all so tragic. I have not seen anything as bad since ""The Meg"" and I am really trying my best to stay clear of the garbage put out these days, mainly watching old re-runs.","2/10"
"movie-reviews-uk","29 November 2022","On its own terms ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a good action movie but it's not a great film. The narrative is just too illogical and there are too many plot holes for that to be the case. What really saves it are the preceding two chapters in the story arc and the depth that they add to the characters.At the heart of the story sits Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his journey from newborn to weary warrior. There's a real sense that he never wanted to be the leader except that destiny spoke and he was the only one to answer. So he keeps up the struggle for his ape brothers while still wishing and hoping for a peaceful resolution.It's not to be though and this third installment draws heavily on other war movies (such as Apocalypse Now), concentration camp memes and even the Bible as sources. This makes it all rather bombastic but does provide for some genuinely exciting action sequences.Sadly the human characters in the film are as one-dimensional as ever so it's down to the apes to generate an emotional connection. Thanks to the wondrous CGI they still manage to do this although I think that the previous films had the edge on this front. Still I felt for Caesar and his friends as they struggled on against the malign influence of Man.Now if you're new to the franchise then it would be perverse to watch this film in isolation. It's just not that good in its own right. But as the finale to the rebooted trilogy it's fine and indispensable if you want to see how it connects to the later events seen in the pre-2001 films.","9/10"
"MovieCriticOnline","4 August 2018","The writing was so bad. Too many characters, horrible humor and one liners. It was cringeworthy. Just a bunch of mindless fights and battles we've seen a million times before and then the cringeworthy exposition and bad acting slowed down, low tone, over dramatic speeches.Evil man or group wants to destroy the world and just before they succeed they are stopped by the super hero(s). Seen one you've seen them all.
SKIP!!","5/10"
"MovieFan53424","17 November 2021","This film did nearly every Marvel/MCU fan justice. To see the epic conclusion of the Infinity Saga spanning for over 10 yearsThe film itself is great. The usual cast and crew teamed up to produce such an awesome film. The story could've maybe been more exciting during the middle. But that climax scene, wow! Definitely watch this film (but you need to watch every MCU film first)","9/10"
"MovieFanBenLinus8","27 February 2013","Life of Pi is an absolutely outstanding philosophical film, undoubtedly one of the best to come out last year. It recently won four Academy Awards, all of which were absolutely deserved; it is impeccably crafted and deeply moving. The first time I saw the film, the framing narrative structure disoriented me, due in large part to the deliberate pacing. After watching the movie again, however, everything clicked for me, and now I can say that there is hardly a false note among the storytelling. As an adult, the title character reflects back on his life, how it all changed him, and more importantly, how he still feels about it. We first meet the younger Pi in his school days, and we witness him acquire valuable skills from his family that will ultimately prove highly beneficial in his life, despite the fact that he takes much of it for granted. He also manages to create a new identity for himself, by taking the nickname of ""Pi"" and displaying his knowledge with the irrational number. This ties into much of Pi's overall philosophy; reality hardly matters. What's more exciting and engaging for him and his life is the overall better story. He is first and foremost a storyteller, and he is absolutely one who uses his power wisely. And so it is no wonder that he becomes so intrigued by three various, almost contradictory, religions. He deeply loves the sense of community he gains from them, and he deeply relishes in his faith. Starting with the stunning shipwreck sequence, however, he comes to realize that his faith must continuously be tested in order to be fully pure. And there is surely no stronger test of faith than being stuck in a lifeboat with nothing but an adult Bengal tiger. As time goes on, however, he manages to survive, all the while learning to appreciate the gift of life with what little time he has, and to realize that suffering is a necessity for true happiness. Much debate has been brought about by the film's ending; people wonder ""did it really even happen""? I personally find the ending extremely powerful, one that enforces the movie's thesis. It hardly matters what really happened at sea in the lifeboat; the only important thing is which story is better. And the jaw-dropping special effects only add to the excitement of the story; this is truly a larger than life experience. Even the use of 3-D is spectacular, as it fully immerses us in Pi's world. This is a technically flawless film, and it begs the question, ""was Avatar ever this visually stunning?"" I'd say no. Life of Pi is unquestionably one of the year's best films, and it is more than a film. It is an experience; both a visual one, a philosophical one, and a storytelling one. This film absolutely must be seen; it is an absolute stunner and a near-masterpiece. Overall Rating: 10/10- ""My Highest Recommendation.""","8/10"

"movieliker1","8 February 2022","All these Avenger movies are great fun. But they don't fit together well.The biggest question left by this quadrilogy is --- where was Captain Marvel in Infinity War? She is the most powerful and capable of all the Avengers. She says in Endgame the Universe is a big place. And everybody doesn't have The Avengers to take care of them. Well? How was she helping anybody in the Universe if she allows Thanos to wipe out half the Universe with the snap of his fingers? I wonder how the original comic books answered this question.Well, I guess we aren't supposed to take these stories too seriously. It's all make believe anyway.","3/10"

"movieman6-413-929510","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a new action thriller film from David Ayer, director of Fury and Suicide Squad.Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a retired special agent of the secret organization called The Beekeepers. During his retirement, he rents a place to keep bees from old Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad).When Eloise is scammed online, she loses all her money and discovers her life. As a result, Adam goes after the online organization in revenge to stop them before they manage to scam other elderly people. Because of this revenge, Adam himself becomes a target of the FBI and he gets Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman) Eloise, her daughter, after him.With this action film they seem to be playing on the lame, entertaining action films from the 80s and 90s. Action actors like Sylvester Stallone's Arnold Schwarzenegger have to do exaggerated things to make someone blush, while making a silly joke. Furthermore, the film also plays on concepts from more modern action films such as John Wick where there are hidden organizations with special rules for mutual special agents.Despite these familiar aspects for fans of previous action films, the story of this film remains a bit rushed and bundled. Apart from the exaggerated, lame action parts, the film itself is sometimes a bit difficult to keep up with. If the writer had focused a little more on the imaginary story and used a little less different characters in the film, it could have been a little easier to follow. The message about the bad sides of scamming people online or with fake calls is somewhat lost.The effects don't always come across either. Some flames and explosions are not always clear, because the CGI is so clearly visible. Sometimes you can also see where they use pupae after the beekeeper ends his strong with his opponents.Jason Statham once again delivers suitable acting in the leading role of this action film. This is already the fifth action film he has made in a row in recent times. The rest of the film cast also delivers suitable work, but due to the more selected sides, most of them get few opportunities to really do something with their characters in the film.","10/10"
"moviemanager","28 June 2023","This Indiana Jones movie was a tribute to the fans of the movie. I have always liked movies where imagination is used richly. Everything is possible in movies. Harrison Ford is naturally the biggest star of the film. Of course, there are important characters from other parts of the film series. I think the movie got off to a slow start. The opening is also not the best in the film series. The best starting part is still in the last crusade. In the film, we moved forward in time to the 60-70s, corresponding to the real passage of time. Indiana Jones still has enemies in this movies. Actually, the same manifestation of evil that he has often fought against. But then the best part. The end of the film was something really amazing and unprecedented in the film series. You have to see it for yourself. With a smile on my face, I can say that this was a good movie and a great ending to the series...","7/10"
"moviemanmo","17 January 2024","The title sequence was interesting with its bee and beekeeper related images.Phylicia Rashad playing the role of Eloise was believable as an elderly woman who is not privy to how online scams work. Unfortunately her screen time is very minimal as the filmmakers decided to kill their best actress.Jason Statham's motives for seeking revenge are very cliche. Although I didn't mind it, it could have been improved by further developing his relationship with Phylicia Rashad's character. Instead he literally just states that no one has ever taken care of him besides her.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays the role of Agent Verona Parker who happens to be the daughter of Eloise. She is so poorly written as a character and its immediately apparent the moment the audience is introduced to her. First she finds her mother dead and she didn't gasp or weep a single tear. Later on her family home that's supposed to have so many memories is burned to the ground and once again she is just stone cold like if it's nothing. Her dialogue is also weak and filled with lines that are laughable and poorly delivered.David Witts who plays the role of Mickey Garnett. He is the scammer that causes Eloise to commit suicide and while he was scamming her I enjoyed his character. He was playing the role well and felt like a true villain. However, once he is in contact with Jason Statham his character makes a switch and the performance is not good. Just like Agent Parker his dialogue and character are weak.Jeremy Irons who plays the character Wallace was okay. I did enjoy his explanation of what it meant to be a beekeeper and how Jason Statham's character played a role in the organization.Josh Hutcherson's character would have been better if he was more assertive and not babied. Lazarus was another character that would have been better if he had a serious tone. Instead he was used as a form of comedic relief but it was laughable in a bad cheesy way.As far as the action goes this film doesn't deliver anything new. The elevator scene is probably the only thing that stands out and the scene where Garnett is strapped to the pickup truck is a bit funny. The gas station scene is only memorable because of how it's horribly done. The special effects are not really good and could have been improved.The story was a bit intriguing which kept this from being boring. The pacing was rather quick and the film does fly straight to its conclusion. Not a great movie by any means but it can kill 2hrs if need be.","5/10"
"moviemanmo","18 February 2023","The introduction into the Quantum realm really gave me Star Wars vibes and I would say that's a good thing. The character designs were great. The plot and backstory for why things were happening was explained well and easy to follow. All the characters from the previous films played their roles well.As far as new characters, Kang was excellent. Though he didn't show off too much of his powers. I wasn't expecting him to so I wasn't disappointed. I would say towards the end, the film did make him seem a bit weak. Great character played by a great actor nonetheless.Modok could have been better. His initial look was fine but once his true identity was revealed that's when he looked weird. They could have done with working on that CGI or not show that version of him that many times once they showed who he truly was. He was used too much for comedic relief and towards the end it was a bit much.The action in the film was entertaining but nothing over the top.The dialogue and forced comedy towards the end is what brings this movie down a bit. There were bits of dialogue/scenes that could have been taken out and the film would have been much stronger. Specifically from Modok and Ant-man's daughter and like one line from Kang.Overall it was another entertaining Ant-man movie that didn't disappoint. Don't believe the Critics, enjoy the film.","6/10"
"moviemanmo","2 June 2023","The movie does a great job catching the audience up with Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. While we catch up to what's going on in their lives presently, we are also reminded of the events that took place in the previous film thus connecting both stories into one.Miles is the only Spider-man in his world and is dealing with that inner conflict. At the same time the film shows that Gwen Stacy is dealing with similar feelings. The characters are parallel to one another and even their family dynamics are similar as they deal with the issue of revealing to their families their true identity. This further adds to the idea of the spider-verse and how similar characters are dealing with similar issues although they are still unique.Gwen Stacy's backstory is explained in detail setting up some emotional moments between her and her father making this film feel grounded and relatable. Not only is it emotional but it also sets up perfectly her reason for joining the other Spider-men.Meanwhile Miles's story is used to introduce the new villain ""Spot"". The buildup to this character was very cool because it made the audience view him exactly how Miles Morales did while the movie was taking place. Spot initially felt like a dumb villain but then he turned into a serious threat and the build up to it was perfect.Miguel O'Hara was another cool character introduced in this film and I liked how his story and intentions were used to further explain how the Spider-verse works. He also added to the drama of the story and provided some intense moments throughout the film.There were so many cool cameos but it was done in a unique way that flowed with the story and not for the sake of including it. There are too many variations of Spider-man to mention but they were all very cool, it was a treat every time a different one was on screen. Also, all of the parents in this film felt organic and true to how parents would deal with the situations that were taking place.This film brought back the comic book style from the last film but it added upon it. When the story was taking place in Gwen Stacy's world the animation style was different than in Miles Morales' world and that attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed. This film gushes with style and blossoms with colors. It's just visually stunning all around. The character designs were just pure art especially with characters like Spider-punk and Spider-man India. The voice acting was amazing. All of the voices suited the characters and never felt out of place.This movie had a lot more heart and drama than the first film with an even better story. The conflict in this story is truly gripping and is intensified with each scene. It is all explained in great detail without being complex or convoluted. This movie was also funnier than the last one but it was never forced or took away from what was going on.This movie is entertaining from beginning to end. It will leave you wanting more by the time it ends. This is easily the best film of the year thus far without comparison. It did everything the first film did but better. This was truly a perfect movie.","10/10"
"MovieNewsAndUpdates","25 November 2012","Before giving any review about the movie i must request everyone to watch this movie only in a 3D format because i feel it is one of the very few of the 3d movies which retains its soul despite being in 3d format and not being a mere sales technique. Life of Pi is not a story about survival as many of viewers who have and have not read the book mentioned it already. It is not a story about a cast away. It is much more than that. It is about faith, religion, endurance and most important of all relationships. I have not read the novel on which the movie is based but yet i can be pretty sure that the movie has done almost or complete justice to it. With no intentions of watching this movie i went in expecting nothing but came out thanking the ones who took me for this movie. Ang Lee has always had an incredible ability to depict human emotions in various ways and various characters which we have seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. But in this one he goes a step beyond and creates an emotion between a human and an animal. But it just doesn't end there, he adds the flavor of perfection to the movie by giving incredible visuals. Now being stranded on a sea can be a boring script especially when you have a run time of 145 minutes but Ang Lee shows us so much in that time that you end up craving for more. With exceptional visuals and incredible performance by the lead, Life of Pi is an unforgettable movie for me and it does make me believe in God. I am sure it will succeed in making a lot of other people believe. There are unforgettable moments in the movie and it is going to be extremely difficult for anyone to pick just one. But i am sure everyone will like the last ten minute of the movie which make you think and go through the movie again. I salute Ang Lee for such a beautiful depiction of the book and portraying so many beautiful things and putting the CGI and Animation to the right use. The movie is a pure piece of Art and must not be missed under any circumstances. I would really wish to see this movie in the IMDb top 250 list","9/10"
"MovieRiffing","15 July 2019","One would hope that on the second attempt of telling Broly's origin story all of the kinks would be ironed out. Unfortunately, this new entry brings issues of its own. Instead of silly (but somewhat charming) narrative devices bogging down the story, this time truly dreadful CGI ruins the final showdown. Interrupting beautiful 2D animation with underfunded 3D efforts has become commonplace in modern anime, and Dragon Ball Super: Broly got hit square in the face.","8/10"
"moviesmoviesmovies","6 September 2023","I went into seeing Indiana Jones with the lowest expectations and darkest perception of what's to come (based on many reviews), but I had a great time and was entertained, thoroughly, for over 2 hours.There are some issues with the film, but if you like Indy, time travel, killing Nazis, and want some closure to this saga, this film is it. There's even redemption for the main characters who learn a thing or two about life.What I did not like is the poor quality CGI of NYC, particularly the parade sequence. Broadway, where the parade actually took place, is quite large. This film's version looks like a small Brooklyn street.There are a couple of other issues - if Indy is being sought after by the police and all the law enforcement people of NYC, why is his name screamed out at the airport for all to hear? And how does he even get near a plane, let alone get on one?All that aside, I enjoyed this film. I found the ending fitting and satisfying.","9/10"
"MoviesorSleep","29 July 2017","The great question sci-fi films pose (and I do believe these movies can be categorized as sci-fi) is: ""What does it mean to be human""? ""What separates us from other creatures?"" Woody Harrelson's character put it best in repeatedly saying, ""So emotional!"" to a chained Caesar for it is precisely that -- our capacity for emotion: compassion, empathy, and mutual understanding for the other is what is said to make us human. Colonel: ""There are times when it is necessary to abandon our humanity to save humanity"" Think of the other two films, it spends the majority of the time convincing the audience that apes are not savages and instead quite rational due to their increased intelligence, and therefore, emotional intelligence. They are able to form communities with families and friends developing trust, love, and the such. But it doesn't stop there, Caesar proves himself, repeatedly, to apes and humans that ""ape"" does not automatically equal savage. (Insert obvious Koba internal struggle here). This is proved in the first couple minutes of the film, where he spares the lives of soldiers, and later on where Caesar is suffering from a sort of PTSD from Koba's death. The film spends quite a bit of time on reactions mixed in with moments of silence. It is contrasted quite well with the dramatic music and epic battle scenes. The title may have mislead people since many assume with the word ""war"" in the title, the movie would have tons of ape vs. human fighting, but it cannot be reduced to that. Dialogue, mostly through (hand)signing amplified the serious and silent nature of suffering and uncertainty in war. It is powerful. Silence makes the audience pay closer attention to the precise facial expressions of the apes. Expressions of uncertainty in planning the next move, suffering in the cages many once lived in, and despair in light of losing a loved one. The moments of silence, the quiet, heart-wrenching moments as the camera zooms closer and closer to the individual's face, further humanizes the subject. Think of the moment when Caesar realizes the Colonel murdered his wife and eldest son, the score slows, the camera shows Caesar's tears and clenched jaw with exposed teeth. It cuts to Colonel's face in a rough, make-up camouflage. The Colonel thought he was killing Caesar. Who is shown as the savage here? I do not think the film can be reduced to humans = bad and now apes = good. Times of war operate in gray zones, and in film, it is the audience's ultimate decision in what is deemed as a moral act. Because we can't blame the Colonel for trying to save his people. We also can't blame Caesar for trying to save his community. But at what cost? If we abandon our morality, what are we but a creature? So the question is ultimately: What is Ape/What is Human Needless to say, it is a film worth thinking of a bit deeper, regardless of your perception of its political motive and religious and historical commentary, albeit, it does exist. It is beautifully shot, well acted (go Andy Serkis!), and a terrific conclusion to the Planet of the Apes reboot, prequel, and trilogy.","1/10"
"movieswithgreg","25 June 2018","Good lord this was slow. I do appreciate ""slow"" films, foreign stuff, art stuff, character stuff, etc, but this, at its best, is trying to be some inaccessible allegory that I had to struggle to comprehend, or -- it's what it appears to be -- a movie that lost its message through muddled writing and misguided re-writes or heavy handed script doctoring and myopic producing. It just CRAWLS. Aimlessly. This is the third of an ever-worsening series of reboots. The first one was worthy. The second was fun but empty. This third? I'm so glad I followed my instincts and refused to pay a theater ticket to see it. The message or theme is simple, and repeated -- humans are mean spirited savages, apes are noble savages. Yeah, we got it the first time. It's also trying to be a poorly executed morality play on ""us vs them,"" on ""natives vs immigrants,"" and tribalism based on race. There's even a ""Wall"" featured. In ten years, will any viewer remember what ""the wall"" was about?  Yeah yeah, it's an ever-important message, but it requires better execution and exposition in this day and age. What's next -- GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, with the groom-to-be the human, and his fiance and parents apes?","3/10"
"movietalkwithmuhammed","17 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was overly advertised as the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Phase Five. It also set to have Kang the Conqueror who was depicted to make Thanos look like a walk in the park. Marvel really puffed up what this movie was going to be, and it did not deliver.Before reading any further, if you are a die hard MCU fan, then you will most likely disagree with my rating and review of this movie. That is okay.About 90% of the movie takes place in the Quantum Realm, but it did not introduce anything new about it. It lacked any depth into strengthening its value and place in the MCU. It just seemed like if Ant Man and the rest of the main cast were fighting on one of the distant planets in Star Wars; it was just there with no build to the greater hierarchy.The dynamic between Cassie Lang and her father, Scott Lang/Ant Man, was absolute garbage. If you rewind the clock, Ant Man was stuck in the Quantum Realm back when Thanos snapped his finger. He was gone for five years before luckily escaping, and that was lost time he could have had with his daughter. When they reunited, it was heart felt and full of emotion. That was the last of seeing their relationship. Then now Cassie had so much resentment towards her father, and it went unexplained. What happened from then to now?Kang's character was a joke. He was not the threat marketing/advertising made him to be. He lacked conviction, and he lacked that villain presence that fuels fear. Even at the end of the movie, Ant Man himself was reflecting on their battle, and he literally brushed it off his shoulder like one would after tripping and falling then just simply picking yourself back up.If anything, the end credit scene is what really setup for the future of the MCU. Honestly, it felt like what Dwayne Johnson did with Black Adam's end credit scene where he had Henry Cavill return for a Superman cameo. What is the point of that? Overall, save your money and wait for this to stream on Disney.","6/10"
"MovieWarfare","11 February 2024","I came for a fun action movie starring Jason Statham and got exactly that. It is an inferior John Wick movie with an elderly dying of a scam instead of a dog.The big problem this movie has is its terrible writing and dialogue. It is filled with countless Bee puns and one-liners that don't land. The characters are forgettable and one-dimensional. The villain is very cartoony compared to every other character. There is a person sent to kill our main character halfway through the film that feels like they are from a completely different movie.However, you are here for the action scenes and they are very fun to watch with their great choreography. In the end, that is what most people are watching this for and it delivers.","8/10"
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","19 February 2023","I definitely dont think its as bad as the critics are making it out to be. I wouldnt say its rotten. But its definitely not a top favourite of mine either. Im not sure where I would rank it out of the whole MCU, but in terms of the other Ant-Man films, I still like the first one the best, and Id probably put this above the second one. My biggest gripe with this movie is the ending. Without giving too much away, I wish it had mirrored what Janet had done earlier during a flashback. And I didnt feel it was a satisfying end for Kang. I felt like it took him a peg down on being a badass villain. Which is a shame because I think Jonathan Majors was great in the role. Also, I wouldnt say the CGI is bad but there were a number of moments where it really looked like a bunch of actors standing in front of a green screen. Which I guess is a problem when 95% of your movie takes place in an entirely CGI world. So it kind of took me out a bit as I wasnt fully immersed as I should be. Although CGI wise I think M. O. D. O. K could have looked better. I know hes a weird looking guy to begin with. But it was definitely very uncanny valley in a bad way. Now I dont care that the last Cassie actor got replaced....but I dont think Kathryn Newton was a good replacement. I just didnt feel like she matched the previous Cassie's and I didnt feel like she had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast. And my other gripe, for a movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp you'd think they would both be the main characters but Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) didnt have a lot to do in this movie. I mean she also spends a good chunk of the movie separated from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Unless the title refers to Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) because she definitely plays a more important role in the film.All that being said though, I had fun with the film. It still has some of that silly Ant-Man humour. I loved the beginning and ending framing device with the voice-over. But the film also has plenty of serious moments that work too. Even though I griped about the ending, I liked where it was heading. Kang just absolutely brutalizing Ant-Man was great. I think the Quantum Realm and getting to explore a different realm was fun and interesting (although a lot of -production and costume wise) did remind me of Star Wars. And I loved the family dynamics in the movie.I rated the film a 7, but I would say its probably more of a 7.5 for me.","7/10"

"Mr-Fusion","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10","3/10"
"Mr-Fusion","4 June 2023","God, what a rush this movie is!I said it back in 2018, Sony really has something special here, and ""Across the Spiderverse"" is an enhancement in nearly every way. And it's a rush, an absolute blast for anyone looking for a summer escape.I love that the writers spend so much time on Miles and Gwen, their relationship, their struggles with expectation, and to see them go for a swing through NYC is just ... I love that vibe, man. In such a headlong flight of a story, it's refreshing to see Miles' social and family lives fleshed out.But it is a full-tilt movie, and once it starts dealing with the actual Spiderverse, it's chaotic, breathless and a welcome sensory barrage of color and eye-popping animation. It is a theme park ride, and one I'd absolutely do again.This continues to be the most unique, character-authentic series of Spider-Man movies and I am unquestionably a fan.","10/10"
"Mr-Fusion","6 July 2023","It's fine. I guess.All throughout ""Dial of Destiny"", there were two biases I couldn't shake. One was the age factor that was so stressed back in ""Crystal Skull"", (the passage of time, dearly departed friends and overall aging). That was fifteen years ago(!), and here we are again because Iger wants to cash in on another IP. That's the other problem I had: why are we here? That's really the movie's overall burden.It's not a bad film, it's just *there*; it ticks off boxes with a very long running time and an insufferable Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Dial"" occupies that middle ground between ""Raiders"" and ""Crystal Skull"": safe and boring.Kudos to Ford for proving himself yet again and I appreciate the desire to give his favorite character a proper send-off. But this is a clear-cut example of a studio refusing to leave well enough alone.The perfect ride into the sunset happened two movies ago.","2/10"
"mrashtastic89","11 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a marvel masterpiece, and a top 5 comic book movie of all time, the first one is one of my favorite movies ever, and that goes for this entry too. What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? It is a striking masterpiece, both visually and ethereally, it is absolutely phenomenal in every single way.I have no words for how exquisite this animation is, it improves on the original in so many vastly various ways, the colors pop off of the screen and these workers put their all into it, there are very few movies I've seen that look this good, actually, there's only one.Shameik Moore is absolutely incredible in this movie, Miles's character arc is done to perfection and Miguel O'Hara's backstory was absolutely masterful, this film managed to fit in almost every single piece of Spider-Man media in just 2 hours and 16 minutes, including frickin Spectacular Spider-Man and an insane amount of other things.And the ending cliffhanger was absolutely jaw-dropping, I wish I could build a time machine to take me to the release date of Beyond the Spider-Verse.Across the Spider-Verse is one of the best comic book and marvel movies of all time, and one of my favorite movies that's ever been made, this gets an A double plus.","10/10"

"Mrbigham13","20 January 2024","I decided to see what all the Buzz was about tonight and take a look at this recent flick. This is just another run of the mill Statham action flick, but this time with a real sting in the end. Jason Statham the man I grew up with as ""The Transporter"" kicks ass per usual. The set pieces suffice with some obvious CGI explosions here and there. The supporting actors are good enough and of course all the villains are white with the ""United Nations"" of heroes serving as the FBI.This story really goes out on a limb, as do most action flicks these days. The political satire was just about as dumb as the real thing. I enjoyed the pot shots towards the Biden and Clinton crime families. Overall it's not a bad movie if you turn off your mind which seems to be all we do these days considering the low quality ""woke"" entertainment we're fed. What we have here is a real honeypot of cliche action mixed with standard modern day ideology. Nothing groundbreaking but pretty much expected, check it out.","6/10"
"mrbledsoe53","3 June 2023","As visually stunning and groundbreaking of the animation, unfortunately, it was too much to take. I'm in my early 40s so younger viewers probably won't be affected as much. Didn't have an issue with Into the Spider-verse, but apparently, they increased the intensity to the point that I left with a headache. The different frame rates of characters in the same scene, the visual distortion in the background at times, made it difficult to focus and was basically visual overstimulation. I enjoyed the story and would like to see Beyond the Spider-verse but may have to just read about it if the animation is as intense as this film.","10/10"

"MrDHWong","16 February 2023","""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10.","1/10"
"MrDHWong","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10","2/10"
"MrDHWong","27 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot film series. Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield and ""Dawn""), this third and final chapter in the continuing saga of Caesar the ape is easily one of the best conclusions to a film series ever made.Five years after the events of ""Dawn"", Caesar's (Andy Serkis) ape clan are now fighting off the members of a human resistance group known as Alpha-Omega. The leader of the Alpha-Omega is the mysterious Colonel (Woody Harrelson), a cold and bitter man bent on wiping out apes and re-establishing humanity as the dominate species on Earth. After the apes suffer major losses from constant battles against Alpha-Omega, Caesar decides to move them out across the border to a nearby desert, where he and the apes can live peacefully without any danger posed by humans. Along the way, Caesar, who is still haunted by what the rogue ape Koba told him years ago, starts questioning his own sense of morality and tries to come to terms with his inner animal instincts.With eye-popping visuals, great action, and touching moments of drama, War for the Planet of the Apes effectively concludes the ""Apes"" reboot trilogy on a powerful, yet appropriate note. Topping ""Dawn"" was a tall order, but ""War"" definitely succeeds in just about every way. The CG effects were all highly convincing and seem to have improved drastically after each film. As was seen in the previous two films. Andy Serkis is outstanding as Caesar the ape. Forget Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, this is the role Serkis should be remembered for. Woody Harrelson also gives a convincing performance as the Colonel, almost as though he is channelling Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Long time fans of the franchise should keep an eye out for some clever inside references to the other Planet of the Apes films, some so subtle they're hard to pick right away.I rate it a solid 9/10","8/10"
"MrDHWong","29 June 2023","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is the fifth entry in the ""Indiana Jones"" film series. Directed and co-written by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"", ""Logan"", ""Ford v Ferrari"") and starring Harrison Ford in the lead role, it proves that the quality of a belated sequel can only be as good as the age of its protagonist and the strength of its characterisation.In 1969, Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford) retires from his job as an archaeology teacher at his local university in New York. As he drowns his sorrows away in a bar, Jones encounters Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), his estranged goddaughter and the daughter of one of his late archaeologist friends. Picking up where her father left off, Shaw has been hunting for the ""Dial of Destiny"", a powerful ancient artefact capable of causing rifts in time, and asks for Jones's help in tracking down its three missing pieces. After the pair discover the location of one of the parts, they are attacked by former Nazi agent Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who has his own plans for the Dial of Destiny and its world-changing abilities. Voller and his henchmen quickly pursue the pair across various countries, stopping at nothing until he has all three pieces in his possession.Ever since the release of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" over 40 years ago, the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise has remained one of the most beloved adventure series in the history of pop culture. The titular hero, recognisable by his trademark fedora, leather jacket, whip, dry sense of humour, and extensive knowledge of archaeology, is one of two signature roles played by Harrison Ford (the other being Han Solo in the ""Star Wars"" films). Over these past four decades, there have been four films made featuring the character, with the general consensus being that the first three are the best and the fourth, 2008's ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", still evoking sharply divided opinions among fans and critics even to this day. Fifteen years and a Disney buyout later, we now have a fifth entry in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", a supposedly final addition to the film series that capitalises on as much nostalgia as possible while unfortunately losing sight of what made all these films so special in the first place.The character of Indiana Jones (Indy) has always been intended to embody the archetype of the masculine, strong-willed heroes you would read about in the pulp adventure novels of several decades past. Jones is not only proficient in physical combat and weaponry, but he is also quick-witted and highly intelligent, though he is certainly not immune to human error. To that effect, he is the type of hero that many men strive to be like and many women desire to be with. Like ""Crystal Skull"" before it, ""Dial of Destiny"" has made the mistake of assuming the audience wishes to see Indiana Jones as an old man incapable of performing some of his best feats without any kind of assistance.When we are first introduced to Indy in this film, it is through a flashback scene showcasing what he is most well known for - fighting off bad guys who are after a priceless artefact. Shortly thereafter, the film flashes forward to the late 1960s where we see an elderly Indy complaining to his young neighbours about their loud music. Though this scene is meant to be played for laughs, I just couldn't help but feel sad instead at seeing this once legendary action hero reduced to a cranky ""get off my lawn"" old man who isn't taken seriously by the youth of that era. This is a far cry from the Indy we once knew and loved, who used to revel in the playful nature of an adventure and would always find a way to cleverly correct a situation rather than simply whine about it. If this were the only instance where Indy's age was called into question, I could maybe let it slide but to my annoyance it becomes practically the entire backbone of his character from start to finish.Another thing that the ""Indiana Jones"" films are known for are their exciting action scenes, usually involving a vehicle with the backdrop of an exotic location. This tradition continues here as we are treated to some fast-paced car chases, fist fights, and the odd shootout in places such as Morocco and Greece. Taking over directorial duties from Steven Spielberg, James Mangold proves he was the right choice as he manages to hold the audience's attention during these scenes with his clever editing techniques, which adds some important tension whenever necessary. My favourite action sequence was probably the one at the beginning, which takes place on a train as previously mentioned. There are a few fun call-backs to the previous films sprinkled in which I won't spoil, but the reason I liked it the most was because it featured a younger Indy as opposed to a decrepit old man. Every other moment of action looked awkward in comparison, as we are forced to watch an old Indy constantly try to keep up with enemies bombarding him with a barrage of bullets and punches.Taking into account his advanced age, I have to give credit to Harrison Ford for trying his best to hold up alongside his considerably younger cast members. Based on nostalgia alone, his final reprisal of one of his most iconic characters is enough to stir up feelings of sadness in longtime Indiana Jones fans such as myself. This is a character Ford clearly has a personal attachment to, which makes sense when you remember his enduring popularity after all these years. Yet despite all that, the octogenarian actor just doesn't seem like he is a natural fit for this type of action any more. There are parts where Indy looks exhausted from just throwing a single punch and one scene in particular required him to ask his partner Helena to help him move a relatively small stone into place. The younger Indy would have had no trouble with any of this in the past so seeing the geriatric version struggle to pull off even the most basic of tasks comes across as rather disheartening, though perhaps not in the way the filmmakers intended.I also didn't particularly care for the way Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character Helena was handled in the film. What I assume was supposed to be a younger, more energetic partner for Indy to play off is instead a condescending and smug accomplice who insists on being right all the time. The whole way through it just felt like Helena is only helping Indy solely out of obligation rather than because she truly cares about him, like the way one would assist a random old person crossing the street simply as a sense of public duty. Often whenever Indy is unable to maintain the pace of what is happening around him, Helena will make a point of berating him for his age and that he is ""stuck in another era"". I can't tell if these parts are meant to be funny or if we're supposed to assume she is only teasing but it makes her character seem rude and unlikeable. Normally I'm all for sassy female companions to male heroes, but if her only gimmick is to insult him and always rub his flaws in his face then I quickly start to lose interest in these types of characters.It seems like a natural fit for Mads Mikkelsen to play an ""Indiana Jones"" villain, but for the most part his character doesn't work as well as he should. Voller is somewhat similar to Colonel Dietrich from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", in that he is a high ranking Nazi officer hunting down an artefact that can change the world. Of course, Mikkelsen excels at playing sinister European-accented villains, yet this film doesn't really give him enough memorable material to work with. The problem here is that we don't properly learn the reason why he actually wants the artefact so badly until far too late into the story. By the time we are told what he intends to do with it, the film is almost over. This is the type of villain who needs to make his end goal clear earlier in the film rather than later, because most of the time I just didn't feel any tension when he was pursuing Indy and co. You could argue that Voller being a Nazi is good enough reason to want to stop him, and while that is true, I still think the film could have done a better job fleshing out his character and motivations beyond that.As a purported conclusion to the series, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" ends things not with a bang but with a quiet fizzle. While it doesn't reach the levels of ridiculousness as nuking a fridge or shoehorning in aliens where they don't belong, the film nonetheless fails to reach the heights of its first three classic entries, which to be fair, is a very tall order. Regardless, there are still some fleeting moments of entertainment that should keep most audiences satisfied. As for me, I'm one of those people who thinks the series should have ended at ""Last Crusade"", with everything else following being nothing more than an unnecessary epilogue. However, given Disney's tendency to milk franchises for all they're worth, it is inevitable that there will probably be more ""Indiana Jones"" content coming whether we want it or not.I rate it 6/10.","6/10"

"msbreviews","15 March 2019","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you stopped following Dragon Ball after Z or you don't even know what DB is, you'll basically be lost. You won't recognize certain characters, you won't understand how and why some guys are still alive, and you'll have no clue about how strong our warriors became. This is for the fans. I've seen critics bashing this film to shreds, and they start their reviews stating ""I've never seen the anime."" Then why would you watch a movie that clearly follows the anime's story and review it? Just leave it alone!This is the best Dragon Ball film ever, by a long shot. Yes, the track record wasn't that good to begin with, and most of the movies released aren't even canon. Still, Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F' were pretty great, especially the former. Broly easily surpasses these two, in almost every aspect. Of course, I need to be fair to those first films. Dragon Ball Super elevated the anime once again and brought it back to the mainstream, so obviously, Broly had a lot of advantages since the studios offered everything they could so that the movie would be a major success. When the first two films were released, Super didn't exist yet. Basically, these first movies were trying to bring back Dragon Ball to life while Broly is all about keeping it alive and showing it still has tremendous potential.Thankfully, it all worked out perfect. The box office results are mind-blowing which will surely guarantee the continuation of Super (I'm waiting every single day for the news of the series renewal), and the film is, in fact, astonishing. The animation quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. You know when you go with friends to watch a movie and something so awesome occurs that you just look at each other in awe of what just happened? That's Broly every single minute from the moment the fight begins. Super gave the fans a glimpse of what the animation level could be if time was not an issue for the animators. The Tournament of Power arc is undeniable proof that when the production leaves the animators work with no pressure, the end result is outstanding.It's just so freaking awesome. This is the only word in the dictionary that can reflect how crazily good the animation is. Awesome. There are so many long sequences of choreographed fights, with the animation always on-point, and with exceptional editing. The aspect I love the most is probably how fast it all is. Finally, I can understand Krillin when he says ""how are you following that?!"" Everything flows in such a flawless style: the characters, the blasts, the environment, everything. The sound design is incredibly powerful, as well. From the get-go, you know you'll feel every punch, kick, ""Kamehameha"" and ""Galick Gun."" Goku, Vegeta, and Broly provide so many amazing action scenes, and I know I'll constantly rewatch them once they become available. God, Super ended a year ago, and I still find myself watching the final fight with Jiren every week or so.However, Dragon Ball isn't about the fights. Yes, everyone loves them, and there are a lot of fans who only care about the actual moment when our heroes fight their enemies. As a hardcore fan of the saga, it's so much more than that. If characters like Goku and Vegeta, but also Piccolo, Gohan or even Frieza didn't exist, their battles wouldn't have the same impact. They mean something because these characters are important to me. I care so much about them because they were beautifully-developed throughout hundreds of episodes. I know that fillers can be a bit boring, but for me, they were just another way of getting to know these characters. Give me twenty minutes of banter between Goku and Vegeta, and I'll be the happiest man on Earth, right now.I'll put it this way: if you enjoyed Battle of Gods more than Resurrection 'F', you will love DBS: Broly as much or more than I do. If it's the other way around, the first half of this film might leave you a bit disappointed. If you're one of those fans who only care about the fights, you can leave the first 45 minutes with barely any Goku or Vegeta to me and the other fans who care about the story. I heavily praise Akira Toriyama's screenplay. This is the big difference to the other non-canon movies: they weren't written by someone who really understands the characters at their disposal. Toriyama knows exactly who Broly is, where he comes from, and how he lived through his young years.He wonderfully flushes out Broly by giving him an emotionally captivating backstory, filled with parent abuse, violence, and isolation from the rest of the universe. The history of Saiyans and Planet Vegeta is (finally) told entirely, by showing us characters that we all know and love, but that we were never able to see for more than a few minutes. Nevertheless, the standout character of the film is Broly. He has more screentime than any of the other warriors, precisely due to the reason I mentioned above: for us to care about him. Truth is, when they start fighting, I don't want anyone to win or lose, because I genuinely care about all of them. Toriyama wasted half of the movie to develop this ""new"" character, and I 100% support his decision. Not only it generates more build-up to the inevitable climax, but it offers more layers to it. It stopped being ""just a fight.""Obviously, there were going to be nods to the past adventures. I almost dropped a tear when Goku and Vegeta show up for the first time due to the soundtrack alone. You'll love every single ""flash"" regarding previous moments of Dragon Ball history, including the latest series and arc. Toriyama also does a remarkable job in helping fans that never watched Super trying to understand what happened after Z, even if he didn't need to. The comedy bits are hilarious, as they have been with the latest series. From Vegeta yelling at Goku for doing or saying something dumb, to Bulma's interactions with Beerus and Whis, every joke lands in one way or another.As much as I love this film, it does have some issues regarding its mixing of CGI with animation. One of the things I didn't like at all in Resurrection 'F' was how some sequences felt like a video game. Unfortunately, there are a couple of moments like that in Broly. In order to keep the scenes flow without any cuts, CGI is necessary so the camera can change to another angle, and sometimes there's this feeling that you seem to be playing one of Dragon Ball games. However, my biggest gripe has to be with the overuse of visual effects. Using VFX to build rich environment and help the battles have more impact, not only doesn't work well but it's just not Dragon Ball.As we reach the climax, the VFX overpower the animation, and that is never a good thing. The fight loses its animated essence, and it becomes something that I don't even know how to describe, except that it isn't what it was supposed to be. In addition to this, even though I stated that this movie is about Broly and Broly alone, I would have loved to see more from Frieza. He acts purely as a plot device, and there's barely anything for him to actively do, but he's still important to make the plot move forward. Finally, the pacing could have been more balanced. Since the ending is predictable from even before the fight begins, it feels that the film was a bit stretched to try to reach the two-hour runtime.Also, if you've seen all the trailers, you basically know the entire movie. That's why I keep advising my followers to stop watching trailers or at least all of them. If you really need visual confirmation that the film deserves your time and money, watch the first trailer and decide from there. Dragon Ball Super always gave spoiler-heavy previews of the next episode, and the movie literally shows everything. Even without watching a single clip from it, I couldn't escape the spoilers regarding the appearance of specific characters, which pretty much ruined any surprise the film could have offered me. Even with that in mind, I still think the ending felt a bit rushed, contradicting the somewhat slow pace during the first two acts.In the end, there's no doubt about it. Dragon Ball Super: Broly is, by far, the best Dragon Ball movie to date, and it's really freaking awesome! It beats any other installment of the franchise, including the latest films. Akira Toriyama working together with a phenomenal team of animators is a match made in heaven. The story is remarkably well-written, with a full half dedicated to introduce and develop Broly as a mentally troubled child who had to deal with so much pain during his life. The animation reaches its peak quality-wise, demonstrating that when time is given to the animators, their work can be a visual masterpiece. With such an intriguing backstory on the history of Saiyans and a brilliantly structured build-up to an epic fight between Broly, Goku, and Vegeta, there was still time to cherish the nostalgia with some nods to previous moments in the beloved saga, as well as some hilarious comedy bits.With more control over the use of CGI and visual effects, this could very well be one of 2019's best movies. It still can be, but the climactic final battle lost of a bit of its impact due to the overwhelming VFX which completely overcame the animation itself. The ending is predictable before we reach half-runtime, and the spoiler-heavy trailers didn't help to keep surprise as a factor. I have to repeat what almost every critic has been saying: if you're a fan of the saga and you kept up with Super, this will give you everything you want and more. If you're just a casual moviegoer or if you stopped watching after Z, it's better if you don't ""poison"" social media with opinions on a film that simply wasn't made for you.Thank you, Toriyama! Thank you for giving me the chance to see my favorite anime on the big screen for the first time, and for making it epic.","10/10"
"msbreviews","6 August 2017","The third chapter of the Planet of the Apes franchise is finally here! Rise and Dawn are great films, but War needs to end this trilogy perfectly, which is a very rare achievement in the history of cinema (i.e. the third movie of a trilogy to be the best) ... Well, War for the Planet of the Apes does what Return of the King did 14 years ago and it is the best film in this memorable reboot and one of the best (probably THE best) of the year!I can't find a single flaw with this movie. I really thought about every detail and there's only ONE thing that I can see others maybe faulting the film for it, which is some of the second act's pacing. Some new characters are introduced along the way and there is a period of time that some people mind find slow or boring ... For me, that's character development in its glory and it's also a massive build-up to a fulfilling climax in the third act.Don't be fooled by the title nor the trailers, you have to manage your expectations: this is not a war film. This is not an epic battle between humans and apes, which is something that I love about this movie: I didn't watch a single trailer, so I went totally blind into the theater. I assumed that I was going to watch an epic fight just by the beginning of the film, but it plays out in such an unconventional and emotional way that I found myself floored. It's jaw-dropping.Andy Serkis, man ... I don't even know what to say. The team that adds the visual effects to the apes are unbelievably talented ... There are so many close-ups of apes' faces and it's impossible for someone to say ""they're fake"" because they're not! They are so perfect that's impossible for me to look at them and not see a real ape. Andy Serkis deserves a freaking Oscar nomination as well as everyone in the motion capture team. It's unreal the amount of realism that they can pull off.Caesar continues to be the most powerful and emotional character that I've met since God knows how many years ago. He has a roller- coaster journey in terms of his feelings and I could definitely feel it: in his eyes, in his face, in all of his expressions and movements. It's a character that just became unforgettable and fortunately, he has a beautiful story about him and his journey told in three amazing films.Maurice (Karin Konoval) is one of my favorite characters from the trilogy and he gets some well-deserved scenes where he absolutely shines. The new characters are superb: Nova is portrayed by the spectacular Amiah Miller and Steve Zahn plays Bad Ape. She adds an astounding amount of depth to the story without saying a single word and she's able to be so compelling and captivating that when the emotional scenes go down, she elevates them to a whole other level. Bad Ape is where all could have gone wrong since he's the comic relief character in a very profound drama ... It works. Matt Reeves is able to guide this character perfectly, introducing him as a joke in just the right scenes and in just the right amount. One of the things that I faulted the other movies for was that the human characters didn't have that much interest and that I always wanted to be with Caesar. This time, the Colonel is someone that is given a very heartfelt story (even if it's through an exposition scene ... the ONLY one that I can count throughout the whole film), so when the third act begins I actually cared for Harrelson's character.Once again, the visuals are stunning, the film just looks amazing. However, the detail that makes this movie go from great to epic is, as always, its score. Michael Giacchino probably produced his best score to date and it elevated the film in such a powerful way. Most of the runtime, there's no dialogue (either there's sign language or pure silence), so the score had to be perfect in order for the scenes to be more complete ... and it is. I already added it to my Spotify playlist and I can't wait to listen to it over and over again. If some scenes are already emotional enough, this score turns them into something that I couldn't hold my tears from. More than once.The ending is so filled with emotion (I have no idea how many times have I written ""emotion"" or ""emotional"", but it's the perfect word to describe this film) that makes it the best ending to a trilogy that I've seen since The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings). It's such a powerful and fulfilling moment ... Honestly, after some research, I have no problems saying that this is the best reboot EVER done to a franchise since Nolan's The Dark Knight.So ... I think it's pretty obvious ...War for the Planet of the Apes gets my first A+ of 2017! Go watch it! Now! What are you waiting for?!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)","10/10"

"mt-95256","28 April 2018","TL;DRA phenomenal achievement - 10 years of films leading up to this has been worth itSimple story allowing so much to be packed inInfinity Stones are more than just dull McGuffinsA wildly different story and structure to most superhero filmsStructure more like a Game of Thrones episode - this works to its benefitThe ending is bold and brave - a real strength of the film as a wholeAll characters are fantastic - their interaction is the greatest joy of the movieNo one character hogs the film - everyone gets their fair share of screen-timeThanos is the greatest Marvel villain so farAbsolutely hilarious and very quotableSublime, varied and non-stop action that never feels like too muchSets up Avengers 4 very wellThe greatest Marvel film yet--------------------------------------------------------------Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","4/10"
"mts-78680","19 July 2017","Definitely the worst of the series and hopefully the last. Sadly, they'll probably try to milk this into another one. The action was disappointing but the graphics/ape visuals were on par with other movies.No clue why Hollywood must always make one sided conflicts where losers look incompetent just to make winners look brilliant. Personally it shows a lack of creative genius in their writing/directing. OR it could just be their way of ensuring movie is completed on schedule with weak plots? Do yourself a favor and wait for video or do like I did and see it at a matinée (which was still too much $$).","1/10"

"Muhammad29","19 February 2023","This is the biggest of the ""Ant-Man"" films, but if you think about it, the story arc of Scott evolved to the point where he deserved something really big on his own. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential. In that light, Quantumania is stellar! Great story, and flawless execution, makes this one the most epic ride since Endgame. Some funny moments, but nothing too hilarious or overbearing. The film doesn't have the nerve to wipe the smile off the audience's face like in ""Infinity War"" but still, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is a fun ride that both long-time fans and casual viewers will enjoy. The music score hits hard in some of the scenes, the conflict is imminent, and the final battle is really creative! One of the best villains so far in the MCU and this movie makes me incredibly excited to see where they take his character. Just remember to always look out for the little guy.","9/10"

I had no idea what was going on and the tedious CGI and probable impossible situations and loud music and interminable explosions made this a tortuous event to sit through.

"mursel-502-657523","25 November 2012","Life of Pi is a triumph visually - one of the most magical experiences I've ever had at the movies. Even more importantly, it's a triumph of a story.I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist. When I heard the words ""I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God"", I was suitably skeptical.The movie did not succeed in getting me to believe in God. However, the pivotal but ever-so-subtle dialog near the end really cemented why so many people the world over choose the target of their faith.Piscene asks ""Which story do you prefer?"" Not ""which story do you believe?"" or ""Which story do you think is true?"", just ""Which story do you prefer?"" I've seen other reviews of this move that refer to the ""twist"" ending. There is no twist here, just an incredibly well-presented allegory. There's also many reviews talking about the triumph of endurance and human spirit. Those indeed are present in the story, but not so important as the central point - the crux of the matter.""Which story do you prefer?"" The answer of course is a perfect allegory of religion. The fundamental stories are similar no matter which characters are in the pivotal roles.""Which story do you prefer?"" As Pi answers, ""And so it is with God."" A faith-shaking thought indeed.Depending on how you see the world and religion's place in it, the question may affirm or cause questions of your own faith. Is your religion's story true? Or just preferred? And more importantly, does it matter? What this movie drove home for me was that religions all have the same benefits and by extension, they all have the same flaws.Which story do you prefer? To Ang Lee, Yann Martel, David Magee and all involved in bringing this story to the screen, thank you! It is so refreshing to be viscerally, philosophically and intellectually entertained all at the same time.","8/10"

"musicista-38011","29 October 2023","I had high hopes for this one, despite the geriatric state of my beloved main actor, but -alas!- I was quite disappointed.I shan't spoil anything, so all I say is that there are plot holes IMHO (is this news anyway?) and the choice of cast could have been wiser. By this I mean the female lead role, which I didn't manage to like despite my best efforts.If you are looking for some not-too-bad entertainment, this movie might be for you, after all it contains all the right tropes, more or less.The ending managed to be more entertaining (to me) than the rest of the movie, to be fully honest.Kudos to Harrison Ford for saving all that was salvageable in the movie, and of course to John Williams, without whose music many movies would have flopped royally.","7/10"
"mvedprakasha","28 March 2013","World is a zoo bearing many species of the life where each individual witnesses the minds and souls of others which actually represents the universal truth. Opening with the soothing voice the Indian classical music of Bombay Jayashree gives us the calmness that exists in the blue planet. The takeover of the story slowly grabs the impetus in the traditional method of the Irfan khan recollecting the olden days as though inculcating the thought process of mind which always moves back either into the history or toggles into the future and never stays in the present. The years of 1950's of newly born India's is well thought of to be a subject matter. The story giving a philosophical glimpse starts with Lord Krishna who symbolizes the ultimate bliss of life throughout his journey of life, by a way of circumscribing the entire Universe in his tiny little mouth is a valid way of representing the Pi responding to it while his brother doesn't. The interests of pi and his brother are varied throughout the movie. The hunger for knowledge awakened the pi while his brother was attracted by the fantasies of the world, cleanly represented by the holy water in the church. The senses of hearing of Allah did not affect Ravi but the listening Allah touched the ears of Pi. The concept of Absurdity is also meaningfully taken into the story by the introduction of Albert Camus to the pi. The worldly fascination doesn't give the ""Anand(i)"" is very well depicted in the movie. The concentration of the fact of Darwin's theory of ""struggle for existence"" is shown at every step of the movie such as his father's business mind where he thinks to move to Canada, and also by the fact in the life boat where at the point where he kills the fishes to feed himself and the fierce Richard parker. The conflict in the mind about the killing of the fishes (other species) for the one's own survival on this planet is the lively truths of past, present and the futuristic tendencies of the world. The colors about the godly islands which shall mark the origin of the all the energy which starts with the birth of cold and healthy water lakes along the sunrise and dawns with the water being acidic in nature turning wild to end the life of many species also seems relevant to life. The realization of the nature's thunder storm-god paradox is brought evidently to depict the curiosity (JIGNYASA) to know the world, one self and God .The simile of Tiger to that of the soul of the pi is very interesting. Life is a journey of the body and the soul in this planet to evolve or reach a destined destination. On finishing the journey body shall cry for the loss of the soul, nevertheless the soul is liberated without even bidding the good bye, becomes one with the universal eternal energy. The tiger which represents the depth of the pi, departs without any hesitation deep into the forests brings the end of the 25 years story in 3 hours. The making of the movie and the 3d effects and photography has really made it worth the golden statues. The editing and the Foley have made it supportive to the great Oscars.","9/10"
"MxS7HGS","28 January 2024","Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.","9/10"

"myblueblazer","22 November 2023","Review: I think some of the reviews are a bit harsh. Though I agree the movie has a good bit of flaws, I thought it was decent.

The quantumverse is Bizzarre, yet colorful to look at.Paul Rudd once again proves why he IS Ant-Man. I love that he just wants to save the people he loves (his girlfriend and daughter) and not caring about being the grand kal-el savior of the world.I love how similar Evangeline Lilly looks to the comic Wasp Now! Same crop haircut and everything!Michael Douglas and Michele Pfeiffer are once again always great to watch as the veteran heroes and mentors.Cassie Lang comes into her own as a superhero! I love her suit that she designed herself, but what is her super name? (She was called Stature in the comics)in the words of Woody Harrison.... BILL FREAKIN MURRAY!! I loved his small role as Krylar! Even though we didn't see him that much.Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) Returns as a new enemy...MODOK! It is wierd to see him as a deformed Giant head, but he looks like he almost came straight from the comics!Man, I have to tell you, Johnathan Majors just KILLs IT as Kang the Conqueror! I like how regal, powerful, menacing and hi tech he is. I think Stan Lee and Jack Kirby would have been proud to see their big Villian realized!The CGI definitely was not ""super"" but it wasn't entirely Bad.I will say that I wish the ending wasn't as anti-climactic, and that there was a better teaser for the upcoming Kang War.Conclusion: Its up to you whether you want to like this movie. It's not the greatest start to MCU Phase V, but it's enjoyable enough to stay tuned. (Can't say the same for the Eternals Movie. Lol)End credits Scene: COUNCIL OF KANG? ONE THOUSAND KANGS?! LOKI?

"myema77","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.","1/10"

"Mysterygeneration","21 December 2021","Where ""Infinity War"" created havoc, ""Avengers: Endgame"" promised closure. The film is jam-packed with re-enactments of previous films' relationships. It practically requires that viewers do their homework by watching (or rewatching) a dozen previous films. The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism. It establishes that whoever possesses the six all-powerful Infinity Stones may accomplish almost anything by just snapping their fingers. Because there is so much territory to cover in the film, it skips over introductions and presents Captain Marvel's entrance as a foregone conclusion.","10/10"
"Mysterygeneration","22 February 2023","Even if it's on an incredibly small scale, something significant is happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third installment of the Paul Rudd-starring series about a divorced father turned ex-con with a remarkable shrinking suit, Quantumania is also the first movie in Phase 5 of the MCU's overarching, 31 movies and 8 TV shows strong storyline. And it is important. Even if understanding the implications would necessitate a doctorate in molecular physics.Focusing on the pleasant San Francisco day makes it much simpler to imagine Scott and the rest of the lovely blended Lang-Pym-van-Dyne family enjoying their happy post-Blip life. That is, until they are drawn into the ""Quantum Realm"" of the subatomic realm by a teenager fiddling with a MacGuffin device. Why does that matter? One benefit is that Michelle Pfeiffer will get more screen time since she does a great job of putting all the crazy science fiction in emotional reality in her role as the original quantum investigator Janet van Dyne. She is just a working mother who feels guilty and believes that protecting her family by hiding her own previous traumas will help.The Quantum Realm is unquestionably worth visiting, with its microfauna forests and pulsating glowing creatures. Star Wars parallels that were sparked by the trailer are neither unfair nor off-putting, but this prolonged stay does rob us of some of the core Ant-Man movie pleasures: there are no recognisable, everyday objects to size up or down. Whatever strange but unexpectedly prevalent miniaturist kink ""smol"" sights appeal to is thus painfully unfulfilled.Also, there is no room for beloved side characters like Agent Woo, played by Randall Park, or Luis, Lang's former cellmate, with his heist-planning antics and famously drawn-out tales. Everything must make way for Jonathan Majors' eagerly awaited debut as Kang the Conqueror, Phase Five's new Big Bad.Which leads us to the crucial question that may affect your upcoming multiplex visits: Does Kang bang? He does, indeed. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver was an emotionally charged it-boy, and Majors possesses that same energy. Observe how, even while he throttles his victims, his eyes frequently become wet with pity. The MCU moves forward relentlessly through ""phases"" and ""sagas,"" but what's the point if there's no opportunity to sit, think, and have a laugh with old friends? Kang would undoubtedly grasp this fundamental complaint about this effective movie product in his more melancholy moments.","2/10"
"mysteryvoiceman","4 May 2018","Ok I know rating a movie like this 2 star is going to seem like hate, but let me explain. 
1) I feel like tony stark is an arrogant douchebag and I don't like that he's stronger that other ""super""heroes 2) I'm not a fan of the over used plot device of ""I must kill my loved one to save the universe"". It's just fake tension most of the time and because most of the main characters are wearing main character armor, they either don't get killed or revived anyway 3) the ending didn't wrap up any loose ends at all and isn't really dramatic anyway 4) I miss when Spider-Man was cool and not some lame dork iron man bossed around 5) the hulk just didn't want to participate in the movie for unknown reasons and he's also one of my favorites 6) I didn't like that the ""good"" guys just gave the bad guy the rock he wanted... twice 7) where was the ""orange"" black panther character as he was my favorite one ? 8) how did that one good guy with the rock in his head, vision, survive when his neurosurgery was incomplete ? 9) why did we keep saving that one girl, to just throw her off a cliff? And she was also one of my favorites10) the dialogue was weak in the movie as a whole and most of the ""comedic"" moments weren't funny outside of Star-Lord, who was great by the way 11) the dialogue was weird between between Gamora and thanos. Why did she never understand how he felt about her ? That made the endingish scene weird because she didn't understand she was going to get thrown off the cliff until he grabbed her","1/10"
"Naama_Newport","28 August 2023","No story, nothing makes sense. Absolutely unwatchable.It's really insulting to the audience...1. They didn't decide if this quantum world is just very small, or like a parallel universe.2. Why are there people in this quantum world. Wouldn't it make more sense if there's only creatures, and that's why janet is special and everyone recognizes her?3. The people down there, even if they are all in one tribe, look different, dress different.. Even have different features... So... It really looks like they just used whatever costumes they had left in storage...I D I O T I C, tiring, exhausting, annoying, piece of cinema. Probably one of top 5 worst things I've ever seen...

The story is awesome, the plot great, the CGI best and the cast is super beautiful!LOP is a visual masterpiece and Ang Lee has left no stone unturned for creating his magnum opus. Suraj Sharma has done his job perfectly.LOP captures your eyes during the whole 130 minutes and keeps you hooked on. And with 3D the fun is even more. The beginning and the end are not that great as the middle part involving the 16 year old, a Bengal Tiger and the Pacific Ocean. This is unbelievable.Nature is highlighted in LOP and I like it. It shows us all the things about the nature that we don't know or haven't seen! This is amazing!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"namashi_1","26 November 2012","Based on Yann Martel's 2001 novel of the same name, Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' is a Stunning motion-picture, that delivers in high regard. Not only is it visually stunning, but its also solidly written, fabulously directed & beautifully acted. A Big Winner! 'Life of Pi' Synopsis: A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor ... a fearsome Bengal tiger.David Magee's Adapted Screenplay is solid & offers nail-biting moments all through the adventure. Ang Lee's is a master at his craft & he directs this adventure fabulously. The Special Effects are outstanding, among the finest I've ever seen. The use of 3D is remarkable. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are marvelous.Performance-Wise: Suraj Sharma as Pi, delivers a compelling performance. He takes us through this unbelievable adventure & delivers at every step. Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi, is splendid, as usual. The Ever Terrific Tabu is a pleasure to watch. Adil Hussain is perfect. Gérard Depardieu barely has any role.On the whole, 'Life of Pi' is a must watch.","9/10"
"namashi_1","29 April 2018","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","1/10"
"namashi_1","8 October 2017","The third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot series, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a terrific film, that is grim & thought-provoking, and bravely pushes the Blockbuster Genre, by offering more soul than gimmicks. With a Sterling, Oscar-worthy Performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the apes, to a Screenplay that is dark & powerful & Deft Direction, this recent box-office & critical smash is among the year's best films! 'War for the Planet of the Apes' Synopsis: After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a tale on love, hate, revenge & survival. And in a world where Presidents behave like dictators & discriminate the minorities, this Apes versus Humans spell-binder comes close to the current state of times we live in & questions hate & violence with thundering ferocity. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is brave enough to remain a grim story on a leader broken & consumed in hate, ready to protect his misunderstood tribe by a sadist & ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson, in an electrifying performance). Its disturbing & powerful story on Caesar's fight, with a mad-load of violence & thought-provoking confrontations, that are SURE to give your goose-pimples. Its power-packed stuff.Mark Bomback & Matt Reeves's Screenplay is excellent. The Writing is super-strong & makes for a solid third installment. Reeves's Direction is intense to the core. This is Reeves at his finest, as a writer & director. Michael Seresin's Cinematography captures the carnage, with astonishing results. William Hoy & Stan Salfas's Editing is top-notch. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. Michael Giacchino's Score is enchanting, as always. Performance-Wise: Andy Serkis needs to be awarded. His return as Caesar in a yet another motion-capture performance, defines emotion. Serkis is simply superb, enacting the bruised & broken hero with gut-wrenching honesty. Has the Academy been sleeping? I mean, how can one not include Serkis in the finest performances of the year? Give him his due, Nominate Serkis for his impeccable work in 'War for the Planet of the Apes', it would only prove to be a rich moment in your history. Second in command is Woody Harrelson, who puts the screen on fire. In one of his scariest roles, the Thespian portrays a villain that's hard to forget. The TREMENDOUS Steve Zahn is extraordinary & adds the much needed relief in the intense proceedings. Karin Konoval, also, is marvelous. Rest lend incredible support.On the whole, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is A Mighty Winner! Don't Miss It.","9/10"
"namob-43673","16 February 2023","I had no intention to see this movie, but sometimes walking around with the wrong people they lure you into things you should have avoided. This movie I should have avoided.So the good things is that the visuals are (mostly) great, the acting is decent, and we get a few new interesting characters in a good natural way although I assume some will complain about that. And... uhm... well, the costumes are pretty nice...Most of the rest is meh, boring sludge, and badly written. I am not necessarily stating this is a bad movie. However strange it may sound, looking at the 2/10 I give this, there is a decent movie here somewhere. The problem is that around this decent movie is a layer of nonsense, a lot of propaganda and a basic premiss which is beyond contempt.Worst for me though is the 25yo daughter (how did she get that old?) and the actress in question. Horribly written Mary Sue character that very few will like.I cannot even tell you how badly done this movie is. Marvel has really dropped it. My last hope is The Marvels since I loved the first Captain Marvel Movie. If that is as bad as this and the previous movies Marvel has insulted us with that is it for me. Out. Permanently.Marvel have thrown away all the goodwill, and this movie is a perfect example of that.","8/10"
"namob-43673","30 June 2023","There are four really bad things about this movie. First of Phoebe Waller-Bridge who should not be acting, and especially not in any high budget movies. The disrespect of the character of Indiana Jones and the franchise which is a big annoyance throughout except perhaps the first 15min. Third the editing which is very strange, and almost ruins the movie. But the fourth problem is the big one; and that is how boring this movie is.If they had replaced Phoebe, or used the CIA agent played by Shaunette Renée Wilson instead that would have solved so much. The writing is very condescending, almost hateful towards Indiana. Clearly written for the amusement of Darth Kennedy. But this too could have easily been solved. And if they had solved those two issues and rewritten the storyline just a tiny bit so to make it less boring, this would actually not be a bad movie. Might have even been a great one.A few tiny other issues with the CGI, some scenes that does not make any sense and a few side characters that feels forced into the movie. But overall the four big problems mention above is the issue.Everything else is pretty good. Music score is great, costumes, set pieces are all good. Cinematography (except for editing and CGi) is excellent. The acting, with Phoebe as the shining bad exception, is also excellent.But, as mention this is as boring as watching paint dry on a golf-course. All the other stuff can almost be forgiven, but when you are watching your phone, thinking of what to have for dinner, and contemplating going out to get vodka to better enjoy the movie, well then you have a failed movie. A boring, failed movie. This is Indiana Jones, how can it be boring? But it is.I cannot really say this is a horrible movie, because it isn't. I have seen a lot worse, even this week I have seen worse. But this cannot be watched without a pillow to sleep on and it cannot be recommended by anyone who like qualitative movies. I give this a very generous 4/10 because its not bad-bad and because everything else but the 4 points above has pretty high quality. But if you like the character of Dr Jones, you cannot watch this. Be warned.","1/10"
"nancyldraper","30 April 2019","After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}","10/10"
"narine_tevosyan","15 February 2019","I've watched this movie twice, and I understood it both times differently. This story touches various themes, and I think that after each viewing you focus on one thing. Thus, I think that it is about survival, faith, and friendship. All these aspects are shown with the help of the main character, who had gone through all these difficulties. In particular, in this movie, we see a strong character, who managed to survive the hardships, suffering, pain, and loss in the Pacific Ocean. During the whole this period we learn a lot of lessons, which are crucial for our knowledge. One of them is that we should always have faith, even when we are in a hopeless situation. We see how Pi believed that God had been protecting him during the whole time and we really see that God didn't forget him and he managed to survive there. Moreover, we see that his character also played a big role in his survival. Pi didn't give up hope, and he kept moving. This factor shows that it is essential not to give up on your dreams and give up on life. In addition, I want to say that I liked the part when this movie showed that the world believes someone for what they want to hear, not for reality. This is, unfortunately, a real truth.","9/10"

"nathangoffnett","3 March 2023","I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.Score: 38%
Verdict: Poor.","7/10"
"nathanielkalatsky","8 June 2023","This movie is not what I expected. Like Morbius the trailers were very misleading, but in the best way possible. Morbius' trailer thankfully hid the parts about him morbing so it could be a surprise. Every event in this trailer happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. After that the chai comes. Spiderman india is the hero of this movie. He introduces the chai tea or should I say tea tea, and he is the one who saves the day. There are so many jokes about Chai and it is very dramatic when miles drowns in Chai. Some of the jokes can be very rude to chai lovers. Its all in good fun though. Luckily one spiderverse bought spiderman india's chai and they all said chai tea at the same time. It annoyed the Chai monster villain who knew they were saying tea tea. While he was distracted spidermanindia drank him. Like how lego dimensions is the best lego game spiderman spiderverse is the best movie. I cant wait for morb. I also had got some chai tea while i was watching the movie. I love chai tea. I was very insulted at some parts despite the positives, but luckily I had chai to keep me entertained. I love chai. The actual story was definitly lacking however. I also think a lot of the themes could have been handled better. Miles should have probably gotten more focus which I wasn't thinking about before because I love chai. I actually would not recommend this movie. You should only see this movie if you love chai and you are drinking it while watching the movie. Actually don't watch the movie at all because it will insult any chai lovers out there. Overall following a great first movie, unfortunatly the sequel was very bad. Writing review is my passion.","10/10"

"Nayr39","3 February 2019","Dragonball movies have always had their issues, they're generally just poorly written and paced fan service doses for people to enjoy fun what if scenarios. This one takes that and pushes it to it's limit but without actually developing an interesting antagonist or any ounce of suspense around it. Like every Dragonball movie you know going in none of the characters are at threat, the planet will be fine and all will revert back to normal at the end of it. So the core of this movie has to come from the action and the character moments. This version of Broly is superior but ultimately just as shallow despite rewriting his character and making him more sympathetic. The writing during these moments is still weak at best, it's clearly catering to children and potential newcomers alike with awkward overly explanatory dialogue and at other times hitting you with stuff so simply or poorly written you can't help but roll your eyes. Thankfully there are many visual treats here, but all as formulaic as ever, you will see our main characters start out at their normal base level, then slowly ramp up with increasing levels of strength and set pieces until something inevitably happens to push the fight over the edge and end it. Unlike most Dragonball movies we get a different ending, our antagonist is actually saved and given a second shot at life, but on his prison of a home planet instead and our characters arch rival is just let go to kill and torture whoever he wants, despite Goku supposedly being a goodhearted person who would never let anyone on Earth suffer, but hey, random Frieza henchmen and anyone he decides to kill as he travels through space? Ay okay in Goku's book. Moment's like this make any character moments that need to shine fall flat, nothing is consistent, everything is convenient, references and callbacks like the Krilin/Namek moment or the fusion dance nonsense is all here in it's boring glory. Nothing feels fresh except for the fight choreography and animation. Which if you really want to just see beautiful animation, it's okay, but you could just go watch Redline. Instead you get a repetitive predictable slog of a beatdown with no twists or anything to worry about. It's a retread of a existing movie that does very little new. Watch if you are a massive fan of Super or for some reason enjoy brainless animation but other than that steer clear. There's not much of worth here sadly and far to many repeated mistakes that for some reason can just not be fixed even after the many years this franchise has exised.","6/10"
"nbarnes-72465","6 July 2023","Im a very big Indiana Jones fan. And I found this film to be just okay...its not the disaster everyone is making it out to be...but its also not a super great film like some others are saying...its just right in the middle of just being okay.Harrison Ford as Indy is what you want. Nothing more needs to be said. Even at 80 he is still Indy.Morgan- Phoebe Waller.....shes been a constant complaint from everyone...and I tend to agree. She was definitely very off putting in the film. She had her moments but for the most part I found her incredibly distracting and over the top with her acting.Mads Mikkelson....he rules and thats all I need to say. The dude doesnt miss in his roles. Even though I wish he was a little more menacing in the film...I dont think they really showed how evil of a villain he can be...so I think that was a miss there.I couldve done without the Short Round replacement. I feel like that character offered nothing to the film and was pointless.The storyline I thought was fine for an Indiana Jones film in 2023.Overall its not a horrible film...its definitely better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull...and id say almost better than Temple of Doom(I know im in the minority with that film...)But thats about it...it was just okay.","6/10"

"NDbportmanfan","17 February 2019","Having watched the two back to back; I can safety say this one is better. The problem I had with the original is that they tried to incorporate too many characters into the battles. 1993 had 8 while the new version just had the main two on the battlefield. That leaves plenty of time to actually tell Broly's story in a meaningful way. Which is done fantastically I might add as the flashbacks even help new viewers understand the lore.The fight scenes are very long but the visuals are so amazing that I certainly lost track of time as I was marveling at the beauty. I also was happy with Broly's power growth throughout the film as it felt more realistic than the original movie.What I didn't like about it was a lot of the jokes. I know Goku is the comic relief of the series but I do not enjoy when other characters like Frieza act goofier than him.This movie revitalized my love for the series (It died off after watching GT) and I am excited to see the other movies connected to the Super series.","6/10"

Except for Cassie, arrested for being a social warrior in between building a device to contact the Quantum Realm. And no sooner does Janet issue a panicked warning to disconnect it than it sucks them all into the Quanum Realm. Where a war is going on.This Ant-Man movie has an entirely feel to its predecessors. There is much less humour, non-stop action, less plot and a very streamlined narrative. I don't want to say much more for fear of spoilering a fairly obvious fact about this movie and Phase 5 of the MCU. On the negative side, this has a place in the Marvel plan without having a strong identity of its own: it doesn't have the warmth it needs. It almost makes up for it with non-stop eye candy/action, but not quite. And even the eye candy seems terribly familiar, being inspired/derivative by other movies.Bill Murray's cameo is pointless.I enjoyed this, but it should have been better: it is somewhat hamstrung by the function it was created to perform in the MCU.","7/10"

And the action subgenre ""You shouldn't have messed with someone who has a friend/family member with a very particular set of skills"" is always enormously satisfying when well handled.And it is well handled here, both the hand-to-hand stuff, and the broader set pieces.The scammers in this case aren't based in Mumbai but are much closer to home, and there are some fun plot twists. The supporting cast are good (Josh Hutcherson is very effective as the chief (or is he?) baddie).This is a satisfying action thriller, with an ending which is about 5 minutes too abrupt - there are several characters/threads which deserved a bit more wrap-up.","7/10"
"neil-476","28 December 2012","Young Indian lad Pi (telling his story in flashback) finds himself stranded in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger in the middle of the Pacific.The book simply didn't appeal to me. The trailers did, however, so off I went to take in Ang Lee's latest offering, a strange affair telling a story which falls midway between mythology, Baron Munchausen, and a Reader's Digest True-Life Adventure.To be honest, the story, such as it is, is almost inconsequential, albeit quite enough to hold the interest throughout, and certainly sufficient to hang the stunning visuals on. I think the author may well have been aiming to stimulate some sort of spiritual or philosophical musings in his audience. This film never achieved that with me - I am simply too shallow and rooted in material reality - but I was blown away by how visually stunning this film is, and I recommend it heartily on that basis alone. There came a point when I - quite literally - suddenly became aware that my mouth was hanging open.Also, see this in 3D. It is one of a handful of films where 3D is an essential part of the experience of appreciating the movie.","6/10"
"neil-476","9 May 2018","The third film in this series of motion-capture CGI reboot movies has a simple plot. Two groups are struggling to survive, but one believes the other must be destroyed. At the heart of the conflict are the two leaders. Intelligent chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) is familiar to us from Dawn and Rise, the two earlier films. The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is the new antagonist, in charge of many soldiers and much weaponry, and determined to wipe out the apes.Woody Harrelson is best known as a comedic actor, but there is nothing funny about The Colonel. The character is well-written, with a strong and sympathetic motivation for his actions. The scene where he explains this is truly chilling. It shows you his human pain and the inhuman result of it. Harrelson is as good in this as he has ever been.The Colonel and Caesar are well matched as antagonist and protagonist. Both characters have some justification, which gives their conflict meaning. Andy Serkis doesn't just wear the mo-cap suit as Caesar, he gives a performance of subtlety and power. This is another screen character, like Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings, worthy of Oscar nomination. It's a shame that the Academy still doesn't have a category for Best Mo-capped Performance.There is a big chunk of prison break material at the two-thirds mark. It is very entertaining and action packed, but you've probably seen it before. The Great Escape and Toy Story 3 come to mind. This film is probably the most action-oriented of the three movies, and it is all well staged. You never think ""Those apes are amazing creations"" while you are watching, you just accept them as screen reality. Only afterwards do you realise that the apes riding horses, integrating with people, snow, fire and water, and giving solid dramatic performances, don't actually exist at all outside a computer. The interaction between reality and digital creation is photo-realistically perfect.I thought the filmmakers had been a little too cute with name-checking the Apes history. We have references to Cornelius, Zira and Blue Eyes from the 1960s Apes films. Then we have orangutan Maurice, named for Maurice Evans who played orangutan Dr Zaius in those films. Worse, we have a little girl given the name Nova after a character who originally appeared in Pierre Boulle's source novel Monkey Planet in 1963. Nova has little plot relevance. A better character is Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) a well-written character who is funny and sad, and moves the story along.This film definitely provides closure for this trilogy, but there is scope for the Apes' tale to continue, and Andy Serkis has said as much. So it may be that the Law of Hollywood will apply - if it make enough money, a sequel may happen. But, if it doesn't, this film is a good way to close things.","10/10"
"neilbowers","20 February 2023","Having read the reviews from the so called critics. You'd think that this is the worst ever Marvel film in the franchise.However, please ignore these critics because clearly they'd been watching a different film to what I watched this afternoon.Since we last saw Scott Lang a lot has changed in his life. He can't walk down the street without people recognising him and he has also brought out a book about himself being an Avenger.Scotts daughter is a chip off the old block in that she has been in and out of prison. However, rather than steel things Cassie uses her new found knowledge to do good.This is where we find that during the 5 years of the blip Cassie and Hank Pym have been building a contraption that fires a signal down into the Quantom Realm. Which as we find out later isn't a good idea.Having opened the door way via the contraption to the Quantom Realm out heroes are dragged in but split up and spend time looking for each other.The quantom realm is like no other and they soon discover that other unkown species live in this realm but live in fear of an individual.When they find out that Janet Pym is back things look bleak because having spent 30 years in the realm and managing to escape things are not good.There is a short but funny cameo from Bll Murray who meets a sticky ending which leads to the introduction of Kang (Johnathan Majors) who is hell bent on conquering all the realms across the multi verse and has already conquered the quantom realm.Once he realises that Janet is back he goes on the offensive to crush the rebellion that is beginning to build up and seak his revenge for Janet leaving the realm with him still in it.Helping Kang conquer the universe is an old adversary from Ant Man, Darren Cross who has now become M. O. D. O. K. (Mechanised Organism Designed Only for Killing) and he does have some of the funnier lines in the film as well.The characters within the Quantom Realm are funny at times and the relationship between Cassie and Scott is really sweet and it also seems as though Scott has gained some respect from Hank Pym too.I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, as you'll just have to wait until you go and watch it or wait for around 6 months before it appears on Disney +.The graphics etc. Are really good representing the Quantom Realm. The acting isn't as bad as some of the reviews will make you believe.It is a bit slow in parts but to be honest i've seen worse films in the Marvel Universe (Thor: Love and Thunder) being one. But, it's a solid start to phase 5. Critics have no idea, It's a really good film.","6/10"

"nemesis2000-2","19 February 2023","The movie is what it is; just for fun. Quantumania is more comedy, drama, weighing more on comedy. Again the comedy hurts the weight of the story in this film as the intense story with the main villain needing more emphasis. The setup in some parts of the film did in fact heightened the gravity of the situation, but events that followed downplayed everything. Because of who the villain is they could of made him just as strong in the comics, but downplayed him like how they did with Gorr the God Butcher in Thor Love and Thunder.Is it entertaining? In my opinion, yes. Was it a spectacle/memorable? To a degree. There are some parts where you could tell writers were writing in filler material. Without that material the gravity of who the characters are remains the same. In my eyes Quantumania has a similar feel to some 90's films I grew up with that were there for fun.","7/10"
"Neptune165","2 February 2024","In the latest Jason Statham venture, 'The Beekeeper,' the film takes an audacious swing at action but ends up missing the mark by a wide margin. The acting is staggeringly subpar, setting Statham on an unintended pedestal that makes him seem Oscar-worthy by comparison. It's as if the casting was deliberately skewed to elevate his performance through the mere juxtaposition of talent-or the lack thereof. The action sequences limp along without the slightest hint of vigor or excitement, the anticipated gore is conspicuously absent, leaving much to be desired for fans of the genre. The punches, both literal and metaphorical, lack any semblance of impact, making each fight scene feel more like a choreographed middle -school dance than a battle. To add insult to injury, the dialogue is so laughably inept that it unwittingly becomes the only source of entertainment, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Leaving audiences wondering what could have been if it had managed to harness even a fraction of its star's renowned kinetic energy.","3/10"
"Neptune165","2 February 2024","Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse.","3/10"

"niallh-66092","3 July 2023","Who was this film made for? Who wanted to see a depressed Indy hobbling around while a self righteous know it all spends the entire runtime reminding him how old he is? Was this film made for an audience of exclusively Kathleen Kennedy?And who decided to put Pheobe Waller Bridge in this movie? I genuinely feel like Disney is desperate for this girl to become a thing, but she is just unlikeable. And it doesn't help when you have her play an insufferable character who constantly makes 2023 comments in a movie set in the 60s, you may as well have told her to wink at the camera. I wanna say anyone else in the role couldve done a better job, but I'm not even sure about that. The character is just awful.Also how many times do I need to get excited for a villain played by Mads Mikkelson for him to be yet again wasted? I'm amazed he doesnt get sick of it himself. Dont bother with this one. Its not worth your time.","6/10"
"nicar127","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.
(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)
CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.

"nicholasjohnmillsellis","13 January 2024","""The Beekeeper"" explodes onto the screen as an action-packed extravaganza that effortlessly secures its place as a must-watch film. This cinematic masterpiece skillfully intertwines adrenaline-fueled sequences with a compelling narrative, making it more than just a visual treat. The film's heart lies in its intricately crafted storyline, which is as engaging as its high-octane action scenes.The brilliance of ""The Beekeeper"" is further elevated by outstanding performances. The lead actor delivers a powerhouse portrayal of the protagonist, seamlessly blending vulnerability with an indomitable spirit. Supporting characters add depth and dimension, enriching the story's tapestry with their unique contributions.","5/10"
"nickgray-12862","27 April 2019","So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good.","7/10"
"nickmesafilms","8 December 2012","Known as the one man who will take various risks of making a movie out of almost every single film genre imaginable, Ang Lee, of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" fame, directs his latest hit, ""Life of Pi"", based on the popular novel of the same name. It's that rare movie that will transport audiences into a world unlike no other, succeeding to entertain in both visual style and story. This is one of the most memorable, and one of the very best films of the whole year. ""Life of Pi"" tells the brave story of a young teen nicknamed ""Pi"", whom ends up on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, accompanied by a ferocious Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker (I know, it's weird). But I know what you're wondering, ""How did these two unfortunate souls ended up in this mess in the first place?"". Well, without spoiling anything, it's told through the point of view of older Pi, played by Irrfan Khan, as he tells a writer his entire life story, from his experiences at his family zoo, to a massive shipwreck during a journey to Canada for Pi and his family to start a new life, and how it lead to a situation considered impossible where Pi, as a teenager, got stuck on a lifeboat for weeks, with a tiger! Filmed in gorgeously breathtaking 3-D technology, ""Life of Pi"" is one absolute visual marvel. Director Ang Lee has thrown in some of the most beautiful images ever seen on the silver screen, and uses these images as his own unique way to tell the story. I recommend that everybody should see this movie in the theater, in the 3-D format, on the largest screen possible. It's a better way to experience this visual spectacle with such a massive scope. From a technical standpoint, ""Life of Pi"" succeeds in the use of cinematography, editing, and visual effects. But from a performance standpoint, while Irffan Khan does one of his best performances as older Pi, the scene-stealing breakthrough performance comes from Suraj Sharma, who does a rather brilliant job in capturing the heroism of young Pi, while at the same time, trying to communicate with a computer-generated tiger. It's a performance that I hope will score him his first ever Best Actor nomination. His relationship with this tiger is something to enjoy to watch unfold on screen. Their various face-offs with each other show the accurate profession of animals between humans. Although sharing complete loath between each other in the beginning, we find a strange friendship somewhere, as well. This movie delivers every human emotion to the audience, whether making you laugh, cry, or giving you a strange feeling of hope. At a well-paced 127-minute running time, ""Life of Pi"" is one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had. From start to finish, Ang Lee has brought me on board for an incredible ride, while finishing off with an ending that will definitely leave a smile on your face. The incredible visuals, the spell-binding cinematography and editing, the stand-out performance from Suraj Sharma, Ang Lee's masterful directing, and the movie itself, are all worthy of Oscar consideration. ""Life of Pi"", in my review, ""visually enhancing, a masterful journey"".","9/10"
"nickraman-27699","18 January 2019","Its been 9 months since we last saw Goku and the Z-fighters on screen (as of this writing, the dub is roughly near the start of the Tournament of Power saga.) These 9 months left DB fans restless and anxious as the previous DB films (later retconned into the Super's Beerus/Resurrection F sagas.)Sure Battle of Gods & Resurrection F were solid fan serviced films because of the franchise's dub reputation, but were they really great DB films? The last DB film I enjoyed was Fusion Reborn and that wasn't in-universe canon as was many of the Z films.But coming back to Super's take on Broly, its the best DB movie that actually beefs up (pun unintended) Broly's backstory instead of limiting him to a 1-note antagonist. Here, its refreshing to see the makers retell the origins story of the triad saiyan warriors (Goku/Vegeta/Broly) and their bout with Frieza (some carryovers from the Bardock Z special are adeptly left-in but hey, it works. ) It's also refreshing not hearing ""Kakarott"" grunted by Broly every 5 minutes in this as opposed to the 8th movie (yes, that film and their ""sequels"" have not aged well despite being ""a DB film, chuck your logic at the door excuse.)Its really nice having Vegeta get first dibs on battling Broly at the start, something the series lacked in before. Also, the pace is frantic without loitering around in stare downs and verbal diarrhea our characters are infamous for. The incredible special mention goes to Naohiro Shintani's art and animation work. Yamamuro's design were not a sight for these eyes. Not only do the fight movements look seamless and glorious visually, but it seems the production was able to keep it consistent throughout (as opposed to Yamamuro's dimensional take on the heroes marred with many shades of color. The shades seen here are fitting given the Z-manga style of keeping-it-simple-stupid.)The surprise fusion finale was fitting and smart of Toei/Toriyama to pack in given how Broly is a popular character in the west (as of this writing, this limited Eng dub release made 7 million on opening day. Thats the third highest since Resurrection F's lifetime here (8 million).) The open-ended finale of Broly sure gives hope that Goku may need to call should the need arise.Any blemishes? The origin retcon retelling of the saiyan races (particularly Goku's departure to Earth) feels a bit iffy now but given's Toriyama's lack of memory, it may be a bitter pill to swallow for fans.Still, the money coming in Japan & its limited run worldwide, DB is certainly not dead. Given the roller coaster of the word ""hiatus"" being tossed around in the past year, its a matter of time before DBS returns to airwaves. Preferably with Shintani helming the shows new direction.Any day now Toei. We're waiting.","10/10"
"nickrissmeyer","13 August 2017","War for The Planet of The Apes blows the first two films of the trilogy out of the water by a long shot. This film was a huge surprise for me. I was expecting an okay, fun to watch blockbuster action movie with Apes and people just shooting each other for 2 hours. The film blew me away. This is by far one of the best Hollywood block buster movies I've seen in recent memory. It is jam packed with heart and emotion and is a literal emotional roller-coaster start to finish. The film touches on themes of slavery and the divide of species and draws parallels with lots of current social issues. The motion capture acting is incredible and the character models are so lifelike now that you forgot they aren't actual apes. Andy Serkis is incredible along with the other motion capture actors. Woody Harrelson's character was the weakest by far but he still feels rooted in the story and the universe of the planet of the apes.I can't even begin to understand all the terrible reviews this movie is getting on IMDb. Anyone who didn't like this has unfortunately been poisoned by the modern block buster explosions and no substance virus that has been running rampant for years. This movie is full of heart and a genuine respect for this franchise and it's characters and story. There's nothing about this movie that was not meticulously crafted.","6/10"
"nickryan-44535","6 June 2023","Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.","7/10"

The amount of callbacks and references throughout was a delight, and none of it felt forced. Everything flowed naturally with the story. Some are saying the film is a bit too long. I disagree. I would've sat there for another 2 hours just to see how this story is going to end, and what else they could've done with this art style. My booty would've been sore, but my mind would've been a happy camper! If you do decide to see this, which you 100% should (it may be the best film of the year, but still too early to tell), see it in the IMAX format. It's absolutely breathtaking and you can really see the attention to detail put into the absolutely jaw dropping artwork on display here. Overall, I highly recommend it. Bring the whole family. You'll be enchanted by the story, while the kids will be distracted by the artwork and awesome chase sequences.5 spideys out of 5.","10/10"

I didn't like Juan Guarnizo's voice too much, Pipe Punk's a little bit yes, and I had even read that the youtuber Jugando con Natalia (Juan Manuel Paradiso) had participated in the Latin dubbing, if you can tell me which character he dubbed, I would be very grateful, even being the most attentive, I still can't figure out which character he dubbed his voice to.Besides, I have to admit that I didn't watch ""Into the Spider-Verse"", only several clips, although I still managed to understand the movie and the story.God, when I saw the ending I was left with all the intrigue in the world, and I was like well, let's wait until next year when they release part 2, there's no other way...","6/10"

"nigeldimitrius","17 February 2023","Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 dives deeper into the story of Scott Lang since the climatic events from Avengers 4. Or should I say that it focuses more on the backstory of Janet Van Dyne and her time within the Quantum Realm?...Yeah.. the second thing.Granted, this film shows promise to the rest of Phase 5 by providing us with a valuable first entry. The alien-esque CGI provides us with creative & daunting visuals, especially within our action-packed scenes. However, one of, if not the biggest, takeaway from this movie is Jonathan Majors as He Who Shall Not Be Named. He provides us with sheer talent, unsettling moments, and thought-provoking ideals that keep you at the edge of your seat.The story itself is funny, but lacks high stakes. The way this movie was marketed felt like there was more to lose. However, we're given the same MCU formula that you could point out in another MCU movie. I found myself wanting Majors' character to stay on screen because it felt like he was controlling what I saw next.There isn't much of a clear arc for our returning characters. It feels like we lose sight of where our character's growth starts and ends, leaving their story a bit unclear. The actors do an okay job working against this, but without the high stakes, it almost seems pointless.Overall, Ant-Man & The Wasp 3 is still a decent film and a worthy start to Phase 5. However, with everything we've seen since Phase 4 and even Phase 3, Marvel should consider turning up the heat.","2/10"

A young girl built an engine to become a Hubble satellite in the Quantum world without explanation, that's an empowerment message that went too far and farfetched that ot ruined the beginning. If it was Hank Pimp that built it, it would make more sense.Trying to justify the villains as a regular men forced into doing bad things. Disney has been doing this campaign for a decade and this time, it went disgustingly too much and leaves bad taste.Women lead the packs. As mentioned before, it went overboard and too much.The humors are getting dryer and dryer. With Thor Love & Thunder, Wakanda Forever and Wanda - Vision, Marvel's installments are getting too predictable and leaving a lot of bad taste. A lot of unnecessary stories and lots of money grabbing movies.Feige has not changed his strategy of Marvel's movie development all this time, but his directors and writers are getting worse by every new movie.

It was delightful to revisit some of my favorite scenes, specifically the Guardians of the Galaxy opening (I may be biased because I love the song).Had some really amazing moments. Scott's return to the present and all his interactions. I've always felt Ant-Man doesn't get enough love, and in this one he literally saves the universe (thanks to the rat who turns on the quantum tunnel). Was nice to see Korg and meek return. Professor Hulk as well - now we know why Heimdall saved him first in Infinity War.Time heists - I got goosebumps seeing the familiar sequences from a new perspective. Kind of like behind the scenes. Watching Quill sing Come and get your Love, Jarvis, Howard, aftermath of NY battle, ancient one, events from the dark world. Really amazing.And ofcourse, undoing the snap and the memorable Avengers, Assemble scene were executed perfectly.However, didn't really like two aspects:1) Plot holes. In Infinity War, Thanos with the fully loaded infinity gauntlet couldn't stop Thor's stormbreaker. But the Thanos without the gauntlet, equipped with just a blade manages to overpower not just Thor (with two weapons) AND Cap + Iron Man.

"nincubura","31 August 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is proper movie making, particularly for those of us born before the iPhone, who saw the original in theaters. After the first and third installments, this is the best.Seeing a well plotted and competently directed movie is wonderfully refreshing, after more than a decade of comic book and video game movies. But sadly, this edition of the franchise did not do well at the box office, since it seems that the new generation of moviegoers must be rather A. D. D. And require continuous in-your-face grotesque hyper-stimulation. As in the history classes of Professor Jones, such moviegoers are most likely clueless to what is a Trireme, why it is called that, and what was its significance. Likewise, with the historic significance of the real Antikythera mechanism, let alone Archimedes inception of integral calculus and specific gravity - the most significant mathematical progress after use of the number zero in India, 400 years earlier.There are countless tie-ins and references to the prior editions of the franchise, and the formula is effectuated with excellence. Further, this is based upon a real archeological artifact, which has not been previouisly explored in movie or TV fiction (that I know of) -- and the concept relating back to the first and third movies was absolute genius!Further, this movie omitted most of the absurd stereotyping of characters and cultures in the prior movies. The number of A-list performers was wonderful to see, and their performances did not disappoint.","6/10"
"nincubura","5 February 2024","This appeared to be the usual viligante movie by Jason Stratham, which are usually above average; and which reliably deliver at least somewhat plausible action... Unfortunately, the audio engineering was so poor that the movie was unintelligible -- without a studio quality audio compressor.It seems that the current generation of audio engineers has damaged their hearing with excessively loud music -- to the extent that they have disabled their capacity to effectively engineer audio which properly utilizes the additional dynamic range made available by modern technology.For the rest of you... the objective of greater dynamic range is not to make whspering inaudibly quiet, and explosions make your ears ring. The objective is to expand the range downward, along with the additional reduction of the noise floor. I.e., if you drop the signal to noice ratio from -60dB to -100dB, that allows an increase of dynamic range by 40dB. Specifically, the ability to hear all the audio subtlety and nuance that was previously LOST IN THE NOISE. Instead, contemporary audio engineers merely dispose of that nuance and subtlety, and reduce the speaking level -- to make room for louder explosions.Imagine the same situation for the video presentation, on a screen that could deliver the brightness of the sun (1 Billion NITS). Does that mean the cinematographer should cause the screen to deliver to your eyes, the full level of looking into the sun? (unless of course the objective is to show the sun and make you cover your eyes).Since I couldn't hear Stratham's whistering, under all the overemphasized explosions, gunshots, crashes etc... There really was no point watching the movie after about 22 minutes.An unlistenable movie gets ZERO STARS.SHAME ON AMAZON for creating junk like this, to foster PRIME media dis-service.","1/10"
"ninjaninja-85128","22 July 2023","First off, I see a ton of reviews knocking this movie, giving it a low score mainly for the movie leaving in a cliffhanger... are you serious? Who knew it's a requirement to not leave a movie in a cliffhanger in order for it to be a good movie.I have seen Across the Spiderverse 4 times in theaters. Each time going into the theater I think the movie won't catch my eye like the last watch, and every time I'm wrong. The whole movie is complete eye candy. The animation is incredible, the colors, the art styles. Even from the opening credits... the amount of effort that went into the credits must've been ridiculous.The story has a really nice pace. While having suspenseful and emotional moments in there as well which really hit close to home. The plot was clever with The Spot. Turning from a joke to a serious threat. I loved the music that was used. A lot of the jokes hit. The characters introduced weren't overwhelming, and there were some returning characters which was a nice surprise.I mainly wanted to make this review to say if you rate this movie anything less than an 8 it's just a total insult to everyone who worked on this movie. The animation alone is way better than Into the Spiderverse. Absolutely stunning. There are also plenty of great movies out there that end on cliffhangers, Infinity War being one. This movie is among the greats, regardless of what you may think of the ending.","10/10"
"Nixon_Carmichael","17 February 2023","I don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone involved, I know that nobody sets out to make a bad movie. Yet again though, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is yet another PG13, CGI mud fest.So when we pick up, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is walking down the streets of San Francisco underneath the theme song from Welcome Back, Kotter....After a quick voiceover the characters are inexplicably flung into the throes of a Star Wars, CGI, acid trip. Even though some of the visuals are interesting, this movie has no discernible plot. It is literally just one, big CGI mud fest after another. If you told me that this movie was written by a third grade boy on a sugar, I wouldn't fall out of my chair in the shock.The true crime here is that for months on end, Marvel have touted Quantumania as ""An Avengers Level Event"", which was clearly a blatant lie. At the end of the film, nothing has taken place.It's a crying shame.","5/10"
"njasis","18 January 2019","I loved the animation and action in this movie. The characters are fleshed out enough for those who have seen Dragon Ball before, and if you haven't seen Dragon Ball you can still enjoy the movie. The main characters are likeable, and the villain is also quite interesting. There are good guys and there are bad guys, but also someone in between, which makes it all so much more interesting to watch. The fights are awesome, with spectacular animation though of course it can always be better. The artstyle resembles the original series, and the music has some nice tunes here and there that builds up the tense moments. This is one of the things that the movie should have more of - tense moments. Since it""s only 1 hour 30 minutes long the movie feels kinda rushed and thus lacks some dragged out scenes that could have made the moments even more epic. Even the story feels a bit rushed though they did a really good job to explain Brolys background. And who knows, there might be a second movie some day. All in all the positives outshines the rest which makes the movie a great one to watch. A must see for action and anime fans.","7/10"
"nmik2005","25 January 2019","Broly has been one of the best character's that has come out of the Dragonball movie canon's and fans have been hoping that he'd be actually part of the canon and finally this has happened. This movie not only adds a lot more depth to Broly's character than any of the other movies but also adds a lot more backstory to Dragon ball mythos. I am not sure how I feel about the change that was made to Bardock's story but I guess the Bardock special was never an official canon according to the makers, so maybe that's ok.So back to the movie, wow. The fights are so exhilarating and is way better than any of the fights ever show in the anime. The animation was top notch, the only complaint would be some of silly humor which could be a hit or miss at times and the mediocre sound track. The fights definitely made up for the average sound track.In conclusion, Dragonball Super Broly is definitely a must watch for any fans of the franchise.","10/10"
"nmn34","20 January 2019","I cannot stress this enough, this is not a good introduction into the Dragonball series. If you have not watched the series, do not watch this movie. It will simply make no sense and you will get absolutely nothing out of it. Now that out of the way, this is definitely one of the best Dragonball movies, if not the best.To really see what the movie does well, its important to understand what its predecessors do wrong. They treat the movie like its own story arch, with a big bad and his minions scheming for the dragonballs, tree of life, a can of Coke or whatever, and its up to the heroes to come together and curb stomp them all in short, unimpressive fights. After laying out Toriyama's shopping list disguised as antagonists, the big bad readies to fight them to close out the last ten minutes and gets eliminated by some sort of plot device like Gohan's dormant power, a Hail Mary energy blast, or whistling. There is little catharsis and the villains are tossed in the trash never to be heard from again. Except for Broly. The hulking behemoth gets center stage in this movie, after exploring his character he is thrown headlong into a brutal slobber knocker that carries the movie further than any cockamamie scheme and cannon fodder ever could. The fight itself is masterfully paced, Broly has been fighting for training wheels all his life and finally meeting someone that can match him he just keeps improving until he can match the overpowered heroes. As they escalate, so does he until he becomes an unstoppable monster devoid of reason and mercy. It in itself tells an interesting story that can't be expressed in words. Finally, Broly is the main event threat that he is designed to be.This leads us back to another massive improvement, in spite of the popularity of the character, Broly's prior appearances aren't good. In fact, the chatracter's backstory has been downright stupid. In his first outing, his personal driving force was his disdain for baby Goku's crying when they were in the nursery. Its a postnatal grudge match, as ridiculous as that sounds. Sure there is the grudge his father has for Vegeta and the Saiyan race but most of it is Goku's crying. This is followed up with his clone Bio-Broly who melts pretty much instantly and can't even speak. To fix the character with one of the worst backstories the movies had ever contrived, they focused on what worked. Broly has never interacted with any of the main cast, he hasn't interacted with anyone but his father since before the series starts. Stranded together, the two have done nothing but refine him into a killing machine to reek revenge upon the Saiyan race that scorned them. He was a monster made, living a childhood devoid of kindness or care, the only creature he can endear himself to is a massive carnivorous beast and even that is taken from him by his tyrannical father. When he is found and brought before Frieza, he is seen as an impressive tool to avenge his defeat at the hands of Goku but proves too powerful for the alien tyrant to control. There is nothing superfluous about him, he is a force of nature that threatens the earth.With such a direct plot, its the fight that everyone paid to see and it gives everything in spades. The animation is crisp as it transitions into CGI and everything has a good sense of weight. Goku getting slammed alas Loki in the Avengers doesn't look like he is made of feathers, Broly slings him around like a bag of hammers while the heroes body goes ragdoll. There are plenty of zippy movements that lead into a very visually appealing scene where they break time and space with their fighting only to smash their way back. They even manage to work in some funny comedy as Goku and Vegeta rope Frieza into the fight. The only real complaint is how the initial fight with Vegeta ends, Goku simply steps in and Vegeta doesn't complain. It lacks any decisive winner and transitions poorly.Again, if you are a fan of the series this is a must see, but if not know that it does not explain anything. If anything I said doesn't make sense its only a fraction of the show specific terms that they will not define. There are flashbacks to scenes from the series that well have no context for those who have not seen them and characters who get no introduction at all. This is specifically for the fans","10/10"

"No-Life-101","10 August 2023","I finally got around to watching Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse and I'm so happy that I did, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and know I'll be rewatching it soon. I managed to avoid spoilers for this movie and I'm so happy that I did because I went in not knowing anything besides information from the previous movie. This movie starts by giving us Gwen's backstory which I found heartbreaking, the visuals were strong and the music added to the story and then from there we go back to Miles which the story focuses on. I like the subtle detail of the music changing depending on what dimension they're in and who's involved, I also loved the themes being incorporated into the music too.The character introductions were amazing, funny, and unique to every spider person, I love how they animated everyone differently depending on what dimension they came from to show that difference. Also, their designs! I'm in love with them all, they're so detailed, it almost leaves me speechless. As well as I love how everyone interacts with their environment, they see things from unique perspectives and move in such bouncy ways that it looks natural for anybody to do, but I know that if I tried to move the way they did I'd pull something. But this detail especially shows during action scenes, they make the world seem bigger, and they make the fights engaging and fun to watch.Storywise, I loved the comedy and found myself laughing at the jokes and how the characters interacted. I loved the natural mix of different languages and when the characters were speaking in their native language I felt like that was just between characters and not really for the audience to understand what's being said but how it's being said. Also, the visual details of character growth since the previous movie, Miles grew, Gwen grew and her hair got longer, it makes it seem like just because we don't see the characters their lives are still ongoing. I also loved the connection between Miles and the villain, it calls back to the previous movie.Overall, this movie is not only visually appealing but emotional too. The music is powerful, and the story is engaging and at times funny too. I did not see that plot twist ending though, but it makes me excited to see another movie!","10/10"
"noah_eye","13 November 2012","I was lucky enough to see Pi in full 3D Imax at a pre-viewing in San Diego last night, and as a huge fan of the book, I was intensely satisfied.Believe it or not, I was more impressed with the the casting choices and performances of the players than by the effects. Granted, the movie was very beautiful, but in the end, Life Of Pi was more character driven than anything. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add, as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis, the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story. I would recommend seeing Pi in 3D, but I don't think that's it's essential to your viewing enjoyment. The 3D just takes a beautiful film and makes it a little bit nicer. Also, if you've read the book and are concerned that the story you loved may have been compromised in anyway, worry no longer. This is easily, one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.Happy viewing folks. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. I'll be seeing it again in theaters very soon.","10/10"
"noahbmayfield","17 February 2023","Don't get me wrong, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" started out very strong. Lately, Marvel has had a tendency to rush through their movies without any room for viewers to breathe, but I can honestly say that this one refreshingly differed from that trend. Everything that had to do with exposition was enticing, to say the least. I really thought Marvel was finally going to get back on track with reviews.However, by the time the final battle ended, I just felt confused. There were so many incredible moments in the movie. The characters were great and the set up of Kang and the future of the MCU was flawless. So why did I feel so... empty when it was over?It's really quite simple: there was no plot. For a movie with so much going on, there really wasn't much going on.As a set up for what's to come, it was well done and enjoyable. But judging it on it's own, as a single movie, it just wasn't made with a story in mind. As an avid fan of the Ant-Man films, and a constant to defender of 2018's ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" I'm disappointed. There were so many interesting ideas that Peyton Reed could have used for a great story, but instead, we got a ball of excellent moments with nothing to tie them together.It's not bad... But it isn't exactly f-ANT-astic either.","6/10"
"Nobody-27","8 April 2014","Life of Pi is a story about a teen who gets stranded in the middle of the ocean with a few wild animals... most notably a tiger.If the setup sounds interesting to you, than you would probably like the film as that's all there is to it. That and some decent visual effects and nice photography.As for the story - there is not much there. It starts with ""The story will make you believe in God"" or something to that effect, but there is no place for God in it. Some claim it is meant to prove non-existence of God... but I did not see it that way. It is too blah to have anything in it really.Bottom line: in the world where true mysticism and symbolism is lost, there is no shortage of pretentious works of ""art"" (film, novels, or anything else) which gladly promises to bring some new value. They all have a few things in common:Story originates in a far away land and/or timeIt is based on some completely unimportant and ridiculous premise that only young teenagers may be interested in itIt is visually richWhether it is Life of PI or any other similarly dumb fantasy such as Harry Potter or Lord Of The Ring, it does not really matter. They all require that the consumer have low expectations, poor understanding of human condition, and is easily entertained with anything that seems even a little ""different"".Often, forced attempts to be different brings us just more of the same, and Life Of PI does just that.","9/10"
"nodlimax","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though.","6/10"
"nogodnomasters","24 July 2018","The film opens with a lengthy character build-up of Pi. It starts off with the crude explanation on how he got his name. It contrasts this with Pi's discovery of religion to the point of believing in universalism. His lofty ideas are quickly contrasted with a dose of reality when a tiger, he thinks he has connected with, eats a live goat. After he develops a love interest we finally come to the meat of the tale.His family opts to go to Canada on a Japanese merchant ship and if everything went okay, you wouldn't see a picture of Pi in a boat with said tiger promoting this film. His life's experience are reflected in his relationship with the tiger and survival at sea.Pi's life is one filled with contrasts. He is a microcosm of India and perhaps the world as his name is symbolic of the constant the defines circles, orbs, and globes. That is the spiritual aspect. However his name derives from the ""P"" word giving it a dose of crude reality. The film/book is designed to be a metaphor. This is demonstrated in the end when Pi gives us two stories, then asks, ""Which do you prefer?"" as a way to test one's views in a world of contrasts.While the film is interesting on a number of levels, it is heavily narrated with an accent. This caused me to occasionally miss a word every now and then. Hopefully the DVD will have English subtitles.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. While rated PG I thought Pi dropped the F-bomb near the end when he was talking about the two Japanese investigators. It was tough to tell with the accent. Beginning of film frequently refers to pi**ing.","10/10"

Brie Larson was in the film far less than expected. When you have so many Avengers on the screen at one time, it is hard for anyone to get a major part.After they did the Blues Brothers, we are getting the band back routine, they did a very awkward ""Back to the Future"" movie that did not work as well as planned. I expected Nebula would trick Thanos and get some stones followed by the mother of all battles led by Captain Marvel. They didn't make that film.The production had some good laugh lines and some hold back the tears moments. Not to give away too much, but it was rumored some stars didn't want to do the series anymore. They were given a Captain Kirk exit.And yes, there is, of course, the mother of all Avenger's battle which will be hard to top.Stan Lee as a driver.","7/10"

Scott picks his daughter up from jail as the entire family has dinner.

The issue is the bad guy Kang (Jonathan Majors) who can see the future and wants to destroy universes and time lines.The film often reminded me of ""Star Wars."" They had an ooze that worked like Douglas Adams' babble fish but without the fun commentary. There is a Ewok looking guy and a scene inspired by ""Them!""

"nogodnomasters","30 July 2017","Minor mid plot explanation.The movie opens with a few written lines to recap the last film.The war consists of 5 different sides, similar to Syria with no real solution.

There is a third group of humans who don't want to kill the mutes, so they want to kill Woody's group. They don't like apes either.Woody Harrelson plays a serious role without his usual humor. There is plenty of homage paid to the original film which I loved, especially in the selection of names, ""Nova"" being the most obvious. The X frames on which apes were hung and the marching army reminded me of the original film. Steve Zahn as ""Bad Ape"" reminded my of Golem....sorry guys wrong film.

The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver.

"nolandalla-447-695930","28 November 2012","Life of Pi is a difficult movie to review.Certain to be one of the year's most widely-discussed films, in part because it's open to multiple interpretations, this is a bold cinematic achievement by Oscar-winning director Ang Lee.Yet, it's also fundamentally flawed, its most puzzling script gaps camouflaged by extraordinary special effects and first-rate performances by the actors who portray the lead character at different stages of his life. Indeed, the varied imagery and wide range of emotional demands upon the actors are so compelling that one might actually overlook the glaring contradiction within the film's most intriguing question — which deals with the storyteller's relationship with God. The film is such a powerful visual spectacle that the audience deserves an equally consistent storyline — and ultimately just as satisfying a payoff — which compliments the arduous endurance test of sitting through what feels like an overly-long 2 hour and 20 minute epic journey across the world's biggest ocean.First, the basics. ""Pi"" is an Indian boy who enjoys an almost idyllic childhood. His early years are spent in a tropical seaside paradise located on the coast of the Indian Ocean. Pi's family owns and operates a zoo with several exotic animals.When Pi becomes a teenager, his father decides to disband the zoo and move the entire family abroad. This leads to a life-changing adventure. To its credit, the story challenges many conventional assumptions about new immigrants. We assume immigrants are thrilled to be in a new homeland. But that's not always the case. After all, what child wants to be uprooted from a house near the beach, living happily among zoo animals — as is the case with Pi? I found this to be a powerful message — no doubt experienced by many very real immigrant children — which I had frankly never considered before. Sometimes, immigrants leave happy lives behind when forced to move elsewhere due to circumstances beyond their control.The family and their prized zoo animals set off to Canada, which is to become their new home. Pi and his family board a cargo ship scheduled to cross the Pacific Ocean, with several wild animals from what had been the family zoo boarded in steerage.A deadly typhoon changes everything. During the storm, Pi is thrown into an open lifeboat and is ultimately forced to survive on his own at sea. To make matters worse, but undoubtedly more interesting for the audience, some wild animals manage to find sanctuary inside the lifeboat with the terrified Pi. One of the animals that climbs aboard is a vicious Bengal tiger.The story is entirely plausible up to this point. In the interest of avoiding spoilers for those who have not seen the movie, let's just say Pi and his beastly companion end up spending many months at sea together locked in a battle for supremacy and survival. As one can imagine, the demands which would be extraordinary were Pi sailing solo are magnified tenfold by the presence of a wild beast that views everything on the boat as his next tasty meal.One thing which can be revealed is that Pi somehow manages to survive the ordeal. The story is told in flashbacks by an older and wiser Pi, ostensibly living somewhere in Canada in the present day. These segments introduce the film's most puzzling assertion.The movie includes strong religious overtones throughout. Pi's early years are spent searching for God and the right religion to join. This is a pervasive theme throughout all stages of the film — setting up the central character's most poignant moment of self-discovery. This takes place when the adult Pi, now in his early 40s, reveals to the listener that the perilous sea voyage enabled him to better know and understand God. The reflection is largely positive.Alas, Pi spends considerable time praising God as his savior at sea. After all, the necessities for survival were ultimately provided to him.And therein lies the glaring contradiction. Pi reveres the same God who essentially murdered his entire family, needlessly sent dozens of innocent animals off to a torturous and terrifying death, and transformed him into an orphan in a strange land — not to mention having to endure a terrorizing ordeal on the high seas for 227 days. If God is to be praised for providing precious food and water at opportune moments while exposed at sea for months on end, shouldn't the same divinity also bear the blame for causing so much death and misery in the first place? ""Gee God — thanks for the tuna and rainwater. I guess that's payback for drowning my giraffe, two elephants, plus my mom and dad."" Moreover, the beautiful imagery becomes something of a distraction. Several short interludes interrupt Pi's struggle at sea, which show off a kaleidoscope of splendor. Unfortunately, these scenes in no way serve to advance the story nor answer any of the fundamental questions and judgments which Pi is entitled to make following his experience.Life of Pi is not a film for children. It's being promoted as an action-adventure with a boy as the star, and various animals as the supporting cast. But these are not Disney animals. They are wild beasts capable of killing in an instant. There are several scenes of savagery, which left may children screaming and crying in the showing I attended. For those expecting to see Beauty and the Beast at sea, think again.In summation, this is a spectacular cinematic achievement, which will undoubtedly be rewarded at Oscar time. Deservedly so.Everyone will take away something different away from this movie. My interpretation is that life — even when filled with the prospect of danger and death — can be mesmerizing, even beautiful. However, as a spiritual awakening, this is a movie which cannot be rescued. That message remains aimlessly adrift at sea.www.nolandalla.com","10/10"

"noloxtreme","16 July 2017","The first movie of the year to me that did not live up to the high expectations set by the first two. Dawn of the planet of the apes is still to me the best of the series.As others have also stated, this was not really a ""War"" for the planet. Which is a bit weird, seeing as we've already an impressive battle between humans and apes in Dawn. I was expecting more of that, but on a more epic scale-the final showdown for the planet. On one side, Woody Harrelson's character-a multi layered character. Humanity's greatest and last hope, making one final stand. And on another, Caesar-leading his species in their final fight against humanity for dominance of the planet. I was expecting epic, complex military strategies and battles. But alas, all we got was Caesar's personal quest for revenge and an ape concentration camp. Hell, that would be fine if the apes didn't have to then depend on Deus ex machina, stupidity and coincidence to escape the camp.I honestly don't know what the director was going for with this movie. The title certainly doesn't fit the movie. This movie did not really move the plot forward, other than to try to tie in the original movie where humans could no longer speak. But you can't make an entire movie just on that premise. Anyways. It's a solid trilogy but the last part is the weakest of the series. I just wanted to see Caesar, emulate his namesake Julius Caesar and lead the Apes in battle. We didn't get that.","10/10"
"NormanCroucher","9 October 2017","The new 'Planet of the Apes' franchise has been an unexpected and surprising success, easily equaling the quality of its iconic ancestral lineage, or even arguably surpassing it. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' was always going to be a tough act to follow but thankfully 'War' bucks the trilogy trend of the third film often being a lesser installment. It's not as well executed or as well structured as 'Dawn', but it's an excellent film nonetheless and builds upon an already rich mythology that offers up an elaborate explanation as to how Charlton Heston came back from space to find himself on a damn monkey planet.Matt Reeves returns for directing duties and recaptures the same foreboding and tension he evoked the last time around. This is a very downbeat and bleak movie, so much so I actually had to remind myself that this is a summer blockbuster produced and released by 20th Century Fox. It's incredible to think that something as dark as this can still sneak under the wire and into the mainstream, and we should all be thankful of that fact. Andy Serkis has graduated across the series from being the plot device of 'Rise', to the dual protagonist of 'Dawn', to the full-on lead character of 'War', and his motion captured performance is truly remarkable. You can even tell it's his face at certain points - a sneer here, a frown there - and I fully believe this performance should qualify him for an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor. He's the crown jewel of this franchise and he leads the charge from beginning to end this time around. I also have to make room for Steve Zahn's performance as a newly introduced ape, who is about the closest thing to a comic relief this film gets and his comic timing and tender eccentricity allows some breathing room between all the doom and gloom. The crowning achievement of this trilogy is its ability to seamlessly blend technological craft with human artistry. I have always favoured practical effects over CGI, but my god, even I can't deny just how magnificent the visual effects are. This is as close to photo- real you will see.The title of the film is somewhat of a mislead since it's a much smaller and more intimate story this time around, and I feel there was more of an epic war taking place in 'Dawn'. This is much more of a revenge tale, framed through the eyes of our protagonist Caesar, who we have seen grow up and mature into a leader across the two previous films, which lends a greater sense of dimension and complexity to his character. Watching him and his clan strike back against the remnants of the human race becomes an interesting exercise for us. As human beings we are naturally predisposed to the survival of our species, even in fiction, and usually films set in a post-apocalyptic world tend to lean heavily towards that as the goal. The 'Apes' films ask us to do something else - they ask us to root AGAINST the human race, and that does create a conflict within us as viewers. Not all humans are bad, and we know where this story is taking us once you factor in 'Planet of the Apes' 1968, yet at the same time these apes are every bit as complex and fallible and heroic and dangerous as we are. They have an equal right to live and build a future together. And while this film definitely comes down on the side of the apes, unlike 'Dawn' which showed the failings of both sides to make peace, it is a strange experience rooting for them to win this time around since there are no real human allies like James Franco or Jason Clarke's characters. In any other film, the apes would be the villains and Woody Harrelson's Colonel character makes a good case as to why he sees it that way, even though the filmmakers jettison his humanity in order to paint him as a more out-and-out villain. After all, we, the audience, have to be on side come the finale, especially come the arrival of an unexpected deus ex machina.This has been an intelligent and emotionally and morally complex series of films that have raised interesting questions about animal rights, speciesism, societal hierarchies, leadership and subservience, communication, conflict and peace. They are not simply mindless sci- fi movies cashing in on an existing property. Both of the previous films have been deeply thoughtful explorations of those aforementioned themes and ideas. So I am very pleased to report that 'War for the Planet of the Apes' proudly carries that torch all the way through to its beautifully biblical final moments.","9/10"
"normanemailer","18 September 2023","Having seen all the Indiana Jones movies, I was surprised that the studios decided on one more outing. Even more so that Harrison Ford would accept playing the rôle once more. CGI is there to de-age him for the first part of the film and then we see what an 81 year old body looks like on a semi-naked man who's prepared himself with diet and exercise.What Waller Bridge contributed to the writing and acting was unwanted. She has no charisma on the big screen and being signed by a desperate Hollywood to help write a script that was weak and had plot holes from the opening.This was flat, lacked tension, a lot of tell instead of show. Should never have been made.","7/10"
"NorthFalcon55","8 February 2024","What a total swing and a miss. They had an AMAZING premise that could have been sooooooo much more satisfying. I mean who doesn't want scam call centers to suffer consequences of destroying innocent people who don't know what's actually going to happen to them.Pros: some of the fight scenes were cool. SOMECons: literally everything else including most of the action scenes.1. The idea to go after Clay instead of THE ACTUAL CORRUPT COMPANY THAT THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO GO AFTER FOR A WHILE MADE NO SENSE. Law enforcement had a hard time tracking down the Danforth company and Clay found them immediately. Why go after HIM? Oh it's because he's going after them as a vigilante, ohhhhh nooooooo that's not okay but the company responsible for one of the main character's mothers suicide gets away with it since they want to go after Clay. The company is being run by a 28 year old when it would make so much more sense to make him older.2. Agent Verona Parker. Oh what an awful character. Her mother committed suicide after falling victim to this company and yet she wants to follow her little ""oath"". Yup makes sense. Go after the man who cared for her mom. Loved her mom. Wants to avenge her death. Yeah let's go after that guy since he's not doing in ""correctly"". Emmy Raver-Lampman did a great job and they did her so wrong. She's very talented but they wasted her talent on a bozo of a character.3. Danforth's mom turned out to be the president. OHHHHH WOOOOW WHAT A PLOT TWIST(sarcasm). The only good twist was that he funded her campaign with dirty money. That was actually a great twist. That caught me off guard. The kid kills the deputy director for no good reason and then attempts to kill his mom. So stupid.4. The ending: finally after all this time, Parker has the opportunity to take down Clay but lets him go. All that chaos for nothing.A huge fail. Amazing job by the actors but they were done wrong by the stupid writing and direction of the film.","1/10"
"noshouse","1 September 2023","As always, ""the Dial of Destiny"" kicks off with a quest to snatch a certain treasure. Although having watched the trailer and behind-the-scenes footage, besides admiring the impressive CGI, I must admit that it's this opening segment that forms a time-linked connection for me. As a long-time ""Indiana Jones"" fan, it's heartwarming to see my childhood and adolescent hero still embodying the same spirit, even as Harrison Ford has aged. It feels like witnessing Michael Jordan sprinting on the basketball court when I'm fifty. Returning to ""the Dial of Destiny,"" I appreciate how the screenwriter used modern scientific research to highlight the uniqueness of ""the Dial of Destiny"" in this installment. It's a treat for both mystery enthusiasts and curious minds who enjoy scientific reasoning. Without comparing it to the earlier series, it's definitely worth enjoying these two hours in the cinema.","6/10"
"noshouse","16 September 2023","Actually, this whole movie kind of ruined the sci-fi research spirit I saw in the previous installments. Maybe it's because Ant-Man's unique power is all about shrinking and not losing strength when doing so. The coolest thing they utilize is probably the quantum suits. But this exceptional and awesome weapon might have run out of freshness, which led to the film focusing more on replicating various human dilemmas in the so-called quantum world. Then it's a repeat of the conflicts caused by the seven emotions and six desires. Haha, I didn't find it very refreshing, but Stoll's MODOK did have its funny moments.","1/10"

Every line of dialogue, story beat, voice actor, are all perfect. Metro Boomin's songs and Daniel Pemberton's score are perfect. I love every second of this movie. It hit me hard man. This is my Empire Strikes back, my Infinity War. Planning on seeing it again multiple times. See it on the best screen possible. I love Miles and Gwen's relationship.

"notifynow","11 February 2024","Statham is consistently the badass and here it's no different but in this movie there is a depth to the characterization seldom seen in action movies. There are some comedic moments that are so unexpected they just slay here. Not many but where they are they're so effective and break up the tension in remarkable ways. The directing is really what sets this movie apart as the camera work is meticulous and you feel so ""right there"". The only detraction was Statham's seeming invincibility to highly trained combat trained specialists, often several against one. But this is typical for action movies so we can give that a pass. I only wish there was more time with Jeremy Irons. Hard to believe an actor of such stature would be involved in an action movie but he played his part at 110% as always.You know there are going to be sequels. Statham has a real winner here. The storyline is rather unique for action movies and is a definite keeper. You can bank on it. I just hope they go for a more realistic character because they can't get away with the invincible star and stay within the confines of reality again. Let's hope. This has so much promise.The profanity was unending and really detracted from the storyline as it was so unneeded and diluted the strength of the dialogue as it always does when writers seem to run out of words. Hopefully they'll hire a better writer in the future.","7/10"

"npfares","29 June 2019","The idea of the film is there. What killed the movie overall was the writing and the poor choices made by the director. I get that they wanted to pander to the younger kids that were 12 or younger but went to ridiculous lengths to do so that killed any reason for anyone over the age of 30 to like it beyond being happy that their children liked it.","10/10"
"npfares","6 July 2018","I know a lot of you trolls out there are not going to like this review but whatever. 1. To big of a cast. Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie. In the end, this movie was the 'might have been' movie. Too many 13 year olds went to see this movie who have never went to see movies before this.","10/10"
"NpMoviez","8 May 2019","After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.Rating.Score : 8.9/10Grade : A","9/10"
"npvarley","1 February 2024","This a fairly generic action flick with a decent cast. It's quite well shot, the action scenes are well choreographed and there's a satisfyingly unlikable baddie.Statham always put in entertaining performances and he's got a cheeky chappy approach to most of his roles that always keeps it witty. Like he knows that we know that he's having a great time. He doesn't take himself too seriously and knows exactly what he's good at.The supporting cast do a decent job and the movie reaches a satisfying conclusion. I daresay a Beekeeper sequel would be pretty entertaining, too!Worth a couple of hours of your time!","7/10"
"nqmedia","31 July 2023","This is my favorite animated film of the year and was better than I was expecting (as I'm over the whole multiverse storyline in films). It took a horrible comic villain and made it into a formidable foe; it took one of my favorite Spider-Mans (Spider-Man 2099) and made him into a formidable and flawed hero/villain, and it crafted and amazing story for both leads, while also ending the story in Part 1 while setting up another spin-off story for Part 2. I also loved the mix of animation styles as it made sense to the story (and wasn't just a gimmick) and the music score was perfect! One of the best films of '23 in my opinion.","10/10"
"nrbarton","28 February 2013","I went to see 'Life Of Pi' in 3D as I'd heard what an amazing, life-changing movie it was, and that it was one of the best uses of 3D ever. Unfortunately it was neither of these things. Theoretically, it's a movie which few people should actually like, and should offend religious people, yet almost everyone seems to be lapping it up like God's very own ejaculate.I'll get the 3D aspect out of the way first. Whilst the visuals were brilliant, beautiful and sometimes breathtaking with vibrant fluorescent colours, there wasn't a single shot of 3D in the entire film that made me think, 'that's impressive use of 3D', and I'm a fan of good 3D. Whilst Pi was poking a stick at the screen, instead of it coming out at me in 3D, it was a rather pathetic, unfocused blur.The film is about a boy/young man called Pi who was shipwrecked. A writer tracks him down as he hears Pi has a wonderful story that will supposedly make him believe in God. Pi tells the story and it's incredibly long-winded with nothing remotely miraculous in it, mostly just a load of bad luck. Most of the story is Pi and a tiger stuck on a small rescue boat, and whilst that's interesting for a while, after about an hour, it becomes really rather tedious.Pi then tells a second story which is the true version of events, and there's nothing remotely miraculous in that one either, again just a load of bad luck. At this point I was thinking 'I cannot believe I've spent about an hour watching Pi and a tiger on a boat when it never even happened and he was just bulls**tting us'.So basically he tells two stories, one of which is lies and one true. He then asks the writer which story he prefers and he says he, ""The one with the tiger. That's the better story."" Pi responds, ""Thank you. And so it goes with God."" However, just because the writer preferred the first story doesn't mean he now believes in God like Pi claimed he would; he merely liked the first story better. Just like Pi's first story, this claim is more bulls**t from a compulsive liar. Personally, I liked the second story much better, which was never even shown, merely given a brief spoken account of. It sounded like it would have made a far better movie than an hour on a boat befriending a tiger. What Pi should have said is that the two stories he was about to tell would make the writer understand the nature of faith better, not make him believe in God.The message,which began with Pi as a kid following three different religions, and ended with him spelling out that that it doesn't matter which story(religion/belief) is true, just follow the one you like the best and comforts you the most, is a terrible message. It teaches people that it's OK to believe in lies instead of the truth, to follow a religion just because it has a nice story, and maybe even follow a few simultaneously then you can enjoy all the various stories.The movie tries to have an open-minded, positive message about religion, encompassing them all. That's all very well for teaching tolerance of other religions, but as a message it's problematic as I just find it so flaky. Since when has the truth been so unimportant? The truth is important and I won't let this ill-thought-out movie tell me otherwise. As someone who doesn't agree with the concept of believing in lies just to comfort oneself with a nice story, the message went against what I believe.Furthermore, I don't understand how anyone religious could like the movie either. Surely the whole point of religion is to follow it because you actually believe it to be the truth, not just because it's comforting and a nice story. If I was religious then I would find this message patronising and offensive. Religious people praising the movie can only mean one of two things: 1) They're fully aware that their religion is a lie and don't care as they're happy just liking the story 2) They didn't get the message of the film. Neither of these reasons are anything to be proud of.The only demographic I would imagine liking this film are flaky people, and people who think being flaky is acceptable, or even admirable. According to IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, this is over 80% of the population. I can't say I find THAT true story very comforting, but, as the truth is apparently not important, maybe I should believe that nobody is flaky and everyone else agrees with me and sees 'Life Of Pi' for what it really is. If there's one thing I can't stand it's flakiness; it's annoying and you never know where you stand with such people or what they stand for.I liked the idea of a story being too traumatic to tell so giving a false version with symbolism instead, but the message about religion was stupid. If people simply enjoyed the journey then that's fine but it isn't that interesting, and without the message, hollow. People thinking the message is wonderfully deep, beautiful and philosophical, however, need to quit being such flakes and give themselves a slap. Yann Martel, who wrote this 'lying-is-wonderful' story, needs to find another career and spare the world from more stupid messages.Other than impressive and beautiful visuals, a few lines of good humour and a shipwreck, this film had nothing for me. Plus it dragged, like Ang Lee movies tend to; I would honestly have preferred to sit through his 'Hulk' movie a second time. Pi is a boring, time-wasting, flaky, bulls**tting douche, and I'd be grateful if next time he kept his ill-thought-out, tediously long-winded stories to himself.","10/10"

Does an amazing job at doing right by it's characters, answering questions, being emotional and vulnerable, and also acts as a dazzling display of effects and choreography.I'm not sure they truly make movies like this anymore; epic, raw, thought-provoking storytelling within a world of CGI and action.

"nscoby93","16 January 2024","This will be quick... everything about this film is hilariously bad. The script is bad, the writing is bad, and the dialogue is bad. It was so bad that I couldn't help but feel it was parody of itself because of how serious they took this subject matter.The premise is so laughable in its stupidity. If it wasn't for Statham and the surprisingly amazing action sequences, choreography, and great sound effects, this film would've been a complete waste of time.Jason Statham plays the Beekeeper who is essentially Jason Bourne, John Wick, and Agent 47 levels of badass. Jason Statham, to his credit, makes this whole Beekeeper ""society"" work as he is a sort of agent outside the government that protects society. He is retired now but is forced out to write a wrong against someone who cared for him. At it's core this film is nothing more than a paint by numbers action revenge movie. Unfortunately, it does it all in the most horrendous of ways.Then, if the story wasn't already horrible enough, the ending left my friend and I laughing. It literally, and I am not exaggerating here, just ends the cut to credits is the most erupt ending I've seen in a movie. If this ending is supposed to be set up to a possible sequel, I say NO!This year is not starting so well, but it is only January. This is commonly the slow time when it comes to movie releases. So if you are desperate enough and I mean desperate then maybe you can garner some entertainment from The Beekeeper but expect nothing from the story or characters turn your brain off enjoy your popcorn, your beverage, and good action.IMDb: 3/10

"nscoby93","19 February 2023","With every new Marvel release seems to come with it a new reason to question if Marvel even knows what they're doing anymore.Ten plus years of good Marvel movies, since the opening of the MCU with Iron Man in 2008 we have been gifted with great entertainment, good writing, and great characters, played by great actors. Now... and now... just look at yourself Marvel, what have you become?I genuinely still want to believe Marvel can return to what made Phases 1 through 3 so good but every new film just kills that hope a little everytime.Now Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, this film is the definition of a mixed bag. I wanted this movie to be good and I wanted to love it and I definitely wanted all the low scores and bad reviews to be wrong this is just not the case.So what is wrong with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania? Well short answer everything. From poor writing, to cringe dialogue, terrible cgi (which seems to be Marvel's forte now) to absolute piss poor pacing, terrible structure, and no coherent thought anywhere and that's just the first hour of the film.However this atrocity is somewhat saved all thanks to Kang The Conqueror who is played magnificently by Johnathan Majors. For the first time in this entire mess of Phase 4 or now 5 whatever the hell Phase this is, we are treated to a truly menacing, terrifying, ruthless villain who can rival Thanos. He is a true threat and the best villain since Thanos but unfortunately even he is lead to a letdown by the end. Which is the second biggest problem with this film, at soo many moments this film can be better than what it is but the writer is complicit to just keep writing trash! Trash jokes, trash lines, trash everything!The entire first hour of this film is like watching a headless chicken running around, there is no structure as we jump from scene to scene with some of the worst background cgi. If it had nothing to do with Kang I did not care. He literally carried this film on his back.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as I said with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is why writing for a TV show and a major motion picture are two very different things. Why would you hire a writer who has only done some TV stuff and some episodes of Rick and Morty?But the biggest problem from this film is that it suffers a identity crisis, trying soo hard to do soo much and to be soo many different things. Trying to make the Quantum world beautiful and equal to Avatar's Pandora, a story and Sci-Fi epic equal to that of Star Wars, and somewhere trying to be a Marvel film all at the same time.I just keep asking what's the problem Marvel/Disney, is it money? Well that can't be it because you threw 200 million dollars at this. Do you simply not care anymore? Or maybe you keep hiring writers who DO NOT care about these characters and where they come from. I've read very little of the Marvel comics in my life and I have more respect for the source material than these writers seem to have.Anyway, I'm just disappointed and rather heartbroken at how Ant-Man is treated here. You were one of my last hopes Ant-Man and now it seems its all up to James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps they can become the Guardians of the MCU we will see.Ant-Man you had a good run but you have unfortunately gone the way of Love and Thunder and Multiverse of Madness. He was the smallest hero but was also the biggest... literally biggest because he could grow to like 80 something feet, you at least had two good movies.IMDb: 3/10

"nscoby93","22 November 2022","The Russo brothers took what was seemingly a impossible task of not only meeting expectations but of wrapping up a storyline 11 years in the making and they knocked it out of the park.To take all these characters, their storylines, their archs, and bring it all together to fit in one single film and for everyone to have their moments is what I can only imagine to be an extremely difficult task yet the cast and crew made it look easy. While I would've wished for more screen time from certain characters ie Ronan it was still well done.Now there's obviously no such thing as the perfect film but this comes damn close. An amazing cast, fantastic visuals, phenomenal score by Alan Silvestri, and something Marvel lacks today good writing.This was the film of a generation and the theater going experience of a lifetime, I would just like to say thank you to the Russo brothers and the entirety of the cast and crew for the hard work and passion that went into the making of this phenomenal film...

Plot was terrible and should've been used for another character that isn't AntMan. AntMans character isn't designed for anything heavily intertwined with plot, and he especially isn't someone to use when introducing MCU's new Villain. This movie seems like they just wanted to get AntMans movie out of the way because they had no idea what to do with him.There's no issues with the casting, however, the new writing makes it seem like they're taking two toys from opposing companies and trying to make it work.They also need to bring back Michael Peña - he stole both of the two movies .","6/10"
"numenorsniper-66396","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way.

The majority of millennials, kids and fanboys will go crazy with all the visual effects and the chaos that hides the numerous frames filled with poorly drawn characters and extremely ugly animations, just like many gaming studios do with graphics effects to hide visual flaws. You doubt? Just watch the fight in slow motion, which is basically the only decent way to follow the action and keep up anyway... Besides that expect the usual contradictions, the ""Hulk"" of the DB universe with a very weak background story and nonsense power (even for the series ""standards""), jumpy and weird camera angles that make you think you're watching a Jason Bourne movie (same flaw as BOG and ROF) and a significant but forgettable ending. Another failed ""reboot"".","5/10"

"Nyc_Don_DrKing","4 June 2023","Soooo where do I start...after watching the film 2x so far back to back days & going again for a 3rd time. I think back to the 1st film. Before the film started I asked myself HOW? HOW in the hell is SONY going to top the 1st entry to Miles. We know SONY has mishandled their Spidey IP in the live action department with a few given exceptions...So as I watched Gwen's story pulled LITERALLY from the comics to big screen & watched Spider-India, Spider-Punk with a twist,Scarlet Spider & the PLETHORA of Spidey characters in all its MAGNIFICENCE hit the screen. At the end of the film I answered my own question...THIS!..THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT! & I'll be damned, they SURELY did. The various art animation styles, the color palette usage, when they focused on each specific Spidey character at the time. The story arc being told & arcs they pulled from, with that creme de la creme twist myself & my son picked out once we saw Mile's mom face & knew immediately where they were going...perfection...left you begging for more. You could've told me to sit there for another 2 1/2 hrs & I would have not mind AT ALL. Knowing ahead of time this was always a 2 part film already had me excited, EVEN MORE after that ending. The group that was assembled towards the end my my my goodness. The gems of Easter eggs ontop of Easter eggs & other get you amped up surprises. At its core it had its drama & deep family story to tell, it had action, it had comedy it had suspense, it had it all, but 1st & foremost, the CORE concepts of what makes Spider-Man..Spider-Man, were showcased through & through. You can tell from the director, down to every single person/department involved with these 2 films well 3 😏hopefully soon thoroughly love the character/characters.","10/10"
"nzswanny","24 July 2017","What makes War Of The Planet Of The Apes a masterpiece? Because it has some extremely well handled dramatic moments in it, boasting visually stunning cinematography and masterful acting to carry it off. War Of The Planet Of The Apes is not just about the horror about the battle of war, it's also about the revolutionary shouts from the people being affected by it, in this case the apes. It's an emotional roller- coaster, except instead of over-done sentimentality it displays raw emotion to get into the viewer watching the film. War Of The Planet Of The Apes, in my opinion, marks as the best of the Planet Of The Apes prequel trilogy and while it isn't as good as the 60's Planet Of The Apes it remains a boasting, powerful epic despite that, proudly declaring itself in pride. Listening to the film boom over the speakers of the cinema is incredible, and the experience for this film won't be the same if you just watch it on your TV...see it at the cinema before it's too late!","4/10"

"ObviTheMargs","17 January 2024","Seriously WTF. I like Statham, and I like dumb movies but this one is a hive too far. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Plenty of bad movies I love to rewatch, but stink stank stunk, my friends. The premise itself could have worked however the unfolding story just clips along super nonsensically. Super. Nonsense. And it all goes to the script. Like this must have been a rough, ROUGH first draft and left to just go to production. In short, I am certain there will be a sequel, but OMG I hope not. ALSO, dying ones beard at his age is super funny. Eminem, Fallon, Statham - - - you're all on notice. If you make a silly movie, at least try to look less silly.","2/10"
"ocr-94520","10 May 2018","It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","10/10"
"Offworld_Colony","10 February 2020","I found Avengers Endgame difficult to watch but only because it was beautiful and painful.
There are two ways to enjoy this movie, one as a fun time heist, throwback, exciting blockbuster with some snappy oneliners and a healthy dose of gloss, the closure of some main character arcs and some significant resolution (although also with a heady dose of sequel potential of course.).The other way to view this movie is a movie in touch with the heart of grief and loss, and also just losing. It's deeply sad throughout and people try to put a brave face on as you do, but grief is no slouch and it clearly takes constant work for them all just to buck up and rally around another one of sad-faced Captain America's many speeches.
It all culminates in the death of Iron Man and the eventual death of Captain America and both men get what they want. Lives without all this pain; The burden of responsibility and honour. When Stark dies it's quick but it feels earned, and when Potts leans in to him and allows him to go, he doesn't register anything on his face because he's dying. But you hope he registers it somewhere before he does.
I'd need to see it again to appreciate the nuances and the Easter eggs but I was profoundly moved by watching these people (characters) we know well by now, in the kinds of pain we will all go through. And strangely it overtook my experience of the movie but not in a bad way.So I gave it 5 stars. When I wash it clean from my mind and watch it again. I'll be able to assess its many levels, achievements and flaws. But as a film about loss. It's superbly layered and surprisingly effective and therefore I say it's pretty much succeeded on a human level. For something with a massive green dude in spectacles and fat Thor in it, that's saying something.","10/10"

"olcare","10 January 2024","I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time..","3/10"
"oldguy7547","29 December 2023","I really liked the first Indy movies this one was a meh. It seems to me that there was one chase after another and that the producers were trying to fille time. I really liked the character that Phoebe Waller-Bridge played she was a perfect antagonist. Her character was a little see through but played very well. The effects throughout the movie and of course as usual the places shown were interesting. I did not care for the underwater scenes as for me they were a little dark. Bottom line is that it is an enjoyable movie just go in and be ready to watch and consider it a movie for the brain dead.","6/10"
"OldMovieRob","7 January 2024","Couldn't get into this one. It drags and meanders and maybe I'm just getting old but visually everything seems choppy, flashing and hard to follow. The story seems a over the place as well with far too many characters with stories going on, which seems to be how Marvel is going with the last few of their films I've seen. The sassy, i-know-more-than-you attitude of the female characters also gets a little tedious after awhile. I guess thr main thing is, I don't follow also why they had to retell Spiderman and not just roll out a new character, since this feels like a completely different character in a completely different universe. Well, whatever.","9/10"
"olgavalentovaov","30 April 2018","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.
Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","7/10"

The cybercriminality, the ""call centers', the way operations are handled.

"oliverdimitri","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","3/10"

"onepict","16 December 2023","Mads Mikkelsen is simply outstanding in this film and frankly saves it from being a rather boring movie. He is electric and every moment he is on the screen he adds drama and power and momentum to the movie. Unfortunately, we have to endure the toxic and highly unpleasant Phoebe Waller-Bridge who gives strong women a bad name simply by being the female equivalent of the annoying Shia LeBeouf. I have no idea why the powers that be thought it was a good idea to hire someone so lacking in personality and audience appeal and one can only hope she has a bright career in script writing ahead. I found myself fast forwarding through her scenes just to avoid enduring her awful acting, mannerisms and obnoxious personality Overall, perhaps I should have rated this a 7 as I did get to the end of the movie. And kudos to Harrison Ford, of course I enjoyed all his scenes and the quintessential Indy bravado. Between Mads Mikkelsen and Harrison Ford (and a far too short appearance by Antonio Banderas) this is a movie worth watching. But please can writers/directors take heed and cast likeable characters - unlike the highly unpleasant and tiresome Waller-Bridge who I am confident has huge appeal for upper class Englishmen and women. But there's a whole world out there that really doesn't like obnoxious Margaret Thatchers types.","3/10"
"OnlyAtJMart","17 February 2023","I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of.","6/10"

"oskar-nyman","28 June 2023","+
The action was good, the villian was good.The intro scene was pretty atmospheric.%
The deaged Indy looked best in the first shot we see him in, its the shot from the trailer but a little better, maybe because of the better bitrate. Later it looked not as good, some shots were ok, some looked like a low resolution ps4 game. I guess the first shot is the most important one to sell the effect tho. Maybe it looks better If you see it in non imax. Its cool that this kind of technology exits but it is not perfected yet. In Crystal skull, they hid the face when it was a too complicated shot to digitally reface the stunt double. Here they that too but in some shots they used cgi and it didnt really blend well all the time.The soundtrack was ok but like in SW Ep 9 there wasnt really any memorable parts. You recognized some reused tunes here and there from other John Williams scores.Maybe Im slow, but why didnt they go back to the river where they dropped the artifact in the beginning?-
I feel like Indy was underutilized in this movie, in favor for his god daughter. He didnt really do much except for maybe a bit in the opening prologue that made me go ""Indy frack yeah"" while the theme plays. Atleast Crystal skull had that.There was a line that the villian says when talking to Indy, among the lines of ""people dont care about men like us anymore"". Was this some kind of meta thing? This sums up the problem I had with this movie:
I watch Indy because I care. I want to see Indy be the rock star, he is a bit older now which they acknowledged, so maybe he cant physically do everything anymore, but he is older and should be more experienced. I watched it because I wanted to see Indy as the hero, not his god daughter.It wasnt wrong seeing Indy as the grumpy old grandpa but at the end I felt like he should have been utilized more as the hero.","6/10"
"ossie85","15 February 2023","If I'm honest, the Ant-Man franchise has never been a huge favourite of mine. I liked the first film enough, but the second left me a bit cold.So I can understand why many of the critics didn't like this film, if they were expecting something similar to the first two Ant-Man films.This film was more done to flesh out the greater Marvel lore, and to give the terrific Jonathan Majors a show piece for his Kang.That's not to say Ant-Man and The Wasp aren't important for the story, they provide the heart and personal stakes for us the viewers to connect with.The movie is far from perfect, but I'm in it for the world building as much as the characters. I had a lot of fun, and the good outweighs the mediocre by quite a bit.","6/10"
"ostlerb-02853","27 February 2023","Quantumania finally moves on from the ""ex con who can't get a job"" narrative to a much more competent version of Scott Long and a fresh, original story that hasn't already been impacted by the events of other movies. Frankly, I'm glad that the movie was much different than the first two. I never really felt any suspense or excitement in those.The tone of the series gets a much needed makeover. The comedy is minimal, the suspense is much higher, and the producers finally found the right music to illustrate the mood. Best of all, Scott finally transforms himself from the clumsy, annoying character he used to be to the serious, valiant fighter that I've waited 8 years for.I wasn't a fan of all the goofy, CGI characters that were introduced. And as usual, the writers attempted to inject comedy where it simply doesn't fit. In fact, the first 15 minutes are actually very cringy. Since I can't give it a 7.5 rating, I'm rounding up to 8. In reality, it's a 7.5 for me.","7/10"
"oszajcakk","19 February 2023","New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it.","4/10"

This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).","4/10"
"otto_tieleman","3 July 2023","Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse continues where Spider-man: into the spider-verse left of.What changed is the scale of the story and the with of animation used to tell the story. The first movie shook up the animation world in a positive way and we can see it's influence in movies like Puss in Boots 2. But this movie expands on it's ambition in animation to go even wilder and more inventive.All the beautiful animation won't be much if the story didn't live up to the animation. We have seen many Marvel films and tv series from Marvel/Disney that have degrade to the point of bloated CGI without any enticing stories, loveless created only to make money but don't deliver on the rich world the comic books have created. Thankfully Sony wiped the slate clean and created a unique, excited and touching story. Not only Miles Morales has an incredible story arch but every side character that is created for the story. Making all characters relatable and it makes you care.Go watch this movie if you can on the best screen you can find as it is worth your money and time and that is something we couldn't have said for a long time for a super hero movie.","10/10"

I thought Antman And The Wasp Quantumania was going to suck, but it actually wasn't horrible. For one, Jonathan Majors steals the show as Kang. He delivers a powerful performance and runs the movie the entire time. And the entire film reminds me a bit of Star Wars so thats a plus. The main problem to me is the ending and the crazy amount of plot conveniences and basic pure stupidity put in this film. I think they needed to explain somethings in this film and fix its ending to fully pull me in to the Quantum world. But overall, this was still at its central core, a fun enough, enjoyable marvel film. And at the streak marvel has been going. This film is more of a plus then a minus.","10/10"
"p-jonsson","17 May 2013","I did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.As I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with Gérard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended.

Yes it's an adrenaline ride like most statham films he'd make a great Bond but they'll probably offer him the role of a villainGreat entertainment & will make a great console gamePad. A 7/10.","7/10"
"Pairic","14 January 2024","Another film where Jason Statham floats like a butterfly stings like a bee, well he actually stings like a Murder Hornet in this caper. Not that he likes hornets, he's Adam Clay, an actual beekeeper. When online scammers clean out the accounts of a friend of his she commits suicide. Intent on revenge Clay sets out to hunt down those responsible, turns out he's a retired member of a super secret Elite group of assassins named The Beekeepers who operate outside of the Intelligence Community chain of command. Naturally he leaves mayhem in his wake but there's a conspiracy here which has a long reach and connections to the highest echelons of power. Some great hand to hand combat scenes, he takes on crooks, mercenaries and cops/feds by the score. The most unbelievable scene though is when another Beekeeper comes after him, won't reveal the details but nobody could be that crazy! While Clay is happy to shoot, strangle, stab, mutilate and burn alive the scammers and their goons he merely injures the cops/feds, a bit like Arnie in T2 kneecapping the cops. It is a very violent film though and the results are not hidden, lots of gore and corpses. Jeremy Irons dials in a performance as an Ex CIA Director. You will have to turn on your suspension of disbelief app but this is a good a action thriller. Directed by David Ayer, Written by Kurt Wimmer. 7.5/10.","8/10"

"pal05052003","29 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","3/10"
"panagiotis1993","2 February 2024","My Live Reaction / Review for The Beekeeper (2024): I have a feeling that this movie is gonna be good, let's see if im right or wrong. What is this? A group of people? A company that hacks random old people? Makes no sense. The poor lady killed herself after what happened? That's so sad. Adam is going to do something about it, I like it. Some really good fight scenes already! What Adam does is badass and everything but isnt he worried about the police? 40 minutes in and the movie is so good so far. I love that Jeremy Irons is in this one, I really enjoy his acting.So Adam was part of a secret group called the Beekeepers and now the same people will have to try and kill him? An all out war is coming, I like it. So Adam's next victim is POTUS or her son? Or both? Cant wait for Derek to die, he is so annoying! I like the president, she is honest. Wow, he gave that guy with the yellow short a really good beating. Derek is dead, hell yes. Overall the movie is pretty good. Good direction, an ok plot, good performances, intense action, fight scenes, explosions and more. It has everything you need, my rating is 8/10.","8/10"
"PANDIAN120621","30 January 2024","With haters trolling for the dumb plot and its execution it's a gentle reminder that this is a Jason Statham movie and he his just preparing for the funeral for those scammers what else one can have a base plot for an action movie ...Jason and his charm to entertain us with his amazing action scenes never gets old...
Minnie Driver is pointlessly wasted in a role with about a minute of screentime while the cop Verona who supposedly to be grieved for her mother's death instead runs around Statham is a pointless and a major drawback...The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing for powerful fighting scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Statham once again proves why he's the go-to guy for heart-pounding action. A must-watch for fans of intense storytelling and jaw-dropping combat sequences...","6/10"

Just like other big name characters like the Hulk, Hawk Eye, and Thor. Is there a flu that makes them all act the same?Terrible script writers who know nothing about Marvel Comics.Kang the Conquerer is suppose to be an over-arching villain, the most important Kang and he's like a chump in this movie. Another villain made pointless in a useless movie, just like Namor in Wakanda Forever.There's no importance or deadliness to the Villains anymore. Now Marvel is starting to trash their best villains. Why? This is basically writers who have no idea how to write from Comic to Film or know anything about the characters.Instead of establishing Modok as a good character, he's another throw away joke villain. The character belongs with A. I. M, X-men and Captain American; what's he doing in an Ant Man movie? Do Marvel Script writers even read Marvel Comics?These are hollywood writers who live in their own bubble and think the Wasp saving every part of the world, is what a character should be.Pathetic.","8/10"
"parasvanzari","3 June 2023","Honest and totally honest. If people are giving 8-9 stars for just graphics and designing & VFX, back up people, there's alot more there should be for a 9 star.It starts good, it gives you hopes, the comedy is good, but then, it gets all sentimental and emotional. I know it's needed, but it just gets so much that it kind of gets sleepy.They carry the story too slow because of this emotional backstories, not actually focusing on the main writing, I don't really think the back stories were really required so much and even more so, not so much in DETAIL.After all things said and done, the movie heads to main plotline, how to get to stop the villain, a squad is formed for that, the main character is stuck and needs to find a way out, it all gets interesting, and then, A CLIFFHANGER. End.Wasted too much time in the unnecessary and making a part 3 out of that seems like a 'loosen your pocket for more in the next one'.People giving 8-9 stars, even 10, seriously! Grow up kiddos. This movie wasn't MARVEL at all. It was Disneyland for kids.","10/10"

"parksiet","23 January 2024","I swear if I heard Jason Statham say ""I have to protect the hive"" one more time, I was about to walk out. The Beekeeper has the most bee-related puns since The Bee Movie, and that is not a good thing. The movie will be entertaining for some, but if I'm being honest, we've all seen this movie before. It's a Jason Statham action movie and does not deviate from the pattern. Heck, it's a lesser John Wick. And yet, yeah... the action is good. It's a mindless popcorn flick that escalates quickly, and some will love it for that, however, I see it maybe only being fun after having a few drinks and putting it on with a group of friends - it's pretty silly and very undemanding of its audience. Yes, The Beekeeper is indeed a very mid-January film - lots of cheap thrills and corny one-liners.","6/10"
"parth_p87_","18 February 2023","Considering last movie of ant man, i knew how antman indirectly effect teh marvel universe and this movie also stand there. Story begins with lite comedy scenes and it does not take more time to jump to get seriousness. Once that phase begins story goes in fast mode. One important thing that this movie carry about they give proper job for supporting characters but missed three buddies of Scoot. You know whom I talking about. VFX and CGI was good but not up to the mark. It may have improved if they have given time. Introduction of Daddy Kang was biggest responsibility that this carried out and I am satisfied with that. But movie took my heart in last post credit and I was like i wanted more in that scene. Over all I love this movie as always like antman first and second part does.","6/10"
"pascalbourelier","29 September 2018","This will be short, but the film in the current Hollywood landscape is a rare Gem. Pacing, acting, introduction and writing are at the top of what I've seen since a long time!I missed it in theaters, because the second opus was bad (to my personal view), even if I have always supported the Planet of the Apes series ! I regret it sorely now that I have seen this (last?) opus.If hollywood and overall audiences were able to see true great films, this one is by any standard one of those great film that brings heart before actions, do not push science where it is not needed, has authentic character and though is not exempt of mistakes and caricature on the side of the colonel, it never feels so pushy that you disconnect with the movie.So, here is my militant 10/10 and a big thank you to Matt Reeves for making a ture Planet of the Apes as we longed for so long (40 years roughly, 17 years for others!) !","10/10"

"pastor_benje","31 January 2024","I really enjoyed this. I'm a Statham fan, and I don't go into his movies expecting great depth of writing. This story was clever though and the action scenes were top notch. I always laugh when I read reviews of a movie in this genre where people complain of it being ""over the top,"" and unrealistic. That is kinda the point!There was some weak acting on the part of others in the film. That could certainly have been improved. Admittedly I kind of winced whenever the lady and the guy FBI agents were on screen. Just the same, the move hits the mark for me. Good action scenes, and a unique, very unlikable, villain.","7/10"
"pat-495-739723","6 August 2017","This movie is absolute trash. I am a huge fan of the franchise, including the first two installments of the reboot. This film was incredibly disappointing. The plot was almost non-existent, the pacing was all over the place, the tone kept juggling and the development was forced. It felt like they had no clue how to end the trilogy, so they threw together a ton of walking inserts, and landscape shots with sprinkles of action sequences sparingly used throughout. Slow movies do not bother me but pretentious garbage like this film is entirely not watchable. The solid cinematography and good use of CGI to not make up for the nonsensical plot. Do yourself a favor and wait on this one. Believe all the bad reviews, I was anxiously awaiting the release of the film, only to be let down. Biggest disappointment of the summer by far.","10/10"

"paul_haakonsen","24 June 2018","Having watched all of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, both the old classics and the newer additions to the franchise, then of course I also had to watch ""War of the Planet of the Apes"", despite its ridiculous title.""War of the Planet of the Apes"" is a very nice continuation of the storyline. Actually, it serves well enough to even be a stand-alone movie, although a lot of information is missing out if you haven't seen the other movies.The movie starts out in a fairly good pace, and it never really slows down, so once you strap yourself into your seat, just hang on and enjoy the ride.The movie has great CGI and special effects, of course. It is primed with lots of action and nicely executed action sequences. But it is not just the action that carries the movie, it is also the character progression and the storyline, which both actually play very big parts in this movie.""War of the Planet of the Apes"" had good acting performances from a pretty interesting cast, with the likes of Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn and many others.If you enjoyed the franchise thus far, then it would be a shame to miss out on the 2017 ""War of the Planet of the Apes"".","4/10"
"paul_haakonsen","29 August 2023","Having grown up watching, loving and enjoying the ""Indiana Jones"" movies ever since the first movie, I have to say that it was somewhat odd to sit down and watch the 2023 movie ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", knowing that it would be the last proper ""Indiana Jones"" movie with Harrison Ford in the iconic role. But it was a movie that had to be watched, of course, to round up the adventure that started back in 1981.The storyline in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", as written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and James Mangold, certainly looked and felt like a movie that belonged in the franchise. I found the storyline and script to be adequately entertaining and enjoyable, though it wasn't the best of storylines in the franchise. But it was entertaining for what it was. I think the script fitted nicely into the supernatural line of the previous four movies, so I had no problems with the time-travel aspect of the storyline.The acting performances in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" was good, and it was certainly nice to see Harrison Ford back in the role for one final adventure. And the moie also brought back Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies to reprise the roles of Marion and Sallah. In addition, then the movie brought new talents to the franchise, with the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Toby Jones and Antonio Banderas, so there certainly was some familiar faces and talented actors and actresses on the cast list.Visually then ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" was good. The special effects were good. However, there were some dubious moments when Harrison Ford was on the horse, where you could see it was a different actor, and also some moments when you could see that it was blatantly a CGI rendering of Harrison Ford's face, because it looked rather rigid and fake. And then there was the whole issue of making Harrison Ford younger by the use of CGI for the part of the movie that took place back in the 1940s. I can't claim that I am by any means a fan of that kind of usage of de-aging for actors and actresses, nor of fully CGI animating dead actors and actresses for movies. But of course that is a matter of personal preference.I was genuinely entertained by director James Mangold's 2023 movie ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"", despite it being the final movie for Harrison Ford. So was it a movie that saw Indiana Jones off the screen in a fulfilling manner? I hardly think so, because I was left with a sense of 'but it wasn't really a proper way to say good bye to this iconic movie character'. But the movie was entertaining nonetheless.My rating of ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" lands on a seven out of ten stars. I could and would have wished for a more meaningful good bye to Dr. Jones, but it was what it was.","6/10"

"paul-allaer","17 July 2023","As ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" (2023 release; 154 min) opens, it's the dying days of WWII, and Indy is caught posing as Nazi officer. It's not long before mayhem ensues involving yet another stolen artifact (of course!). Also caught up in the action is Indy's old friend Basil... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the first Indy movie not directed by Steven Spielberg. Instead James ""Ford v Ferrari"" Mangold steps in, and does reasonably well. The opening 20 minute sequence features a de-aged Harrison Ford, and I was surprised to see how well it worked. It felt quite natural actually. The bulk of the movie is actually set in 1969. The action scenes are a lot of fun, including a hair-raising chase in the opening sequence, and several other chase scenes later in the film. Harrison Ford can play Indiana Jones in his sleep, and looks super comfortable. Basil's daughter. Helena, is played by British actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge with plenty of spunk. I must confess I never saw the 4th Indiana Jones movie (2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), so this was my first new Indiana Jones in almost 35 years. I also admit that my expectations were quite low but since this is supposedly the very last Indiana Jones movie ever, I decided to take a chance on it. I was ultimately fairly pleasantly surprised, even though the movie is a bit too long for its own good (they could've easily trimmed this by 10-15 minutes).""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival and was released in US theaters2 weekends ago. The movie has not done well at the box, not the first and certainly not the last to underwhelm at the box office (the Mission Impossible that opened this weekend could not even get to $60 million, an absolute shocker for what was expected to be the biggest movie of the summer). The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 35 people)> If you are sitting on the fence about seeing the 5th and final Indiana Jones, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion.","8/10"

"Paula_Ferrand","28 June 2023","A good and enjoyable film despite Waller-Bridge. Her character was little convincing and it's hard to understand her motivations and objectives, they were never clear. She lacks connection and empathy in many situations, like a very immature adult, that makes it feels completely alien to the movie, like she doesn't belong there. Her interpretation feels annoying and obnoxious.However, as a fan, it makes for a nice walk through nostalgia that resumes a long and succesful saga. Ford keeps it charisma it has aged well along with Idiana Jones.I would like it more if it was directed by Spielberg himself, the spirit of the movie would be more fun.","4/10"
"paulclaassen","18 June 2018","This highly acclaimed, multi award winning film was also a huge box office success, earning $609 million on a $120 million budget. Unfortunately I was not as impressed. The visuals and effects are indeed impeccable, but that's as much as I enjoyed about the film. The fact that Pi was telling the story and the actual story were flashbacks, removed every inch of suspense, as I knew nothing was going to happen to him. Why they chose to do it that way is beyond me. It also suffered from way too many plot flaws and was anything but credible. You honestly want me to believe the tiger was under the canvas of the raft for more than a day without making an appearance or even a sound?? And what was the purpose of the weird meerkat island? Nothing their made any sense and did not contribute to the story whatsoever, apart from adding to the already long running time. When Pi finally got to shore, the tiger just ran off!! I was expecting so much more, as Pi tried gaining the tiger's trust all along, and it seemed to work, until they reached the shore. Idiotic tiger! At the end, you still don't know if everything he told actually happened or whether it was just a figment of his imagination. I'll go with the latter.","10/10"
"Paynebyname","4 May 2019","I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.","9/10"
"PaytonMArnett","19 February 2023","The first Ant-Man film was great, the second film was somewhat forgettable, and I feel this one will fall in line with the second one. The pacing and tone where off, Scott Lang got a lot of screen time, but the rest of the cast got comparatively little. The choice to tie MODOK into the first fill felt forced and strange. Paul Rudd was certainly the star, and was made the film worth watching. KANG was an entertaining villain, but didn't seem to belong in an Ant-Man film. The first Ant-Man worked so well because of its smaller scale, the large scale and shorter runtime did not work in this film's favor. The MCU is growing stale, but this shows I can still have a good time at the movies.","5/10"
"pcald-98157","30 April 2023","I am confused as to why this movie looks, sounds, and feels just like a really terrible scyfi channel movie. Dialog, terrible, acting, terrible, plot, terrible. It's like Marvel and Disney just aren't trying anymore. Wasted more than 2 hours of my life that I will not get back. I usually never write reviews, and this isn't so much as a review but more a question as to why? For the love of God why? It just seems like a cruel joke now
Studios are trying to beat each other to who can make worst movie and having being buy tickets to it. And people gladly consume this garbage too. They gladly lap it up and ask for more. God help us all.","6/10"
"PCC0921","18 February 2023","So, I'm not going to say this is a great Marvel film. However, I also won't say it is a bad movie either. There are a lot of good things in this film, but it also has things going on within it, that could have been done better. It definitely is one of those filler-movies, Marvel has to release, every now-and-then, in order to tie things together, for the bigger MCU franchise's main plot-arc. The MCU has a problem due to this, but that problem is born from many good positives, found in the MCU's past. This problem doesn't apply to the fans, but does effect the more general audience. Marvel still needs to get to that point, when they can dazzle the audience again, with a huge block-buster, cross-over event, like Avengers: End Game (2019). In the meantime, they want to take their time and create a build-up to that next huge event. The fans are okay with that, but the general audience might not be.In the case of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), it makes sense, that the third film in the trilogy, should center around the quantum realm. It is part of the Ant-Man mythos found in the comic books, plus it plays a huge role in the main MCU story. We leave the setting of San Francisco, where the first two films took place and go to a completely different setting for this film. It's a quick arrival to the quantum realm too. Director, Peyton Reed gets right into it, as the plot takes us into the quantum realm, within the first 15 minutes of the film. This is where some of the problems develop in the beginning of the film. Director Reed has so much territory he needs to cover in this film, that those plot-points, took away time needed, to revisit the main characters. The Wasp was totally overlooked in this film. Other supporting characters suffer too. The beginning of the film is so quick, it looks sloppily forced at us, in order to get into the quantum realm.The positive side to this approach is, it creates a whole new different Ant-Man film. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), contains a side to his character, that we don't get to see a lot. Rudd was tapped to bring in a comedic-side to the role, much like Michael Keaton was for Batman (1989). Both of these actors were able to sell their characters, as serious, emotional, superhero fodder, but also added that comedy splash into the design of the characters. These are great performances by both actors. It was very evident with Rudd in the first two Ant-Man films. This time however, Peyton Reed decides to tap more into the tough, brave, hero-side of Ant-Man, seen in Avengers: End Game (2019), by showing us a more mature, emotional, serious, successful, liberated Scott Lang. All of his head-aches from the past were gone, however the five year gap he lost with his daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton), weighs in on his mind.With the comedy-side of Scott Lang subdued, some of the comedy is dished-out to Michael Douglas' Hank Pym in this film. Both of the parents of Hope Van Dyne, the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), play a big role in this film. It was their depictions of Hank and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), that are stand-outs. Janet is tough and Hank is still cool. They are the original Ant-Man and the Wasp in this film. There are some new characters, that I thought were pretty good, like Veb (voice of David Dastmalchian), a slime creature, obsessed with holes, Quaz (William Jackson Harper), who can read minds and this cool, robot-creature, who's whole head is an energy-blaster. Can't find his name. He had no speaking parts. However, some of the new characters seemed slightly dull. What does pay-off well is the performance of Jonathan Majors as Kang, the Conqueror. His part in the film, is explained well, so the general audience should be satisfied and the fans should see some of the answers they have been looking for, since the end of season one of Loki (2021). This is a film, that is just going-through-the-motions, for the bigger picture and can be dull to some at certain moments. However, it does effectively end Payton Reed's trilogy. I'm sure, eventually, as time goes by, this film will slip down to the lower levels of MCU rankings, but for now, it sets up many interesting scenarios and new questions of things to come.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.","7/10"
"peacedisturber","30 April 2019","By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though).","6/10"
"PedanticEditor","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe. Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.10. Neither did Dr. Strange.11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","9/10"
"Pedro_H","2 January 2014","Told in the style of a story-within-a-story (very Heart of Darkness, the original novel) a middle aged man tells two stories (to a visiting journalist) of how he - as a teenager - survived a shipwreck thanks to a lifeboat. But which does the listener believe? The standard version or a very bizarre version involving circus animals? In the ""bizarre"" a boy (Suraj Sharma) is set adrift on a lifeboat with only a wild tiger for proper company. The tiger being part of a zoo being transported to Canada. The tale of how they get along and/or both survive takes over most of the rest of the film.What an unlikely premise for a film this is! I came to it with an open mind and left it with a bit of an open mind too. Lots of thrills and spills and the usual special effects wham-bams which modern cinema has to offer (I didn't see it in 3D) but I am not sure what this was supposed to be about (other than basic survival) or why it needed to be structured the way it was.The set-up is simply tedious and since the production seemed to want to shout its central novelty from the rooftops it became a bit of a wrist glancer as it worked its way towards this - inevitable - central novelty. Either we get to know the people well (think The Deer Hunter) or don't bother at all. I mean Gérard Depardieu in a cameo role? For what purpose? The central character is mad as a bat anyway. He goes out on deck in a storm with nothing on but a shirt. Do you know how cold it is in the middle of an ocean? He dances about as the cross waves crash over him. Oh what fun it is to have ice cold waves crash over you! Laugh a minute.Given there is little else to see or talk about (and I don't want to start spoilers) how does a wild tiger (who only feeds on land anyway) catch anything from a boat. And how much fresh water does it need a day. Apart from lots? Not very realistic to nature is it? Like War and Peace is something about Russia this is something about religion. I suppose people who escape disaster tend to believe in God more than those who don't. Might just be luck though.The good thing is that I found it generally entertaining. And Shama is solid, although he doesn't have to do much other than be thrown around in front of a green screen. Would be very tedious to watch twice (apart from seeing in its intended 3D on a big screen) and that is the best acid test of a good movie.","10/10"
"pedrocf14","12 June 2023","Just watched this amazing masterpiece and all i can say is WOW.I went into the cinema expecting a good movie but i never thought that i was about to watch the best Spider-Man movie EVER and probably the movie of the year! This sequel DESERVES nominations fellas!From the moment the movie starts until the very end you are HOOKED.The animation and character designs are absolutely amazing, all of the fight scenes are so well done and ""choreographed"", what a fantastic job by the animation team.The soundtrack is great and really fits into the movie and the characters like a glove.The pace is exquisite and really allows the characters to develop and show growth as the story progresses whilst we, the viewers, dont lose interest in it.An incredible amount of references are made in this movie to different Spider-Man Universes, such has Andrew Garfields, Tom Hollands and even the video game Spider Man gets a shout out! What a really fun way to acknowledge all the past Spider-Mans and to show that they really are all connected and to put Miles Morales Spider-Man next to all the other ones.The humor was actually surprising, because even though you are expecting to laugh when watching a Spider-Man movie, this sequel has really good timing on most of the jokes and one of the funniest characters of any Marvel franchise, in Spider Punk. Kudos to Daniel Kaluuya for giving us such a voice acting performance.This is, without a doubt, the best movie i have watched this year. It has emotions, growth and action, all we need in a super hero movie.It ends with a much expected cliff hanger for the next one and you best believe im going to watch it as soon as it comes out.9.5/10 - Absolutely Amazing.","10/10"
"pedropittss","14 April 2022","For those who say Dragon Ball has no story and is too shallow, this film shows the magnitude of the anime mythology about a warrior race that was decimated by a tyrant. From the very first scene on Planet Vegeta you realize how the creators wanted to give the fans a story worthy of such intense battles, and put intense ones at that! Every frame of this animation has a detail, every aspect of the fights has a meaning. This movie also turned a lot of things into canon that were not official, and it's something that the Dragon Ball Super series itself has been doing. A film at the height of Dragon Ball, with characters that we are passionate about and new ones that we have already gained respect for. Congratulations TOEI.","7/10"
"PedroReviews","3 February 2024","Jason Statham returns to the screen in ""The Beekeeper"" (2024), wielding his fists and signature stoicism with gritty aplomb. While the plot might be as familiar as your worn-out leather jacket, the action sequences pack a punch that'll leave you buzzing with adrenaline.Statham embodies Clay, a beekeeper with a past as an elite operative known as ""The Beekeeper."" When his kindhearted landlady becomes the victim of a phishing scam, Clay unleashes his particular brand of revenge, his sting sharp and unforgiving. Think Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills with a beehive beard and a penchant for blunt instruments.The plot unfolds like a well-worn action movie map. You've got the wronged protagonist, the ruthless villain (played with deliciously evil glee by Stanley Tucci), and a trail of bodies leading to a showdown. But hey, sometimes comfort food just hits the spot, and ""The Beekeeper"" serves up a satisfying helping of vengeance with a side of well-choreographed fight scenes.Now, let's talk action. Statham does what he does best: dispatching bad guys with balletic brutality. Bullets whiz past him like angry bumblebees, but Clay remains miraculously unscathed. It's a bit like watching Neo dodge bullets in ""The Matrix,"" but somehow grounded in the grimy reality of this film's world. It's over-the-top, sure, but hey, that's part of the fun, right?What ""The Beekeeper"" lacks in narrative originality, it makes up for in its timely context. The film touches on themes of online scams and the vulnerability of everyday people, adding a layer of relevance that resonates in today's digital age. It's not exactly groundbreaking social commentary, but it gives the action a touch of weight beyond pure entertainment.So, is ""The Beekeeper"" a masterpiece of cinema? No, but it's a perfectly enjoyable action flick that delivers exactly what you expect from a Jason Statham movie: bone-crunching action, a sprinkle of dark humor, and a plot that, while predictable, doesn't get in the way of the punches and bullets. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush and a reminder that Statham can still kick some serious butt, then ""The Beekeeper"" might just sting you in the right way. Just remember, don't try any of his moves at home...or maybe just don't get involved in phishing scams.","6/10"
"PedroReviews","30 January 2024","Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.","1/10"
"penelopemmorris","8 June 2023","I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!","6/10"

"PerryAtTheMovies","13 January 2024","6.4/10 (Recommend)My first 2024 film of the year, and I will say that I wasn't disappointed that it was. As much as this film is like any other Jason Statham film it feels more solid overall. The story is much better than I anticipated. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. The story progresses well, but has room for shortfalls especially around the last third of the film. The acting is top-notch for what this type of action film is. It's weird seeing Josh Hutcherson in the role he's in, but he does manage to pull it off better than I thought. The fight scenes leave much to be desired at times. Yes, they're cool and have some awesome shots, but there's certain aspects that logic can't penetrate. Not just the hand to hand aspects, but also with the weapons being used and the people using them. Don't get me wrong. It's still entertaining, but when you start boiling down the logics it can ruin it a little bit. Some of the visuals related to explosions are a little wonky, but they aren't domineering. Overall, this is a really enjoyable film. It's one I would definitely watch again. The runtime is decent, but felt a little long by the time the conclusion came. The acting is good, the story is more exciting than expected, but the visuals and logics lack at times. In the end I would recommend this as a film to check out.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","8/10"

"Personian","28 July 2020","I detect an earthy/Woody bouquet, with hints of Lord of the Rings, Apocalypse Now, The Stand, 28 Days Later, The Great Escape, the Bible -- New Testament and Old -- and Shakespeare. Snowy, gritty mouth feel. Pairs well with epic Westerns and Kurosawa -- although any epic Western pairs well with Kurosawa. ... Actually, there is such a strong unity message here, and so many powerful performances from the motion capture actors, flawless special effects, gorgeous photograpy and epic scope ... it's so beautiful. There is one moment, for instance, in which a character who represents evolution on its way up is dying, and a character who represents evolution on its way down communicates a metaphor to him at that last moment. Something that humanity hadn't yet lost, but which the apes hadn't necessarily learned yet. All the apes gathered around find so much suprising meaning in the gesture, as it sinks in, and we realize what an amazing gift given to a friend at such a time. And it all happens in just a few seconds. Beautiful. The whole film is like that. Slow-going, not something you would want to see outside comfortable circumstances, but well worth the time and concentration. Does not shirk from either realism or thoughtfulness.","5/10"
"perval","19 August 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is very close to be a masterpiece.The movie exceeded my expectations and is even better than the previous movie in the trilogy which was incredibly good.This film is the definition of epic!The film has a very dark tone that is similar to The Dark Knight trilogy( I don't say it steals from it I just say it has a similar tone).War for the Planet of the Apes has great effects,a beautiful score by Micheal Giacchino,an interesting,character driven story with complex,three dimensional characters and some incredible performances.The characters as I mentioned are complex and developed(mostly Caesar and the antagonist the Colonel).Almost all of the characters in the film are dark and serious except one ape who serves as the comic relief in the film.His character was a risk because normally in such a dark movie a character like this would feel forced but he was lovable and was a nice addition to the overall film.Caesar's character was incredible,well developed and his decisions had impact to the story.The antagonist was also very interesting and his actions were justified by his backstory.The acting in the film was amazing.The motion captured performances by the supporting cast were very good.As I mentioned the performance of Woody Harrelson was unbelievable and the best performance in the film was Andy Serkis as Caesar.His motion capture performance was incredible and it was Oscar worthy.In a Nutshell War of the Planet of the Apes is near perfect with breathtaking visuals,great music,mind blowing performances and a character driven story with complex,three dimensional characters","10/10"

"Pete-230","5 May 2018","Lotsa flashing lights and loud noises, little else. Went home and watched ""The Wolverine"" (the second one) to be reminded of what I like in a popcorn flick.","2/10"
"pete-murphy97","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions.

No.Overall it's a really fun film, happy to see ant man have a third instalment and join that legendary class for marvel.Good adventure film, great action, great comedy and great family film!!Paul Rudd delivers yet again, as his most iconic role as Scott Lang. He finally reaches the level of respect in the MCU. Of course marvel changed the actress and Google it but she only found out on social media she was being recast.. but Cassie was good and the relationship was cool.This film is basically an ant man titled movie about kang tbe conquerer.They didn't do him ultimate and true justice IMO as if they went clear comic book the outcome would be vastly different. But Jonathan majors is Kang aka he who remains aka lol you get it. This will be amazing once the story is complete but they need to make him a true threat..Overall 6/10. Without going into details. Hire me for more!!Pewa4real on the I.g.","7/10"
"petercarlsson-92297","2 July 2023","This is not a Indiana Jones movie. This is a ""Indiana Jane"" movie. The whole show is about making the very unlikable Helena-character the star of the movie. She have all the good lines (or at least that was the writers intention).At the same time they have made Indiana Jones an old, depressed man that all through the movie is patronised by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She abuses Indy by hitting him, making fun of his ideas and knowledge, and even trying to kill him. Is that fun watching? Ni it's not, it's depressing and to be honest straight out insulting to the viewer and true Indy fan.So this 300 million mess is also boring. The action scenes are just CGI and is not taken seriously and therefore only becomes distractions of the story. And the story... it's even worse with logical gaps the size of Grand Canyon. But the writers don't care, they make a 12 year old fly a plane, and land it. That's the level of realism we get.So, please save your hard earned money and see the first movie instead. That one still shines while this is one is pure garbage.","7/10"

They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer.","1/10"
"PeteThePrimate","16 October 2019","A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it.
No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other).","7/10"
"PeteThePrimate","3 July 2023","For me, this film ranks on a par with the Holy Grail with ROTLA being my favourite. Kate Crapshaw ruined the Temple of Doom and the less said about the Crystal Skull the better. Upon reflection, this film is more about Jones than the actual dial. His longing for the days of adventure and his obvious dislike of his current lot as a lecturer no-one really listens to. The opening 20 minutes or so are well done, good use of CGI etc and the main film moves along at a decent pace. One small criticism is that the film lacks the humour of the first 3 and there was less verbal sparring between Ford and Waller-Bridge, probably because of his dislike of the way she earns a living. I thought the Director did a decent job and after the last 2 films I didn't miss Spielberg's direction. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I hope this is the last one and that the studio allow the franchise to pass into history gracefully without any other prequels or sequels.","7/10"
"petra_ste","2 July 2023","In The Monkey's Paw (spoilers for a 100 years old horror classic, I guess), the protagonists, after the death of a loved one, use a cursed artifact to bring him back, only to find a shambling undead monstrosity knocking at their door.Being a movie nerd in these days is a similar experience: the franchises you loved as a kid keep coming back, and for a while, maybe after a decent trailer, you are happy and optimistic... but then you see them and regret their return.In fact, Hollywood just can't let a beloved series end at the right moment. Alien should have ended with Aliens, and it got a diarrhea of terrible sequels, prequels and spin-offs; Terminator with T2, and I've lost count of the reboots; Star Wars with Return of the Jedi, and it got the awful sequels (I'm giving the prequels a pass because they at least tried to tell an interesting story)...... and, of course, Indiana Jones should have ended with The Last Crusade. It would have been an amazing trilogy (I have my issues with Temple of Doom but oh boys, is it looking better in retrospect), and now it has not one but two pointless sequels.So, is this one better or worse than Skull? I'd say more or less on par: not terrible and unwatchable but clunky and mediocre.Ford was my favorite actor as a kid (""Imagine being both Indy and Han Solo!""), and he gives it all here, but the sad truth is, he was already too old in Skull, and that was 15 years ago.Mangold is a solid director but Indy movies live and die on the strength of their set-pieces, and he isn't prime Steven Spielberg. Then again, who is? Not even Spielberg himself nowadays, since the set-pieces in Skull already sucked.Mangold keeps the camera too close so we do not get the geography of the action; his set-pieces are all momentum and no triumphant release. See the scene with the underwater relic and the eels, a cool premise which peters out into nothing. Also, the protagonists (especially Indy) rarely if ever do anything COOL to resolve the action - a crack of the whip, a last-second dive: they are just there, ping-ponging between different obstacles.Story construction is bloated, with pointless characters (the governative agents, the Moroccan mobster), setups without payoffs (""continental drift"") and endless tedious exposition: a scene with Waller-Bridge (moderately less annoying than I was expecting, but it was a low bar) smugly decrypting a tablet with a clue feels like the longest ten hours I've ever spent in a movie theater.Here's a hint, scriptwriters: characters dealing with treasure hunt clues is only interesting if we, the audience, can also SEE the clue and GUESS the possible answer. Otherwise, it's like watching someone on the bus mumble as he does his Sudoku, and you can't even peek over his shoulder.Dial of Destiny takes a weird turn in the last act and I sort of wish they had embraced the sheer cheesiness of it. I enjoyed a couple of scenes (the prologue is decent enough), but, if you absolutely need a good Indy sequel, play the old adventure game The Fate of Atlantis.5/10.","7/10"
"petrxpp","5 July 2023","Harrison Ford is really trying his best, but he's left for this alone. In fact him tripping over almost everything around. The fifth Indy is visually unattractive and in some moments regularly repulsive, but mostly it has a boring story full of boring characters and especially the villains are a bunch of uninteresting idiots who are not scary at all. Mads Mikkelsen looks like he's about to cry the whole time. Mangold directs it all without striving for invention, and the result is, at best, a passable craft somewhere on the level of two, Treasure Hunters and a little bit above Uncharted, which is certainly not praise. It lacks the style, imagination and obvious joy that accompanied the first three and partly even the fourth part. Film without a soul.","7/10"
"pg-tsinc","31 July 2017","The best of the New trilogy was 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)' which I give 8.5 and I saw it a few times with pleasure. The second one: 'Dawn of the Planet... (2014)' was awful 1.0, as most of the remakes are. They put you in front of a 'fait accompli' when it would have been interesting to 'see' how the apes got in control of the earth (not only the hint about the ape flu). The last one, 'War for the Planet of the Apes (2017' is film in a wardrobe. It contains some elements that should have been develop in the second film. The 'teaser' misleads you about the action, in fact it's a long boring film, with 'cheap close up scenes' that you will have to endure. I give it a 2.0","9/10"
"Pgle05","4 September 2022","War for the Planet of the Apes is as near a perfect film as you'll ever get. It manages to surpass Dawn in just about every aspect, which is a huge achievement. The pacing is perfect, the score is phenomenal, and the CGI is out of this world. You can't give the special effects team enough credit, what they've done for this film is truly magnificent. Andy Serkis is oustanding as Caesar and I'm fully aboard the Oscar train! Woody Harrelson plays a great villain and is owner of the one and only expositional scene in the film. It truly is a masterpiece and caps off the trilogy like I never thought possible. A remarkable film.","9/10"
"Phil_M_A_Kerr","11 January 2024","I knew what I was walking into. Director David Ayer & writer Kurt Wimmer are no novices to the B+ action genre.John Wick has been taking up all the lone-killing-machine real estate of recent years. Where Wick leans into assassin/fantasy, Beekeeper does well to stay relevant. Turning on internet scams, dirty money, sketchy government officials, & family ties, it lays an acceptably current foundation. No, it's no Pulitzer, but heavyweights Statham, Rashad, Irons, Driver, Hutcherson, et al, & a competent supporting cast hit the right dramatic beats along the way. There's room for slightly better characterisation but one appreciates that the set armourer has priority over the acting coach in the high body count genre.My minor quibble is with the ""jello"" effect video cinema cameras suffer from. Not really suited to action films but when you're shooting fast and lean, who can afford the crispness of the film (celluloid) frame these days?","9/10"

With climax being...dun dun dun...to be continued.This movie was awful.They over played the art style. Like really, each universe needs its own art style. Truth be told it detracted from the story. I had to revisit portions because I was taking out of the story by the obnoxious flickering and flowing colors. It worked in the last one cause you used one back ground. But when the background becomes a character...you have no story.And whats more, your main villain is a good guy who will switch to reluctantly following Miles in the next film...who knows, maybe even laying his life down cause Miles made him a believer.YAWN!!! I had to switch to different activities 4 times in this movie because that is how unwatchable this film is.The one compelling character, Spider-punk, was so authentic he is incomprehensible by american audiences. I watch tons of english set films, but they literally had spider-punk mumble his cockney. Absolutely the worst spiderman film ever.","10/10"
"phoenixinvictus","1 August 2019","Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no...","8/10"
"phoenixinvictus","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","5/10"
"phoenixinvictus","7 October 2017","Nobody likes to watch the hero die, but I could not think of a more dignified way for a leader and warrior to die. I believe that the negative reviews are due to expecting an apocalyptic battle between humans and apes where in this glorious showdown one species would prevail. We see a battle-weary Ceasar who is tired of bloodshed and is still dealing with the repercussion of Korda's treachery. There are some disturbing allegories that this movie reveals in some parts like the African slave trade, the World War II Holocaust and the Native American Trail of Tears. There is a lot of suffering and hardships to overcome in order to survive.There were two things which bothered me in this movie. One was how humans are portrayed in the film, they are either evil or have major character flaws, while the apes are just victims trying to survive persecution; the other was the ""virus"" mutating and devolving humans to a more primitive state, which to me was too unbelievable to accept.","5/10"

They all speak English too - remarkable.The highly predictable and ultimately boring story is on a wholly insufficient scale to call itself a war for a planet.

Taking place in the year 1969 Indy is a retire college professor living in New York City who will soon have to race to retrieve an ancient artifact known as the 'Dial of Archimedes' that has the power create a portal in time, before a nefarious Nazi nemesis from his past, Dr. Voller, terrifically played by Mads Mikkelsen, and his murderous thugs, memorably played by Brad Holbrook as the sleazy and malicious Kiaber, and Olivier Richters as the towering muscle-bound killer Hauke, get a hold of it and change the course of history by making sure the Nazis win World War II. Indy will be reluctantly aided by his Goddaughter Helena, marvelously played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and her young sidekick Teddy, wonderfully played by Ethan Isidore. Skillful direction by Mangold, superlative supporting performances by Toby Jones, Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renee Wilson, and Thomas Kretschmann. Exquisite cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, exhilarating action sequences that are sensational, magnificent visual effects, with the great John Williams' timeless score adding a grandeur to this wonderful motion picture.

The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","8/10"

"pjgs200","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","11 June 2023","'Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023)' is overwhelmingly fantastic. I'm still buzzing just thinking about it. If the first flick put the bar for stylised animation in the stratosphere, this just catapulted it into another dimension. It's hard to put into words just how viscerally vibrant and visually stunning it is. Its set-pieces simply hit different. The animation, the energy, the aesthetics, the choreography, the music, the sound design, everything just comes together in its unique brand of finely-tuned controlled chaos that keeps each and every exhilarating moment crystal clear even when there's a million different things happening all at once. It's phenomenal. It isn't afraid to pump the breaks every once in a while, too. It slows down considerably to develop its characters and explore their relationships with one another. It's actually quite an emotional experience at times. It has an unconventional structure and, as a result, it takes some pretty big swings with its story. There are some sequences that could have been tightened up and I really wish the picture had retained its original Part One title just to temper people's expectations, but the fact that this film's biggest flaw is simply that it ends is almost unbelievable. I can't say it's better than 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' because it's essentially only half of what it's eventually going to be, but it's a miracle that it's at least as good as that masterpiece (and even outperforms it in terms of sheer spectacle). If they manage to stick the landing with the upcoming sequel (which I have no doubt they will), this is going to be one of the best five-hour movies ever made.","9/10"

Even then, the effects in 'Life Of Pi (2012)' aren't all that impressive and haven't held up nearly as well as many pictures of a similar age (not that old at all I'll add) or even older, as well as including a few odd design decisions, such as evolving aspect ratios, that seem sort of justifiable but ultimately distracting. Its somewhat confusing commentary on spiritualism and the nature of truth is actually a nice conceit, but isn't fully formed enough to warrant its rampant lack of conclusiveness or make up for its inherent failings to tell a griping tale. 5/10","8/10"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","7/10"
"pkulkes","27 January 2019","This is the first time I saw Dragon Ball on the big screen and I must admit, I got blown away. The pace of the movie is a bit slow in the beginning but that is because they have to establish the character of Broly or else the whole flick would not make sense. But as soom as the action started I was really impressed with the animation quality and the choreography of the fights. This is a must see for any FB fan!","8/10"
"Plaidrocker32","25 February 2018","Most of the reviews I'm reading on this site are people who are treating this film as a standalone. It seems to me that the people seeing this movie don't even realize that this is the 3rd installment of a trilogy. I've read reviews stating things such as this film has no character development and we don't know anyone. Most of these characters we met during Rise of the Planet of the Apes and again in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Please get your facts straight before writing a review.","10/10"
"planktonrules","11 April 2013","By the time I got to see this film, the Oscars were long past and there already were a ton of reviews for ""Life of Pi"". On top of that, I have noticed that for big pictures which most everyone likes, I rarely have much to say. After all, I agree with the majority--""Life of Pi"" is a very good film. So, my review will be brief.THE reason to watch this film is pretty simple: You cannot say that the movie reminds you of anything you've ever seen before or since. Sure, you could try comparing ""Life of Pi"" to ""Avatar""--but that is only because they both used gobs of CGI to create fantastic stories. But the story itself, is so original. In addition, the acting, direction and artistry of the movie is tops. While I would agree with the Oscar folks that ""Argo"" was a better film, it wasn't by much. Well worth your time.","9/10"
"planktonrules","21 June 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series.","4/10"
"plargreg","16 December 2020","This movie is bland and kinda empty, i dont understand the hype at all.

"plasticanimalz","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","9/10"
"Platypuschow","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","10/10"

"pmac429","18 January 2019","This movie did such a great job of making Broly a likeable, interesting character. So much better than Broly's original (non canon) origin. The animation, music, and fight sequences were spectacular. Also bringing Gogeta into canon was long overdue.The one small issue I had was Goku's redone origin. It was taken right from the pages of Dragon Ball Minus. It worked, it was in many ways more heartfelt than the original origin. The only problem is that it contradicts Raditz in the show. I'm fine with Bardock's TV special being erased. Because although yes it is amazing, this movies take on Bardock and Goku's relationship was also very good. But in the show, when Raditz comes to earth he explains to Goku that he was sent to Earth to destroy is because it was profitable. Which contradicts why Bardock would've sent him to Earth. And it contradicts that Bardock did it at all.I guess the way to pass up that idea is that Gine and Bardock lied to Raditz and told him he was sent to Earth to kill everyone and it was profitable. But it is still a slight annoyance.Overall without that small nitpick this movie was fantastic. It was fresh and original, while also providing a great amount of fan service.10/10 would recommend","3/10"

"pmtelefon","22 July 2023","When I went to the theater today (AMC Westbury, NY) was I wasn't really expecting much. ""Indians Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" fits in fine with the other movies in the series. ""Dial of Destiny"" takes a long time to get going but after the first hour, it's actually pretty good. Harrison Ford looks good at times. Other times he looks old. Then there are times when he looks really old. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is not nearly as annoying as people are saying. She's fine in this movie. I had a hard time adjusting to how the movie looked for quite a while. However, I thought the last hour looked great. I'm not the biggest fan of the Indiana Jones franchise (I only like the first and third movies) but I can't see any real fan of the series being let down by ""Dial of Destiny"".","7/10"

"politicidal","13 August 2023","'Quantumania' is on the lower end of the MCU but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's more of a standalone adventure that happens to feature not one but two generations of Ant-Man and the Wasp.The CGI effects for the Quantum Realm and the various action scenes look pretty; and lead to some rather original designs for the settings and creatures. I know that Marvel Studios has gotten flack for shortchanging their effects artists, but their work paid off here. There's some stellar imagery to behold in this movie.Paul Rudd is great in this along with Jonathan Majors as the new villain Kang the Conqueror. For all this movie's faults, Kang is not one of them. He's menacing in a subtle way but can be bombastic when the moment calls for it. But I will say it's strange that Kang is not in the movie as much as you would expect. With Rudd as Scott Lang, he's likable as usual and his motivations are immediately sympathetic. He's a good everyman for a weird story like this taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Returning cast members Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Evangeline Lilly are not bad in this but it seems like they have less to do. Kathryn Newton takes over as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie and though not badly acted, her character is kind of annoying. It's one of those daughter characters who are written as a know-it-all in the mistaken belief that it makes them look smart.For all the controversy surrounding Bill Murray, which I think is overblown, he is not in the movie that much. It's a glorified cameo where he plays a very obscure Marvel character. Corey Stoll comes back as Darren Cross who in this universe becomes the hideous villain MODOK. This is a character who should be threatening but he's really more annoying than actually sinister.The movie just kind of feels overblown with the stunning visuals and scope. Yet also underwritten. A lot of key information is told via flashback or exposition dumps. As if it was a re-shoot or a scene was just cut. I will say it didn't feel long since it's about two hours and that feels like enough. It really doesn't waste time .Without going into spoilers too much, you do think the movie is setting up high stakes and for some characters to make the ultimate sacrifice. And that does happen but not the way you think it might.","1/10"

It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me.","6/10"

In other words, it's not afraid to make you feel things and maybe scare your kids a little, despite the PG rating.Comparisons may not always be the best thing, but I believe this movie is better made than No Way Home.The twists at the end were completely unexpected. Overall, the final chapter was set up in a fantastic way.","9/10"

Screenplay : Check. Acting performance : Check. Visual effect : Check. Cinematography : Check. Story and plot : Check.I doubt that the book reader will feel that something essential from the book has missing (like mostly happen with book-adaptation movie). The movie couldn't have been ruined the book. Not with this version, I am sure. In fact, I would love run to the bookstore now and have it my own. Nothing like telling it too fast, or too little, or too much.This is the great movie with a great story.

"powellian6","4 June 2023","Wow I cannot believe how good this movie was. I expected it to be extremely good based of trailers and the enjoyment I had with Into The SpiderVerse (2018) but this takes everything to the next level.Sony Pictures Animation has made the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing animated film ever made. It's incredibly impressive to see the layers and layers of animation. The color is beautiful vibrant and bright constantly changing color schemes that fit the moods and characters of those that are in frame. It's an excellent way to add an layer of depth within this world that in real time would be extremely hard to capture. I honestly have no idea how you make a movie like this.The music is phenomenal as I expected. Channeling from lo fi chill music to high octane beats and chilling numbers across the board this has some of the best music in any animated film.The big catch for most people is that this is an incomplete film. While it does leave us on the edge of our seats asking for me the film itself is a complete story with certain characters. Sure the whole thing isn't quite settled but I don't expect the last one to miss at all especially since it will be out next year and it's already made.This is the best Spider-Man movie ever made and might even run into the next greatest spider man movie ever made establishing itself as possibly the greatest superhero trilogy of all time. Without a doubt see this movie.","9/10"

"pranav_2001","23 November 2012","We have always been told that value of Pi is best calculated as 22/7 but you wouldn't know that 355/113 give a more accurate value of Pi than 22/7. However, using 22/7 makes it easier for to do calculations and that's the reason why it is used often.Done with beating around the bush... time to criticize!From the time movie start you can't help but notice the ""beautiful"" picturization and cinematography throughout. Add to that the life-like sound affects make you experience the movie almost in real time. This movie shows the wrath of ocean on its survivors and its destructive powers. There have been several movies made about survivors in wild or islands or the sea. This movie makes the survival journey even harder by making the human survive on a small rescue boat with a Royal Bengal Tiger. In my opinion, the presentation of this movie on the big screen was flawless. Plot revealed below.But you can never have a good movie experience until the actors ""live the movie"" and convince their audience that it all happened for real. Pi's role is taken by two people, Suraj Sharma when he was younger and Irfan Khan, the older Pi who narrates his life experience to a novel writer. Both have acted very well for their roles, but the role of honest looking younger-Pi seemed to make older Pi's role look a little weaker. During Pi's struggle to survive on a small boat with the fierce tiger, he realises a lot of things, most of it is self realization, the way he loses hope and regains it and the mysterious things he sees in his voyage makes the fictional story intriguing. What I liked about the movie was how Pi starts enjoying the little things he was left with in the rescue boat and how important it becomes for him. But, the most interesting part of the movie is how the boy and tiger learn to survive together and realize that each of them played a big part in keeping them alive.What makes a movie more unrealistic is a big negative for me. I didn't like extra affects that make the ocean look beautifully clear and magical. Another flaw in the story is the way it starts and the way it ends seem to have no connection. In the beginning Pi, as a younger kid seems to be furiously looking see the meaning of life, religion and God. By the end of it, I would have expected that the story would come with a clearer answer. The story makers somehow didn't make the ends meet.My suggestion: Pi is a good movie to experience. Watching it in 3D makes the movie experience even better.","9/10"
"pranayjalvi","1 February 2024","The Beekeeper is an engaging ride, and once the action starts it never lets up. Jason Statham did what he always does best, fighting with a plain face and a lot of action. There are plenty of enjoyable moments here, and audiences who want nothing more than a Jason Statham beat-'em-up will surely be satisfied.There's a half-hearted plot twist that doesn't land. Mostly, however, this is a film about explosions and bad guys getting their comeuppance. Fast cuts and more than 50 credited stuntmen and stuntwomen make for, well, buzzy spectacle. A semi-confusing script and heavy-handed direction from David Ayer muddle the proceedings, but enough inspired pizazz and Statham's earnest delivery of lines like ""I protect the hive"" just barely bring it all home.My Rating : 6.5/10.","6/10"

It's mind-bending spectacle in service of a thrilling story about a teenager facing the horrifying possibility that he can't fix everything.

"pressboard","15 June 2023","I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time.","5/10"

"Prismark10","21 October 2023","I admired Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I did not like it enough, it was not memorable enough and it was more interested in leaving it all to a sequel.Miles Morales has to deal with a villain called The Spot. He was an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during a collider explosion. He now blames Miles for his condition as he also brought a spider from another dimension that bit Miles, giving him spidey superpowers.Meanwhile Miles collides with Gwen Stacy, although she is from another dimension as well, where she is also Spider-Woman.In short Miles and Gwen as well as others chase the Spot through the multiverse. Only the Spot has plans of his own.The film starts off slowly, a crawl before getting supercharged. It just lacks the punch and effervescence of the first movie in this cartoon series.","10/10"
"Prismark10","22 April 2023","Given Disney's takeover of 20th Century Fox meant they got an insight of the expanding world of James Cameron's new Avatar movie.Quantumania is very much set in a CGI heavy multiverse. Ant-Man begins in a lighthearted way until Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has to spring his teenage activist daughter from the police cells.It seems Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to explore the Quantum Realm with a newly built device. This is bad news as far as Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) is concerned. She spent decades inside there and has harboured some secrets about it.Before the latest experiment is shut down, they are transported inside the weird, wonderful psychedelic world of the Quantum Realm. They meet an old friend of Janet, Lord Krylar (Bill Murray.)Now things have changed, everyone is afraid of Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors.) He once saved Janet until she found out what kind of person he really was.Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is light and frothy. It has all the nourishment value of a McDonalds Thick Shake. It is CGI heavy made in the new fangled virtual production StageCraft set.The story is very much the kind of seen it before in superhero movies. I even knew it would have an offbeat intro and song before the movie started.The film introduces Kang but this all powerful enemy underwhelmed in his main outing.","7/10"
"Prismark10","3 June 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes starts of a with an exhilarating battle scene in the forest between apes and humans. The humans are no match to the now battle hardened apes led by Caesar who shows the human survivors mercy and offers them a truce.However the soldiers led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and aided by a few of Koba's surviving ape supporters, attack Caesar's fortress killing his wife and son. Caesar swears revenge but finds himself imprisoned with the rest of the apes who are treated as slaves having to build a wall. The humans are still affected by Simian flu which makes some of them mute. A mute girl, a zoo monkey and a few of Caesar's allies must mount a rescue attempt of the imprisoned apes so Caesar can take them to a desert paradise.The story may have inspiration from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness with the Colonel character. However after a promising beginning this becomes a dull, stupid film. The story is clunky, illogical and ponderous. As the final part of a trilogy that promised so much, I thought they might deliver a conceptually interesting ending but that was too much to hope for.","10/10"
"Prismark10","3 May 2018","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","6/10"

"Prismark10","9 July 2023","When Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released, it heralded the end of the whip cracking archeologist. By the early 1990s, Spielberg and Lucas were trying to fit in a fourth movie.It eventually emerged as The Kingdom of Lost Skull in 2008. I think it was shot in George Lucas's backyard, with all the money he accumulated, he has a very big yard.Now Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny acknowledges that Harrison Ford is no spring chicken. Lucasfilm has been purchased by Disney, both Lucas and Spielberg are back as executive producers.It starts with a de-aged Indiana Jones along with friend Basil Shaw battling the Nazis on the train to retrieve the holy Lance of Longinus. It turns out to be a fake but he has found half of the Archimedes' Dial.The de-aging is done well although the eyes do look a bit animated. Also some of the scenes are basically stunt doubles with a younger Harrison Ford mask.It then goes forward to New York 1969, Professor Jones is retiring as a lecturer and he lives alone in a crummy apartment. It is also the day of the homecoming parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts.Jones is visited by Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) his goddaughter and the daughter of Basil, she is also an archeologist but she wants money and glory. Helena also wants to know about what happened to the half of the Archimedes' Dial which is thought to be lost.Also after it is Astrophysicist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) who was there with Indiana Jones on that train back in 1944. Now he works for NASA, but he has always remained an unrepentant Nazi.Director James Mangold has tried to keep with the story beats of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom. A search for mythical artefact. Voller wants the dial as it may allow him to go back in time and change the course of Nazi history.As for what happens when the dial starts to work, I think it was a smart time travel move. A nod is owed to the Doctor Who story Blink.As for the movie, given the fact that big blockbuster action adventures roll around several times a month in peak moviegoing season. I enjoyed this. One last ride with Harrison Ford and some senseless fun.Mangold obviously tries to copy the Spielberg formula. David Koepp who is Spielberg's writing fixer is onboard. The one big negative was the movie was too long.","6/10"
"ProfGenki","31 August 2020","..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers.
I am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.
The level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.","8/10"

"providerssok","4 July 2023","The latest installment in the Indiana Jones series fails to capture the essence and thrill that characterized its predecessors. This film disappoints with its lackluster execution, missing the mark on delivering an engaging adventure filled with gripping action and captivating storytelling.One of the primary shortcomings lies in the convoluted plotline. The narrative feels forced and lacks the simplicity and cohesiveness that made previous films so enjoyable. The inclusion of certain elements and artifacts seems out of place within the established Indiana Jones universe, detracting from the historically grounded nature that fans have come to love.Furthermore, the characterization of the iconic Indiana Jones himself falls short. The once-charismatic and witty archaeologist, brought to life by a talented actor, is overshadowed by an uninspired script. The beloved charm and charisma that defined the character are sorely missed, leaving fans disconnected from the protagonist they have grown to adore.The film's pacing is also a letdown, with unnecessarily prolonged action sequences that fail to capture the same level of excitement as the iconic set pieces of earlier movies. The overreliance on CGI effects and green screen technology further detracts from the authenticity and immersion that fans have come to expect from an Indiana Jones film.Additionally, the introduction of new supporting characters feels forced and unconvincing. Their inclusion does little to enhance the story or establish meaningful relationships, lacking the chemistry and depth found in previous films.Overall, this latest Indiana Jones adventure falls short of the high standards set by its predecessors. Its convoluted plot, underdeveloped characterization, and excessive reliance on CGI make it a disappointing addition to the franchise. Fans may find brief moments of nostalgia, but ultimately, this film fails to live up to the legacy of the adventuring archaeologist, leaving viewers yearning for the excitement and magic of the earlier films.","8/10"
"psheehan78","25 November 2012","This is a three hour movie but you'll swear you were in the theater for at least 12. I don't normally mind long movies but this one was pretty slow and boring. My sister fell asleep for half of it but my brother and I were not as fortunate. There were some sporadic entertaining parts and the 3D had it's moments but that's no reason to torture yourself for the other 2 1/2 hours. Just when you think the movie is about to wrap up, the guy starts telling another story! I almost walked out right then and actually wish I did because the ending is what really made me feel cheated. *Spoiler* So you're telling me the entire story you just wasted my time with was a complete lie? I felt bad for the guy that was following him around all over the place listening to his BS for hours and hours. I think I would've probably punched him in the face. I have a history of missing the point of these artistic movies but I don't understand how lying about what happened when you got shipwrecked makes anyone closer to God.I'm going to use this technique on my girlfriend. Honey, I went to the store to buy you a gift when I was kidnapped by a unicorn that flew me to a magical island with perfume flowers and lipstick bushes. Then I killed the unicorn and escaped on a giant pterodactyl that scratched up my back and dropped me off just in time for breakfast.Oh, you don't like that story? How about, I went to the bar, got wasted and went home with some other chick last night?I've told you two stories that both result in me not coming home last night. Both stories end with me having a scratched back, lipstick on my face and neck, and smelling of perfume. Which story would you prefer? Do you believe in god now?","7/10"

This last chapter is being praised all over the internet, but I struggle to understand why : aside from the amazing special effects, there doesn't seem to be much left, I was actually waiting for it to end because I didn't feel engaged at all. Whenever there were apes on screen, I was honestly pretty annoyed, and only that one monologue by Woody Harrelson managed to wake me up a little.","10/10"
"pugpool10","2 June 2023","If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.","10/10"
"pugs1970","30 April 2019","If you go into this movie thinking that you're going to get an Infinity Wars part II I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed. I enjoyed the movie, but I was hoping for so much more, and yes, I know, when you go into a movie with high expectations the chances are that you're setting yourself up for disappointment, but the more I think about this movie the more I hate the direction it took.
Now..obvious mistakes aside (Capt America with the power of lightning?...really??...it was literally explained in Ragnarok) the way they destroyed some of the best characters was completely frustrating, Lebowski Thor?....Slimey Hulk?.......a Thanos that you couldn't empathise with even though you knew it was wrong?.....meh....
The thing is, once you introduce time travel into a movie you're going to spend the rest of your days wondering 'why didn't they just....' unless it's done really intelligently, unfortunately this falls very short of that mark, and as whole...when I think about the film now, it just feels like a bit of an over emotional fan film, an MCU scrapbook of nostalgia that despite being 3 hours long...still felt incredibly rushed.
The biggest moment in ten years of Marvel movies was 'The Snap' ...yet in Endgame you don't even get to see any of effect of reversing it??....apart from a phone call from Hawkeye's wife?....baffling.
Throughout most of this film I felt like I was watching a parody, it's something you still have to watch.....and you'll probably enjoy it, just as long as you don't think about it afterwards.","10/10"
"Puroo","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","10/10"
"purveshgholap","11 September 2019","War for the planet of the apes is the third installment to the trilogy, the previous two films have been amazing. Rise of the planet of the apes was pretty underrated for what it delivered, didn't got the enough recognition it deserved nonetheless it was a great watch. Dawn of the planet of the apes was a fantastic sequel it was pretty dark in its tone, however the story telling was on point and the characters were memorable. The first ape film which is rise was about ceaser character about his origin or where he belonged, the second ape film which was dawn is about ceaser leading the pack of apes, where humanity has gotten extinct due to their own hunger of power of science and technology, and third film focuses on ceaser's journey where he is dealing with the toughest time of his life, which will lead him either to his death or salvation.
War for the planet of the apes is an excellent third installment to what has become one of the greatest trilogy of all time, this movie is emotionally powerful. In this movie ceaser is the most broken, the most vulnerable and is also filled with lot of hatred, the guilt of losing the people he couldn't protect, his journey has been explored so perfectly where you see a great character development in him. Matt reeves has returned to direct the third installment, he did a great job with Dawn and has done a fabulous job with war.
This is one of the best visual story telling movie I've seen, the CGI of the apes has just gotten better over the years, in war the level of details in these characters is just fantastic, they look very photo realistic, the CGI has been done by some very talented people who deserves a pat on their shoulders, the cinematography is also brilliant as some of those shots look very beautiful.
Andy serkis has definitely given an Oscar worthy performance here, in previous two movies he was amazing, but Andy serkis has never been this good in any movie that he has ever worked in, his character is just so broken so deep, his performance really makes you feel sad about him and even the supporting cast gave very satisfying performance. In this movie we get introduced to two new characters that is mute girl child (her name is not mentioned because that's a spoiler) and bad ape. The little girl in this movie who was mute for the entire film had to relied on her expressions to give a good performance, and she was great in this movie some of her moments with ceaser and Maurice were adorable, in this very dark story telling movie some of these sweet moments were a great addition, and the character of bad ape could have been a problem as his character is comedic, but he was handled very well, and some of his funny scenes were a nice touch of humour and really added something to the movie.
However, this movie did a false marketing, making people believe that the movie will be action packed buff, with its title war for the planet of the apes, many people that it would be action packed extravaganza, but it wasn't. This movie does have some of the actions scenes, but most of them were just in the beginning of the film, after that the film a deal dramatic story visaul story telling movie, it didn't hinder my experience as the story building and the character development of this movie was so great that at some levels this movie even exceeded my expectations, but that's isn't the case with everyone, as some people I know were disappointed due to lack of war type action scenes.
All and all I think war for the planet of the apes is a beautiful film and really closes the trilogy in the best way possible","10/10"
"PyroSikTh","17 February 2023","I didn't dislike this movie, let me be clear. I had a good time with it, especially when talking about the villains, and while I felt more could've been done with the Quantum Realm itself, this was a fun and creative space opera world to explore. But Quantumania is a story riddled with holes (unlike one of its best side characters) and inconsistencies, and doesn't particularly add to the MCU as a whole either. For a movie deemed the most important for the next phase of the movies, it didn't have any long-lasting effects at all. It's nowhere near as fun as its predecessors (Luis is sorely missed), and too many of the characters are annoying or frustrating to watch (or barely present at all). And then there's the CG world that lacks any frame of reference, and some really bizarre editing decisions. I give Quantumania an enjoyable yet flawed entry into the MCU canon; 7/10. But yeah, it's the villains that save this movie.QyrosMovies.","2/10"
"PyroSikTh","18 July 2017","The first thing to make clear is that the marketing for War is slightly off. Just because it has ""War"" in the title, and the trailers are jam-packed full of grand action sequences, doesn't mean it's just a series of Ape v Human battles strung one after the other. In fact it's quite the opposite. There's a skirmish that opens the film, and the large-scale battle at the end (between two human factions), however the middle is more of a revenge tale with holocaust allegories thrown in. If you go into War expecting a full-on action movie, you'll be disappointed and bored, guarantee it. If you go into it as a fan of Rise and Dawn, you'll know that there's more to these movies.War picks up two years after the events of Dawn, with the apes on the run, and the human army mentioned at the end on their tail. As a new place to settle, far away from the military's grasp, has been found, the Apes plan a mass migration. Unfortunately things don't quite go to plan, and Caesar is cast on a journey of revenge, accompanied by franchise stalwarts Maurice and Rocket, as well new gorilla Luca.For a first in the series, and arguably a necessity this time around, War can also be pretty funny. The introduction of Bad Ape not only offers some strong hints as to where the franchise can go from here, but he's also used as comedic relief really well. He had the theatre in the laughter on a few occasions, but it never felt out of place or unnatural.It's not all perfect though. My biggest problem with the movie was the very last moments before the credits rolled. But another minor niggle I had was Caesar's speech. It was used sparingly and effectively in the first two movies, pointing out moments of significance and adding more weight to what was actually being said. In War though, he pretty much talks the whole time. With Koba gone, he was the only Ape left with extensive experience of human language, and so the only one that could talk. So why he talks to his apes almost all the time is beyond me. It reaches peak illogicality when he continues to talk to other apes while in stealth. Surely if you're trying to be quiet and sneaky, and can communicate with sign language, that would be the obvious form of communication you'd use, right? Apparently, Caesar's not as smart as he's meant to be.Visually War is at least on par, if not an improvement on the previous movies. With every passing year, the art of motion capture technology continues to advance and develop, and War is a fantastic demonstration of that. Caesar, Maurice, Rocket, Luca, Bad Ape, and every other primate featured is a massively impressive piece of work. They don't even look CGI'd at all, to the point where I swore they were using animatronics for some scenes (maybe they were, I honestly couldn't tell the difference). There's one moment in particular where we get a close-up of Maurice's face and his expression, and it's the most delicate, perfect marriage of acting performance and computer-generated imagery.On which note the acting in War is incredibly top-notch, maybe even the best of the series. Andy Serkis bows out of the role of Caeser with an incredibly conflicted, moving, and profound performance. You can see his struggle, his rage, his sadness in his face. And his body movements in Ape form are perfect. Karin Konoval's performance as Maurice is just as great as well, showing a tenderness and wisdom so synonymous with his character since Rise, but never really given too much focus. Steve Zahn deserves praise for managing Bad Ape's humorous moments with a seriousness of tragedy that helps the gags not feel out of place in a fundamentally serious and sombre movie. Woody Harrelson also owns the show as The Colonel, and his scenes opposite Serkis are tantalisingly good.The music I feel added a hell of a lot to War's charm as well. I've been disappointed with Michael Giacchino's work recently, as he kept turning in hugely dull and forgettable scores for his movies. The score he's written for War though is possibly the best score he's ever written. It's jam-packed full of emotional weight all by itself, emphasising every scene it's used in in the film itself. A certain recurring piano line is sure to have you welling up with tears before anything even happens, adding a sombre atmosphere to the whole movie. For his more bombastic pieces, he employs a lot of orchestral drums and percussion, along with woodwind instruments you might expect to hear in the original movies from the 60s or 70s. Often the score feels like a homage to those older movies all by itself, and it works fantastically. It's definitely the best score of the franchise, if not one of the top contenders for the whole year.War for the Planet of the Apes unfortunately doesn't shine a light on it's Reeves- predecessor - Dawn is still a masterclass for the franchise - but it's certainly a good follow-up that keeps up it's tone and narrative direction. It's more drama than it is war, but the two bookend action sequences are large and intense enough that they more than make up for it's slower middle. Not that the slower middle is a complaint. I feared it would devolve into a Return of the King-type trilogy closer where half the movie is just one massive battle sequence. Instead I was gifted with something much more emotional and intelligent. That said, it is the only one of the franchise so far that had moments I actively found frustrating. The very end being the movie's biggest offence. I give War a solid, yet imperfect 8/10.","2/10"

Somehow across the spider verse exceeds those.The great animation style that we witnessed in the first spider verse film, is expanded upon, with new characters and styles that adds to a film that sometimes feels and looks like art.The consstant shift between locations and different characters, creates a fun experience, that does not feel dragged out. Meanwhile Miles and Gwen work as exciting characters, while still having great chemistry between each other.This film is a masterpiece, and by far the best spider man film of all time, I would definitely recommend across the spider verse!","10/10"
"questl-18592","25 September 2023","Oh Marvel. I remember once when you were fun. You were appointment movie going. People clamored for the next movie and I would rush out to the theatre the first week to go and see it because I knew, I KNEW, that whatever you put on screen, it was going to be fun. It might not make me think too much, it might not evoke deep thought or emotion, but it'd be pure fun. Then came COVID and my faith was shaken. It's funny, because there was a line from Iron Man 2, ""If you make God bleed, then people will no longer believe in him."" Marvel, you're bleeding.Quantomania is... Fine. There were moments that were funny, but beyond that this movie was utter nonsense. There were no stakes, no sense of what was going on, if anything mattered, it didn't even try to... WHY WERE THERE PEOPLE DOWN THERE?! The only real saving graces here were in the actors. Rudd is as charming and funny as ever. Douglas had some amazing moments that were just really fun. And Majors. Wow. Great great job. I have questions as to how his powers shifted throughout the movie, but that's not him. He gave that character some serious gravitas and interest.For the time being, Marvel was still able to put enough fun in this movie to overwhelm all the stupid, but only just. Those margins are getting thinner and thinner. As someone who has loved these characters since childhood, long before the MCU was a thing, I really hope they sort themselves out because I would love to return to the days when these movies were just raw fun.","7/10"
"Quietb-1","20 July 2017","The title is a spoiler. The movie is a war movie between apes and the men who survived a virus and want to destroy the apes. It would have been a much shorter movie if they decided just to get along. The movie is too long and there're are just too many battle scenes. Then it becomes a slave issue movie, a prison camp escape movie, and even a ""Heart of Darkness"" rogue military officer rip off.Going in you know what to expect and if you went in you can figure out who won. Technically the movie looks great. It should be seen in a theater with a big screen and strong sound. Without disclosing the ending, they will find a way to bring Caesar back.","2/10"
"Quietb-1","21 November 2012","Ang Lee makes good looking movies. Here again, he is meticulous in his craft and it shows on the screen.The problem with the Life of Pi is it starts too soon and ends too late. Because it is a story in flash back you know PI survives. If you have seen a trailer you know the movie should start with a great ship wreck scene. It takes to long to get there. End after the rescue. That interesting shaggy dog story from the hospital bed that was heard, not seen, was not needed and not cinematic. The movie looks and sounds good but it is redundant. How many storms at sea are enough? The movie might have trouble finding an audience. It looks like a family movie, but it is too violent and intense for younger children. If you go to see it, take your lead from the tiger. When the tiger leaves, you should too.","10/10"
"quiqueperezsoler","31 May 2023","The writers behind the Spiderverse movies are some of the best of our time. Not only do they know how to craft a unique, high-staked, deeply personal and riveting story, but their respect for the legacy of Spider-Man is beyond perfect.And that's all it takes, folks. For everyone and anyone whose working on preestablished franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, DC...), who want to follow up the adventures or stories in a robustly-built universe, all you need is to ""read up"". To understand what makes it work and use those strengths to your advantage.This movie is one of the best Spider-man stories I have ever seen. It's unlike any other told in the comics and movies, it's fresh, provocative (in the good way) and all out bonkers. Needless to say, the animation is top notch. I mean, Sony Animation Studios has developed into a powerhouse of stylised animation. It already showed in the trailers, but if you liked the different styles used in the animation of each spiderperson from other universe, you are going to have a fieldtrip with this one.Almost everything works in this movie, the comedy, the set pieces, the world-building, the emotional and dramatic moments. It's simply top tier cinema, not animated cinema alone, but overall cinema. The romantic tension, the new character's personalities and relationships, it's all around perfect, I would not change a thing.There's so many pros that I don't think I can put into words the amount of things this movie does right. The long action scenes, animation style, sound design and soundtrack, the script, the characterisation of old and new spider people. I have only praises for this movie. But the biggest one is what I said previously, the respect and understanding of the mythos and lore of Spider-man is what saves this movie for the bigger fans. Because Spider-man is not a hard story to adapt, but there's a lot of good stuff in it and the way the writters play with preestablished media and introducing new media to the people while not being too much to handle for the audience is brilliant.There're references for everyone, for those who saw only the movies, or the shows, or the games, or the tv shows, or the comics. I don't want to jump into spoilers, I just want to point out all the good qualities this movie has, that carries from the previous and some which are improved and amped to the max.Just the ambition of the story they are trying to tell here already surpases any and all expectations. I whole-heartedly believe they are breaking grounds here and they are changing the way the Spider-man universe works and I applaud their fantastic work. I hope the next one fulfills the catharsis that left me wanting more after the credits roled in this one.If anything, and I mean very mildly ruined the experience for me, that is, I lowered from a 10/10 to a 9/10, was two aspects that bugged me more than I expected. One of them is, you can tell this movie was divided in two while you watch it: the pacing is a bit slow in some scenes, action scenes that drag just a bit too much some times or emotional scenes that go on when all that was meant to be said was done. And the other aspect is, and this may be a bit spoilery, so if you don't wanna read more NOW IS THE TIME NOT TO READ MORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED:I think the prologue and recap of the previous movie at the beginning of this one wasn't too.. right. It threw me off a bit just because they went on for too long, like they tried to flesh out the background story of someone and, despite how this comes back full circle in the end, it just carries on and on it's a bit too long before we get to where everyone is. Also, and this is last spoilery thing, I feel there's a bit of a flaw of continuity when Gwen ""comes back to see Miles"", like between the ending of the previous movie, and this one. They didn't connect it too well I think (ahem, Miles seems different).","2/10"

however, one also could not deny that the core content is recycled, there are no new characters, no new plots, once again, it is merely freiza and broly and gogeta even if it is one of the rarest to appear, yet again, this recycled content is put in presented excellently and in a nearly perfect way that covered the dull fact of its repeatedness and expectedness,

"r_chad_ellis","22 January 2024","Rumor has it that the script was written on a bet for what movie audiences would buy for a story line.Rumor also has it has it the dialogue was contributed by Miss Cotswold's 4th grade class at Taylor Elementary School in Des Moines, IA.Rumor also has it beekeepers with the American Beekeeping Federation in Mooresville, IN, protested the opening for its depiction of bee keepers as middle-aged bald actors forced to make the same movie over and again for 2 decades.At 1hr 24min Jason Statham's character glares to the right. All other glares are to the left. No other facial expression is ever detected. This is what referred to as his ""range"".The extras for the fight scenes were provided by the Marcel Marceau School of Walking-In-the-Wind Mimes.Was there a good takeaway? Absolutely. I chose the small popcorn at the theatre so I wasn't sick when I ate the whole bag before the 22 opening previews finished.","1/10"
"r96sk","1 February 2024","I'm conflicted about 'The Beekeeper'.On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. On the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term shudder) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.I'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.","8/10"
"r96sk","15 March 2023","A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M. O. D. O. K. Is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.","7/10"
"r96sk","21 February 2022","'War for the Planet of the Apes' wraps up a great trilogy strongly.I enjoyed this installment just as much as its two predecessors, all three films are just supremely entertaining and are very well put together. Caesar is a terrific character and continues to look fantastic in this; the special effects are top notch, even the way the apes are shown in shot is expertly done. The additions of Bad Ape and Nova are neat, too.I'd personally rank it above 'Dawn' but below 'Rise', though there isn't much between them at all. Intrigued to see where they go with the proposed spin-off(s).","3/10"
"r96sk","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","1/10"
"r96sk","24 October 2023","Feels needless, but 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' still gave me suitable entertainment.I'd personally rank it higher than 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', though to be honest I feel similarly about all five films from this franchise - evidently, given I've rated them all 7/10. I wasn't someone who grew up with this series and when I finally did watch it well over three years ago I didn't connect to them massively, so this fifth installment isn't too far adrift from the original trilogy. If this was much shorter, I may have even liked this more if I'm to be truthful.So yeah, I found the run time to be excessive. It's actually paced relatively well, I'm just not convinced the story itself needed to be told over almost two and a half hours. There is good action adventure in this and the music is done nicely, that theme even gives me goosebumps despite my lack of strong affection for the films.Cast-wise, it's positive. I'm not that much of a fan of Harrison Ford if I'm honest, don't get me wrong I have literally zero against the guy either but from this franchise and that certain other space franchise (I forget the name...) he has never stood out to me strangely. In these and those, I prefer others. Admittedly, I wanna check out his other work away from these sorta flicks. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is very good, as is Mads Mikkelsen. Ethann Isidore and Boyd Holbrook play their parts too.Overall, it's worth watching. The opening and closing sequences are my favourite bits.","7/10"

A lot of action and gore was there, which I liked.Could have been a real winner... but they failed to execute, by just making another kill, dismember shock value movie.Stratham did his usual stuff, which never disappoints, but the main female characters choices where silly, the kiwi guy was laughable (and I am a kiwi).

"radursm","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.
I quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the ""Guardians of Galaxy""?","1/10"
"ragnor-77708","6 February 2024","I usually really enjoy Jason Statham films. The Crank movies were fun. The Transporter movies were fun. And while he's been in a few stinkers, most of his movies, while over-the-top, are entertaining.The Beekeeper is a bad movie. The plot is atrocious, the dialog is bad and the acting is some of the worst I've sat through in a long while. Jason was still Jason, but the rest? Bad.The portrayal of government agencies and agents was laughable. Tell your boss at the FBI Jason the Beekeeper is chasing down bad guys, and within 15 seconds he's heard enough and you get a blank check. Show up at POTUS' retreat, introduce yourself as an agent with the ""Federal Bureau of something or other"" and get waved through. Uh huh.Jason the Beekeeper was able to mow through thugs, Police Officers, SWAT officers, FBI Agents, SEALS, Delta, etc with no difficulty, not even a scratch. But when a one-legged, overweight Aussie with lot's of scary tats shows up, he's the one that gives Jason the Beekeeper trouble? Silly. Worst Statham movie yet.","7/10"

I'd sat through it and concluded this for myself .What a swizz .I felt like I did at the end of Lost .Sort of- well what the hell was that about ! started off good but descended into a mess . The main character in it to me seemed like an idiot who didn't learn from his mistakes .Fleeing up to the deck in the midst of a flipping storm and leaving the deck door wide open .Ripping the cover from the tiger on the boat so he could share his trippy sky storm moment and hence losing his supplies .You wanted to throttle him . Then to hear at the end it had all been a euphemism for a horrible experience , I was so annoyed . How did this film get so much hype ? it wasn't a feel good movie after all .The poor animals , the depressing truth at the end and how the hell someone was supposed to find God of any kind at the end of this long lie ?

It most certainly could have. But being the cynical (and critical) a-hole that I am.. Sorry!I'd like to start out that my girlfriend went with me completely voluntarily (nope) and enjoyed herself very much (that part IS true!).The reason that this movie is a 9 out of 10 is just me acting out against Akira for allowing some of the, what I like to call: dragonball super design work. Although dragonball super has made LEAPS when it comes down to designing it still has its scenes where you just wonder; WHY!?SAME HERE. Part of the CGI was a completely different style and made scenes look messy because it did not incorporate with the designing. Some scenes just had bad designing all together. WHY would you let that happen, Akira?It can't be money. I've seen better scenes in other animes with not even half the budget. If you're going to make a masterpiece, AND THIS MOVIE IS. You might as well go the extra mile a make sure everything is spot on!What I loved was the fact that they made Broly so vulnerable! He came to earth not even wanting to fight, not even being able to go super saiyan. And during each fight he just reaches level after level after level..Loved the saiyan prequel.. Loved that Vegeta finally got some decent recognition.. Loved the fights.. If I could give a 9,5 I would. It, it just.. the small details in designing! WHY AKIRA.","8/10"
"ramesh-khanna","23 November 2012","Astounding movie experience!! Gripping story line that keeps you involved, and at the same time is simple and thought provoking. You start becoming / living the life of Pi as the film progresses and that is the real achievement of the movie. You are not a passive movie audience anymore.Most of you may not be aware, but ""Life of Pi"" is loosely based on the TRUE STORY of a person who survived a shipwreck along with a Jaguar. Yann Martel's 2001 Book ""Life of Pi"" on which the movie is based upon was in-turn based on Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella ""Max and the Cats"", which in-turn was based on a true story.The quality of the 3D graphics are so real that few scenes may scare the children, but this is too good a movie to skip just because of this fact.

That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange?

"rannynm","17 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania manages to clench the undying thirst for the unknown within the Marvel Cinematic Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Universe, yet introduces so much that it doesn't really introduce anything at all. While being carried on the back of a strong performance by Jonathan Majors, Ant-Man: Quantumania is strictly a setup film, which is somewhat pointless, because it sets up what Marvel fans already know. Regardless of leaving little to no impact, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's visuals are where it shines, literally and figuratively. In a film that takes place almost entirely in a CGI world, Marvel creates its own Star Wars and perfects every minute computer generated detail.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, with the entire world rehabilitating, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicks off (or flies off, because... ants). The audience sees the new luxurious life of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) - Hero, father and self-proclaimed ""author."" The story quickly introduces the new struggle Scott has for raising his newly teenage daughter, Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). When Cassie reveals she has been tampering with Quantum Realm technology, it's too late. The whole Ant-Man crew gets shrunken down into the Quantum Realm (a subatomic world beneath Earth). The rest of the story follows the whole family venturing to find a way out of the realm, while Kang the Conqueror hunts them relentlessly.For the past couple years, Marvel has had major controversy regarding their CGI and VFX artists (mainly with their Disney+ shows). At least for Ant-Man: Quantumania, they seem to be back on track, or starting to be. The images are impeccable and matched with a strong score; the auditory and visual experience is automatically enhanced. IMAX is the correct way to view the film. Despite the irrelevant plot, Jonathan Majors conquers the show. He emphasizes the true power of Kang, with a blood-curdling scream that'll make sure he is thought about well after the credits roll. Although, the film fails to utilize him to the extent they could have, leaving the audience wanting more, and not in a positive way.Like all the other films put through the Marvel formula, this film does not disappoint with its fair share of comedy, foul language and violence. When dealing with a villain known for annihilating entire worlds and timelines, of course the audience will see a lot more than a simple punch thrown on the big screen. In terms of gore however, it does not go there to a large extent. Underneath the antics, the story pairs with a large theme of family, and teaches the moral that love of all kinds always perseveres.I give Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. You can find Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theatres on February 17, 2023. Make sure to check it out! By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!","6/10"

That said, nothing beats seeing this character back in the saddle, riding off into the sunset in search of the next great artifact.The movie opens in 1969 -- we've landed on the moon, but Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has landed a job as a professor at a sleepy university in New York. The adventure begins when his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) offers him a chance to find a dial from ancient times that is rumored to have extraordinary capabilities. Indy soon discovers he's not the only one in search of the dial. A foe from Indy's past is on the trail with a posse of armed, dangerous associates and he wants to use the dial to rewind time and undo the events of World War II in the Nazi's favor. Indy and Helena's quest for a relic becomes a globe-trotting mission to stop the dial from being used for evil.It's a winning celebration of all things Indiana Jones, the character, Harrison Ford's performance, the movies, and a reminder of why we love them. When the movie turns its focus away from honoring the past and instead tells a whole new Indy adventure, that's where it gets really good. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starts with a thud. We see a flashback featuring a digitally de-aged Harrison Ford as a younger Indy in his first brush with the titular Dial, aided by an anxious professor (Toby Jones). It sets up the fabric of the story ahead, but the de-aging effect doesn't work like it needs to. It immediately creates a distance between us and the adventurer we're here to see. It's disquieting to see Indiana Jones not as we've known him for five movies now, but as a manipulated, augmented version of himself. A large portion of the rest of the movie suffers from the same flaws -- in honoring the franchise's past it feels like it keeps doing things we've seen before. In the final stretch, though, it does something I've never seen these movies do before, more specifically, somewhere Indy has never ventured.There isn't a lesson per se to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny but all stories that deal with time and its manipulation remind us that we have to try to be happy where we are, rather than live in the past. If you've seen an Indiana Jones movie, you know that faces can get melted off or hearts pulled out in the pursuit of treasure, be warned that there is frequent violence and some profanity.I give Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

"rannynm","8 January 2013","This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker. Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual. I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer). A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but thru it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination. Believe the unbelievable and see the amazing adventure in Life of Pi, it triumphs into theaters on November 21. by Brianna Hope Beaton, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","9/10"
"rasmusjonsson-73138","19 April 2023","I'm beyond tired of everyone having suits. What's even the point of our heroes if literally everyone can do the same thing?Also don't get me started on genius kids that can just build the coolest things ever in their basements, the MCU has like 10 of them at this point.What's even the point of Iron Man and Ant-Man and even the Black Panther? Literally anyone can just do the same if you just give them a suit (and in Black Panther's case the flower too).Nah, I'm seriously annoyed at this point.

Let me tell you this, I was so captivated by the storyline, action, the dramatic and cinematic effects. It was an absolute 10/10 for me. This entire movie, on it's entirety left me with an amazing feeling. I even clapped all by myself in movies. You gotta watch it in cinemas or your home theatre with proper sound effects coz god knows there are lots of them :) well done the sound team x holly molly that was some nice sound effects, every sound was on point for me. Thank you love to work with you guys one day soon.The masterful action choreography holly mother of doctor who haha I was pinned to my seat the minute an action scene would start. I simply was too captivated to move, or drink or reach for my phone, and I'm a insta freak hahaha
Thank you all the crew, I know how hard you must've worked on this masterpiece. Wow love you. The amazing cast, thank you for years of hard work and living on macaroni and cheese just to get this point. I salute you.Director, producers, writers... everyone, up to the drivers that moved the crew around, upto the cleaners who cleaned the set ready for the next day I love you. What an amazing creation. Thank you.","10/10"
"raulfaust","9 March 2014","The summary is the phrase that made me wanna see this picture. It's been written in the movie's cover, and considering I read good reviews about it everywhere, I decided renting it. Many people put this movie in the same level as modern classics like ""Titanic"", and I think I disagree with them. The first half of the movie is completely involving, thanks to a good directing, scenario and performances. I really entered the Indian ambient and recognized beauty in everything of their culture-- and I constantly pictured young Pi as Rajesh from ""The Big Bang Theory"". The family concerns are universal and convincing, which is a good step in the story: something everyone can be related to. However, the boat scenes in which Pi has to live with the tiger didn't impress me that much. Firstly, due to the fact that the tiger felt very fake, and anyone could easily notice it was pure CGI. In fact, every animal in the ark felt computerized. Secondly, because they took too long. The ending, on the other hand, has a beautiful message about what really happened, and it doesn't let you know which of Pi's stories was the real one. Either way, the doubt is intelligent and provoking, so you'll not have a clichéd outcome. In my opinion, it doesn't beat up movies like ""Titanic"" and ""The Green Mile"", but it's a good entertainment with some new ideas.","8/10"

"ravi2445","12 May 2019","Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.

"rcowles0324","17 July 2017","""War"" is a difficult movie to review, and honestly, there's not a lot to say about it. After any given movie is finished, and my companion and I walk out of the theater, we're usually discussing the movie (good or bad). This one we didn't. And honestly, by the time we drove home, it didn't matter and I didn't care. The movie was, overall, that forgettable.From a cinematography, CGI, and FX standpoint, War is fine. Maybe even excellent. But then, it's 2017. I expect that in sci-fi or fantasy movies. There are no ground breaking visuals in the movie. The main characters are fleshed out fairly well, although the script (and director) fall into a completely unnecessary Jar-Jar Binks comedic character trap with one of the leads. The pacing of the film is slow. I don't mind a long picture if the content and pacing justify the length - which doesn't happen in War. And I shouldn't come out of a monkey movie that on one level is so very depressing I wanted to slit my wrists. There were plot holes galore, only about 20 minutes of real action, and like I said earlier, it was instantly forgettable. War is supposed to be (I guess) a movie that makes you think, but in reality, it's a schizophrenic mess with good optics. I would not watch it twice.","3/10"
"rcuttill","19 February 2023","We go down into the quantum world and enter planet cgi. Apart from the actors everything is CGI. There are strange creatures and landscapes. There are people who for the most part are similar to human, body, 2 arms, 2 legs etc. But with various different heads. There's no exposition of where everything came from so it's just the quantum realm and you have to accept it. It's kind of true for a lot of films these days but it's just such a surprise which makes it noticeable.The plot is acceptable and the villain is great. He's definitely menacing. They're so confident of him they say he'll be back.So enjoy. Ant-man and the wasp will win but they left a let out for a sequel.","5/10"
"realmuthaf","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","9/10"
"realskidrow","21 January 2024","Embark on a thrilling escapade with Jason Statham's latest cinematic triumph! This exceptional action film skillfully intertwines the elements of real-life challenges with the flair of movie magic, presenting an enthralling tale that dives into the world of battling con artists and seemingly invincible adversaries that lurk in our day-to-day life. The beauty of this film lies in its straightforward plot, which paves the way for exhilarating and well-choreographed combat scenes, ensuring you're glued to your seat in anticipation. Statham, in his element, delivers a performance that cements his position as the quintessential action hero. His portrayal is both gripping and authentic, adding a layer of intensity to every scene. This movie isn't just about the action; it's a journey into the depths of strategy and resilience against formidable opponents. It's a visual spectacle that combines heart-stopping action with a narrative that resonates with anyone who enjoys a story of overcoming the odds. A must-watch for those who appreciate intense storytelling, breathtaking fight choreography, and the sheer adrenaline rush of action-packed cinema!","7/10"
"rebecca-ry","10 January 2013","'Life of Pi' is a story about a young man stranded on a boat in the middle of the Pacific with a tiger after the ship carrying his family and their zoo sinks. Directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), this is a spectacular film with a lot of great qualities.There's pretty much just one actor in this; Suraj Sharma makes a great debut here and I really hope his career takes off after this despite not being nominated for an Oscar unfortunately. It must be challenging being the only actor on-screen for 90% of the film with no one to converse with except a CGI tiger- Sharma handles this well though and his performance is thoroughly entertaining. Irfan Khan doesn't have much screen time but he gives a powerful performance, particularly in the last scene. Rafe Spall is a bit disappointing; he doesn't show any emotion in crucial scenes and he can take away the power and quality of a scene because of this. The exact opposite of an actors' job!I am opposed to 3D in cinema and therefore chose to see this in traditional, 'boring' 2D. Visually, it is still spectacular despite it being advertised as a film made for 3D (doesn't every 3D films' advertising campaign argue this?). The CGI animals – excluding the tiger – can look obviously fake and tacky at times which can be a bit off- putting but this is very brief. The night sequences are over the top and unrealistic but are beautiful and do somehow suit the film – Ang Lee has done well in creating the setting.Overall, this is an excellent film which is sure to do well at the Oscars. It's not really similar to any of Ang Lee's other works but it is a great film to watch and is expertly made. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the book so I can't tell if it is any better but, from what I do know about the book, I think this film tries to stay as close to it as possible.","9/10"

"Red_Identity","30 November 2012","Let's get this out of the way. I did not see this in 3-D, so I will not talk about how amazing the 3-D was. In that respect, perhaps I am able to judge the film in its own right. The story here isn't anything too different. We've had survival stories of this kind before. The film is also told as one man's recollection, and I always have a problem with this technique. It always sort of drags the film down, because instead of you being immersed in the actual story being told, films always do some back-and-forths with the story and the character recollecting the story. This film is no exception, and it kinda falls into that same trap of cheese and over-sentimentality at times. This isn't a subtle film in any way, and it's more obvious in the present scenes.Getting that out of the way, this is a truly beautiful film in every respect. The message is clear, but powerful, and on a visual level this is masterful. The cinematography isn't just brilliant because the visual imagery is brilliant (and many times that's all people think of cinematography as being) but because the sweeping scope of the photography and the many different shots create a fantastically vivid and dreamy world. Even in it's most languid scenes there's a technical mastery here not present in most films. The strongest section of the film is Pi at sea no doubt, and it's virtually perfect. However, the last 10 or 15 minutes once again cross the line where some of it just comes across corny. But I liked the purpose of where the film headed, and what the ending was for, I just wish Lee and the script hadn't hit it with so much on-the-point sentimentality.But overall, flaws and all, this is a truly fantastic film, and strongly recommended.","9/10"

"redwoodsteve","4 February 2024","This has to be one of Stathams worst films. Besides him, and one or two others, most of the actors seem to have been chosen in a box ticking exercise. The plot and acting is appalling, with the main emphasis on killing as many people as possible in a John Wick 3, type of movie. Having Potus as the head of the large criminal organisation The Beekeeper is trying to eradicate, has to be from someone with little respect of the real world or common sense and then, top it off, having the 20 year old son of Potus be the mastermind behind his mother's empire is mind boggling.

"reelreviewsandrecommendations","17 July 2023","It is 1944 and adventuring archaeologist Indiana Jones is in a familiar predicament: the Nazis have caught him attempting to scupper their nefarious plans. After breaking free of their vile clutches, Jones and his accomplice Basil Shaw discover the fascists have found the Antikythera mechanism, a device created by Archimedes that supposedly reveals time fissures. Jones escapes, foils the enemy's schemes and steals the mechanism- seemingly putting the matter to bed. Some 25 years later, however, Jones is thrust back into action when his goddaughter Helena comes looking for the Antikythera; with an underground group of die-hard Nazis on her tail. Will Jones and Helena manage to save the day before time runs out?Directed by James Mangold and written alongside Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an uneven sendoff to one of the greatest characters in film history, that all too often feels like it came from the 'paint by numbers' school of filmmaking. Mangold tries throughout to recapture the magic of the original trilogy of Jones pictures, and occasionally succeeds; such as in the thrilling opening set in 1944, or a touching reunion between Indy and his estranged love at the end of the film. Furthermore, it is consistently enjoyable watching Harrison Ford on screen as Indy once more, even if he is a more downcast fellow this time; and the odd reference to adventures past is sure to make fans of the series grin from ear to ear.However, the narrative is weak, the characterization of secondary characters is scant at best and- weirdly- at times it seems as if Indy is the sidekick in his own film. Helena Shaw, from the moment she comes on screen, is treated as the real star of the show, despite her being a decidedly unlikable lady. A spoiled and arrogant heiress, she is constantly rude and dismissive of Indy, when she isn't being reckless and impulsive, putting herself and others in danger for her own selfish motives. As written, the character has little to no respect for history or culture, seeing everything as a means to an end. She contrasts starkly with Indy, whose humble respect for his profession and legacy endears him to audiences. Helena, on the other hand, is a self-centered cad, who tries to upstage our hero at every turn. Why Mangold thought she should be made the (arguable) central character when this is Indy's last outing is beyond comprehension, not to mention being irritating and disrespectful to a cinematic legend.Alas, Mangold's poor characterization isn't confined to her alone. 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' not only provides us with a discount Short Round in the form of Helena's associate Teddy- a kid more irritating than mischievous- but a discount Major Toht too, in the form of Professor Voller- a Nazi scientist so generic even the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen can't make him interesting. Neither of these new iterations of old characters are very compelling, nor well rounded; and their inclusion in the film feels like a desperate attempt to out-do and re-create times gone by. Furthermore, the few familiar faces that occasionally pop up feel shoehorned into the plot, and Voller's troupe of henchmen are bland and forgettable.Unfortunately, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' contains underwhelming visuals as well, which look cheap compared to the likes of 'Raiders' or 'The Last Crusade.' Much like with the previous 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', there is a phony digital sheen to everything on screen that takes one out of the movie completely, and the questionable CGI is jarring throughout. Comparing the first three movies with the last two, it seems digital processes don't fit an Indiana Jones vehicle, they are the kind of epics that demand to be shot on film with practical effects. Moreover, the exaggerated effects and artificiality of proceedings hamper whatever realism Mangold was trying to foster with his downbeat narrative and allusions to real world history.The main problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' though, is its lack of originality or charm, which the previous films- well, the first three, anyway- had in spades. Mangold seems content to rely on recycled tropes and clichés to forward the story, making this adventure feel like familiar ground instead of fresh fun. The film uses the similar formula of Nazis, ancient artifacts, exotic locations and supernatural elements that we have seen before, but without the wit, creativity and excitement that made them memorable; meaning this iteration of Indy comes as more of a whimper than a bang.Are there some elements deserving of praise in the film? Of course. Harrison Ford is consistently excellent and engaging as Indy, carrying the adventure squarely on his shoulders with his usual ease and charm. Furthermore, John Williams' epic score is stirring and- though her character is unlikable- Phoebe Waller-Bridge brings a nice blend of snark and enthusiasm to proceedings, sharing a good chemistry with Ford. Had they a better script to work with- and if Mangold's characterization wasn't so one-dimensional- they might have made a memorable duo. Additionally, the action is generally well realized- though tends towards the overblown- and there are moments and batches of dialogue that'll have fans of the series entertained, even if they are a bit few and far between.However, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' just isn't great. As an adventure movie, it is too downbeat, and as a final entry in a fantastic series, it is too weak narratively to make much impact. Though it makes for a better overall package than 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' it's not by much. The character of Helena Shaw is hard to warm to, the villains are forgettable and the visuals are underwhelming. In short, Indy, Ford and the fans deserved a better movie than 'The Dial of Destiny,' a muddled misadventure proving that time waits for no man; not even Indiana Jones.","6/10"
"regula1","13 July 2017","Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar.There's no getting around the power of his performance in this, the conclusion of the prequel Apes trilogy of films. In Rise, he portrayed the character of Caesar as a fast-maturing ape who was learning to grapple with his human side. In Dawn, we say that humanity firmly take hold after what was left of his peaceful ape habits began to fade.Now, in War, like Darth Vader, his goodness is in constant battle with his darker side, and the result is at times chilling but also heart- warming to see the good shine through once again.This Apes film is unique in the prequel trilogy as it mostly centers on the plight of the apes rather than the humans. In the previous two, we saw humanity as being on the short stick of its own arrogance, and the survivors learned to co-exist.Now, humans are shown through the lens of warriors only, specifically that of the Colonel played by Woody Harrelson. While his subordinates get the obligatory expendable-soldier treatment, the Colonel is a far more complex character who, while you condemn his actions, you understand his motivations, truly the kind of villain that good writing is capable of bringing to the screen.On the Apes side, with the exception of a couple of expendable characters with little to say about them, all of the characters we are introduced to are well fleshed-out and have interactions that contribute to the plot without needless exposition, the way it should be done.If there are any faults to this film, aside from its length, which by the end did start to feel it once the action ended, there were the references to the original Planet of the Apes. Up front, there are three obvious ones, and of these two are very in-your-face and after the initial reference are said again and again to point it is distracting, but in a movie such as this these are minor gripes.The original sequels to the original Planet of the Apes were less than stellar, but this capping-off of this prequel trilogy is up there as almost matching the quality of the original, sure to be remembered as a classic in the years to come.","10/10"
"rehmankhilji","2 September 2023","I was really surprised by the bad reviews of this particular sequel and all the comments from haters. Perhaps the group of people who didn't enjoy it aren't the ones who have been following it from the start, can't connect with the movie, its theme, or the emotions it evokes. For instance, ""Indy.""As for the movie, I really liked the Crystal Skull part, although Spielberg's fascination with aliens went a little too far for me.The best way to enjoy the movie more is to not read the reviews, just watch it if you're an Indiana Jones fan.

"rehmankhilji","4 February 2024","Upon encountering the name David Ayer as the director, alongside Jason Statham in a production bearing a promising title, I anticipated a satisfying full on action movie experience. However, akin to the recurrent pattern observed in Statham's previous films, this one, albeit marginally superior, failed to meet expectations.Initially, the director presents a character engaged in beekeeping, yet the portrayal lacks authenticity by sparing only a meager 100 bees and possessing a minimal number of hives, if not fewer than a dozen.The film's execution is notably deficient across numerous scenes, prompting a sense of incredulity and frustration. Numerous lapses in coherence and logic pervade the narrative, leaving the viewer bewildered and questioning the purpose of the cinematic endeavor.The prevalence of clumsy mistakes becomes evident within the initial minutes, rendering the movie entirely nonsensical in its unfolding. Emmy Raver-Lampman's casting in a particular role remains questionable, lacking a discernible rationale.In summation, refraining from viewing this production does not entail a significant loss, as it fails to deliver any substantial content of note.","3/10"

Now he rides away from it on a horse.For the rest of the movie he's basically being lead around by Helena, who is the main focus here. If you digitally removed Indiana from the movie, it'd basically be the same movie.I completely believe that the ending was changed, and that Helena was meant to be the hero going forward. Just another Kathy Kennedy surrogate. Yawn.","9/10"
"Reno-Rangan","22 November 2012","Well, one of most expected movie of 2012 by me. It was not a colorful visual movie like 'Avatar' which was bluish Or 'Hugo' which was orangish except in few scenes that too come in night shot though IMO you should not compare it with above two. Many part of 3D sequences were just awesome.It could have been more violent and sentimental story that ever told on this theme but not, the director cleverly blended the humor with character emotions very nicely, thats why it was just ratted PG where children are allowed with their parents approval, but it is common for them to see an animal to kill another in Animal Planet, so its not a big deal i think. The CGI animal(s) were looked so clean and good.I must say the movie don't offer what you expect from its trailer, in movie it was totally different than any movie in the world except Waterworld + Cast Away + Castle in the Sky = Life Of Pi, i am not comparing it to other 3 but saying got similarity in some parts.I did not like the end much, I mean the way it ended was not proper, I thought it still had something to go far away then realized it happen only in commercial movies.My question is can this movie do good business which got no big names and cast!? Indian cast, Taiwan's talent, American product and a great effort of various technicians from around the world is equal to LIFE OF PI in Pacific ocean over 227 days. Hoping it gonna grab couple of awards in Academy award. Worth watching it in 3D, Someday in future you can say that i was in there when it came out when it called epic like what we call some of classical movies today.You could see better and beautiful India in beginning few Minutes than any Hollywood movie which deal on Indian subject. people from in and around Pondicherry can feel proud, why not whole Indians can. The images from the movie will remain in our eyes for some time even after you left the cinema hall specially may be you won't forget the name Richard Parker.And now i go for 9 outa 10 saying must see specially we Indian coz we cant make movie like this at least for right now in our own but we can watch this western piece of Indian art carved Ang Lee.There is a chance it gonna replace 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as his (Ang Lee's) best, i said may be so lets see. Might be i am little excited for seeing it in preview show lets see what happens later days and what others say.9½/10","5/10"
"restlesssheep","21 January 2019","It's a movie that handles deep themes but ignores exploring those themes. SPOILERS.The story is,in the base level, about goku and vegeta's fight against Broly.The good thing about the movie is it's action. it's obvious that no pennies were spared in making of the movie.The movie fails at it's story. Broly was raised by his father for revenge. Two soldiers took pity on him and wants to make him a free man. This sets up a recurring theme in the movie. The theme of brain washing. This theme even though touched is utterly ignored in favor of quickly going to the fighting scenes.The fighting scenes themselves are set up in a horrible way too. The ""epic fight"" starts with no warning. It starts with Broly walking in and the fight starting. The lack of ANY set up of the fight is a sight to behold.I would love to say something more but I can't, because this movie HAS NO STORY. It tries to tackle a heavy subject which deserves a story far longer than 1 Hour 44 minutes and far more than three people punching each other.","10/10"
"RetroRick","3 August 2019","Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future","10/10"
"Reviews_of_the_Dead","22 June 2023","This was another of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'll be honest, I've been checked out of the last ones as it feels like they are just introducing characters and not progressing to a major story. That is until this one. What I will say though is that I've enjoyed my time. It just hasn't inspired me to want to continue watching the MCU output. Something else is that Ant-Man and The Wasp make fun movies, especially since I like Paul Rudd.Now for this one, we are after the events of Endgame. Life has gone back to semi-normal. Scott Lang (Rudd) is happy with Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). They have a makeshift family with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton). Hank is working with Cassie who wants to know more about the Quantum Realm. Janet doesn't want to talk about it and is closed off there. Cassie is also getting into trouble as she is socially conscious.Cassie created a device that can search the Quantum Realm. This gets this group into trouble as they get sucked in. It is now that Janet reveals what she did when she was trapped there. She met someone else in a similar situation. She helped them, but she saw what was in their heart. Also, what their plan is if they ever get out. This character is from the future and named Kang (Jonathan Majors). He is behind the Langs, Van Dyne and Hank getting sucked into the Quantum Realm.That should recap and get you up to speed with what this movie is doing. What I'm glad about is that we finally get who our next major villain to replace Thanos, Kang the Conqueror. I don't know much about this guy. What I do know is that it makes people excited. This seems like it fits since Kang is a time traveler who is destroying other timelines in the multiverse. I'm excited to see where things will go now.Outside of introducing this villain, this was my least favorite of the Ant-Man movies. It isn't the acting. Rudd is solid along with Lilly, Douglas, Pfeiffer, Majors and Newton. If anything, Rudd doesn't bring as much humor as normal. We get back Corey Stoll in an odd role. I love that they used M. O. D. O. K. The execution on screen though wasn't great. We also got a cameo from Bill Murray which was wild. I also liked Katy M. O'Brian, William Jackson Harper and the voice of David Dastmalchian. The acting is solid, but it takes a backseat to the action and effects.I'll then finish this out with the filmmaking. What I'll give credit to here is creating this fictional and smaller world of the Quantum Realm. There is limitless things that can be done here. I'll also credit the effects. This is CGI heavy, but they do look good thanks to the Disney money. Not everything though. I do want to say that. Other than that, the action sequences are good and the soundtrack works.I'm recommending this to MCU fans who want to continue the story. I don't think this is a great film, but where it goes from here has my interest piqued finally.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","6/10"

"rexmatthewj","19 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final installment in the iconic adventure franchise that started with Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981. Directed by James Mangold and co-written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp, and Mangold himself, the film brings back Harrison Ford as the legendary archaeologist and adventurer, who must once again stop a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist from using a powerful ancient artifact to alter the course of history.The film is set in 1969, a time of social and political turmoil, as well as scientific and technological breakthroughs. The film explores how Indy fits into this changing world, as he faces retirement, loneliness, and grief.The film also features a formidable villain in Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Jurgen Voller, a former Nazi astrophysicist who works for NASA but has a secret agenda. Mikkelsen is menacing and captivating, as he portrays a man who is obsessed with power and glory.The film also suffers from some overuse of CGI effects, especially in the opening sequence where Ford is digitally de-aged to look like his younger self during World War II. The effect is distracting and uncanny, and it takes away from the realism and authenticity of the film. The film also relies too much on familiar action set pieces, such as chases involving trains, cars, bikes, planes, etc. Some of these scenes are thrilling and inventive, but others feel repetitive and derivative. The film also lacks some of the mystery and wonder that made the previous films so captivating.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a mixed bag that offers some entertainment and frustration. It is neither the best nor the worst film in the franchise, but a safe and predictable one that fails to please anyone. It is a film that shows its age and lacks identity. It is a film that could have been better with more originality, creativity, and daring. It is a worthy farewell to one of the most iconic characters in cinema history, but it does not match the brilliance of the original trilogy.","2/10"
"rexmatthewj","3 March 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is the third installment in the Ant-Man franchise and the first film in Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as they explore the Quantum Realm, a subatomic dimension where they encounter strange creatures and a powerful villain named Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).The film has a lot of visual spectacle and creativity, as it showcases the wonders and dangers of the Quantum Realm. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining, especially when Ant-Man and Wasp use their shrinking and growing abilities to fight their enemies. The film also introduces some new characters, such as Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), Scott's teenage daughter who becomes a political activist, and Jentorra (Katy O'Brian), a Mandalorian-like warrior who helps them in their quest.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from being a great movie. The plot is convoluted and messy, as it tries to juggle too many elements and subplots without giving them enough development or coherence. The film also lacks the humor and charm that made the previous Ant-Man movies so enjoyable, as it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the fun factor. The film also makes some tonal departures from the earlier films, as it deals with darker themes such as trauma, guilt, and genocide.The most disappointing aspect of the film is Kang the Conqueror, who is supposed to be the new main antagonist of the MCU. While Jonathan Majors gives a good performance, his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. He is introduced too abruptly and without much explanation or motivation, making him seem like a generic and bland villain. He also does not pose much of a threat to Ant-Man and Wasp, as they easily defeat him in the end.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some positive aspects, such as the visual effects, the action scenes, and some of the performances, but it also has some negative aspects, such as the plot, the screenplay, and Kang the Conqueror. It is not a terrible movie, but it is not a great one either. It is a mediocre movie that could have been much better.","4/10"

"rezaeirhamid","23 February 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a tiny but mighty addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang, and he's still as charming and hilarious as ever. From the opening scene, you're immediately reminded of what makes this character so fun to watch. He's just an ordinary guy who happens to have a suit that allows him to shrink and grow at will. That's it. And yet, he still manages to get into all sorts of trouble.The movie also introduces us to some new characters, including Kang the Conqueror, who's played by Jonathan Majors. Kang is a time-traveling villain who's unlike anything we've seen before in the MCU. He's arrogant, powerful, and has a wicked sense of humor. Majors absolutely nails the role, and his interactions with Rudd are some of the funniest moments in the movie.Of course, we can't forget about the Wasp, played by the always fantastic Evangeline Lilly. She's every bit as skilled and badass as she was in the first movie, but she's also given more depth and nuance in this one. We get to see more of her relationship with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and we also get to see her struggle with the consequences of her actions.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a hilarious, action-packed adventure that's sure to delight fans of the MCU. Paul Rudd is once again the standout, but the entire cast is excellent, and the story is a lot of fun. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a good laugh, this movie is definitely worth checking out.","7/10"
"RforFilm","17 July 2017","If you want to talk about how a proper reboot of a series is done, then The Planet of the Apes is the answer. I'll admit that I've seen none of the old movies, though I'm already aware of the big spoiler from the original, which is practically one of the most famous twists of all time. But I'm not here to talk about those, but rather the reboot movies that started with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Rather then remaking the original, it chose to take a different spin on how the apes became intelligent enough to pose a threat to the humans. Rise of the Planet of the Apes proved to be a major surprise with a lot of critics and audiences finding a lot of sympathy with not only the apes, but apes that were completely computer generated. Plus you have to give a lot of credit to actor Andy Serkis (Gollum from The Lord of the Rings) who brings a lot of depth to his character Caesar and all through the magic of motion capture. Now that Rise and Dawn had built up how this world has succumbed to it's own troubles, we get the finale of the prequel trilogy with War for the Planet of the Apes. Set years after Dawn, Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) is still haunted by his memories of Koba, an ape that started the war between the humans and primates. Though they all seem to be living safe in the Muir forest, the Alpha-Omega, who seem to be the remaining U.S. military forces, come in to try to take out the apes. Caesar announces that he wants the entire clan to move out in the desert where they will be safe from the human. The night before they were to leave, their fortress is attacked and Caesar's wife Cornelia are killed by the leader of the Alpha-Omega, The Colonel (played by Woody Harrelson).Caesar orders the apes to set out for the desert while he heads to the Alpha-Omega headquarters to kill the Colonel in revenge. He's joined by orangutan Maurice, and fellow chimpanzee Rocket to make sure that Caesar is safe. The apes discover many things including a mute human orphan girl that Maurice adopts, an ape named ""Bad Ape"" (played by Steve Zahn), and that the virus that killed most humans may be worse for the ones that lived. Caesar and the apes make it to the headquarters to discover something horrible.As far as this is going, War for the Planet of the Apes continues to rise like the apes who want to be seen as smart and elusive. This movie accomplishes that goal and them some. This happens to be a blockbuster that delivers on the action, but manages to put a lot of emotion into the idea that your about to take on the responsibility of leadership. Sure, some may already see this as a story that doesn't end well for the humans, but you see the tragedy of that the weight Caesar feels when he comes to this conclusion.War for the Planet of the Apes takes cues from the previous Ape movies and revenge westerns to make this the most personal journey for Caesar he has had to undergo. His journey takes him through a beautifully shot film that flows at smooth place, though it does become a little too slow before they reach the humans hideout. Had the CGI been bad, this movie would have fell apart, but I found myself constantly forgetting that I was watching that. The apes have some of the most reactive faces that could rival any bad human actor.Of course I have to talk about Andy Serkis who remains a highly underrated actor. I'm not sure why motion capture performances are rarely noted, but his response through the machines his fantastic. I don't think it's Oscar worthy, but he brings a lot of depth to his character and even seems to connect with his other performances simultaneously to create an arc that spans the three movies. While the humans do well, this movie belongs to the apes who can proudly claim this as their magnum-opus.I'll give this nine Caesars out of ten. While you don't need to see the other movies, I'd still recommend doing so before checking this out. While I'm glad to see this trilogy end on a high note, I'm curious to see if the box office grossings would justify more movies from this series (maybe a possible adaptation of the original Planet of the Apes?). Give the apes their movie and check it out.","9/10"
"rgcustomer","27 November 2012","At the end of Life of Pi, the talented liar Pi asks the visiting Writer to choose between his two stories -- one a short brutal story of human cruelty and desperation, and the other a long romantic story of bonding with a dangerous animal. (Despite Pi's stated claims, gods actually don't play any part in the long story).Nobody proposes that the Writer (or audience) should reject both of Pi's stories, even though that's good advice.The Writer of course chooses the more detailed and uplifting romantic story. It saves him from having to come up with it himself. Presumably, this is the manner in which the Writer is convinced to ""believe in (some) god"" although that's never said directly. In any case, his goal is to sell books, not to seek truth. It's not hard to guess which story is going to sell, and real life is in the process of confirming it.But the audience eventually wants the truth. We're clearly to assume that one of the stories is true (within the context of the film). Pi insists both stories are possible, suggesting we can freely choose equally. But that's not quite correct. Probabilities must be weighed. I buy the tiger story, up to a point (although perhaps I shouldn't... remember the scorpion and frog story from The Crying Game: ""it's in my nature""). But for me, probability ends at the ""carnivorous island"". It's extremely unlikely that there would be an undetectable island literally covered with fish-eating meerkats, who act indifferently to being eaten themselves, as depicted in the film. I'm more likely to believe in a mentally ill, bigoted ship's cook who takes advantage of a crisis to torture and kill. There is plenty of reason to believe that story over the other. It happens all the time on land.Somewhere between the two probabilities, it's also possible that the liar Pi survived at sea alone, and didn't just make up one bold lie, but two. But that would be a dull story, and Pi is clearly not one to tolerate boredom and dullness.The Japanese men appeared to accept the brutal story, but we're never told whether they transmitted that story to others. What of the families of the men claimed to be on the lifeboat? This story would have been an outrage, with possible legal consequences.Pi's story, because he so easily bears false witness, is unmoving, and I wasn't made into a believer by watching this film. If anything, it all fits comfortably with my unbelief. The film concludes in such a way as to demonstrate that these fanciful and sometimes pretty stories are there to hide darker ones, or more boring ones, and also to cast those who doubt them as somehow being suspect of supporting bad outcomes. We know this is how religion works, but it's nice to see it spelled out so clearly on the big screen.As for the film itself, it's quite an achievement in animation mixed with live action, and 3D cinematography. I'll have to see what The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does with high-frame rate, but Life of Pi should certainly be up for some significant awards in that area. (Yet, truly James Cameron is still the undefeated master of sinking a ship, and creating marvels that glow in the darkness.) Last, I also just saw Kumaré, which I recommend as a good double-feature with this film.","7/10"
"rgkarim","13 January 2024","LIKES:The Pace
-The movie is like most Statham led movies, very loud and very fast, much like the theme of his series Crank.-The Beekeeper doesn't pull its foot of the gas for much of the movie, and for those who love the adrenaline rush, you are in great shape to enjoy this film.-It pretty much stays at a nice hundred miles an hour, but also takes time to reset for some faster paced setups to get you ready for the next mayhem to unleash on the screen.-All in all, great for those with fleeting attention spans.The Humor
-Whether direct or indirect, I laughed a lot in this movie, so much so that it made me have some of the most fun in a film I have had.-The Beekeeper has plenty of zingers to sting your funny bone, making you crack up with the way Statham dryly delivers a message, or Irons sarcasm and logic comes out like Scar.-Poking fun at the government system and the political jokes were toned back, purposeful and nicely finessed to be very, very fun without being too much.-And throw the character profiles being extremely goofy and adding an element of their own only helping further make the ordeal stupid fun and entertaining, alongside some of the stunts and finishes that just scream suspense of disbelief.The Story To A Degree
-It's got a better story than I anticipated, one that is simple, easy to follow, and perfect anchoring to the mishaps coming.-The Beekeeper's story surprisingly has some decent character development to mix in, helping give some clarity to a few of the players in this weird game of extreme action chess.-And there is a little bit of a nice ""twist"" to the mix that should help give a little more to the plot they are conveying, but not enough to trip or offset the main focus of this movie.The Action Scenes On Many Moments
-Perhaps the meat of the movie, the action is all about what most will be coming to see this movie for, and I'll say, it's fun to say the least.-From the first bout on, Statham and the team get creative in just how much fun a special agent can have with the masses, providing lots of playgrounds to do battle on that help mix up the theme of the action at hand.-Throw in the combat essentially changing hands to be one part martial arts, one part knife play, and many parts gunplay, and well, you have one heck of an arsenal to get invested into.-And many of these movements have such rawness to it, a destructive bout of shots and editing to really give you everything action junkies want in a movie with such a hardened lead.-This is where the sound and cinema work the most. Not in the beautiful shots of emotional wellness, or the beautiful backdrop, and backdrops. .
-No, instead this time it's about pulling together and bringing the pure spectacle of elite ops vs. The world, and it accomplishes it in that Statham glory.The Emotional Fulfillment
-There are those movies that know how to deliver that shot and moment that just screams full satisfaction.-To my surprise, the Beekeeper accomplished this for me, several of those moments captured in the perfect shot as the Statham gets that hit or kill that just makes you nod.-It adds a little more to the violence, gives some depth to his character without words, and helps to give this movie just that bit of depth that other films in this franchise lose when it's all about mediocre presentation.The Music
-A nice little mix of genres, the music has some comedic aspects and energy as Clay journeys on his quest for vengeance.-One part is song you will know, a blend of a lot of tracks that match the dynamic of the scene. While the other part is a typical Hollywood soundtrack of powerful instruments in the background to add that small oomph to the symphony of sound effects.DISLIKES:The Plot
-It's nothing special and quite linear, good on many levels, but will get lost in the sea of action films that we have.-There is little diving into most characters, it's quite lacking in terms of unique fervor, and the extra information just doesn't have the delivery that much of the John Wick series does.-It's not what most are going for, but... given some of the legendary actions films have a bit more meat to their, I can't say I wasn't disappointed not to have more to the story.It's Sort Of Ridiculous
-To an extent, all action movies are ridiculous.-But in this film, the movie's stunts are sometimes a bit too silly and extreme to not laugh and lose the respect and focus I had in the first part of the film.-Throw in the unbalanced strength factors in this movie being quite wider than I like to see and the movie just breaches a story that sort of lacks that organization I like to see in movies like these that have that balance of comic awesomeness and reality edge.Excessive Language
-By this point I've become desensitized, but the language is annoying at times to the point that again, there are better phrases and words to use.-The F and MF terminology is their bread and butter of the movie, so if you have a sensitivity for these words, avoid this movie at all costs or be ready expletive city.-It's lazy writing at times, but it sells, and at times they nail the timing and make it worthwhile.Some Violence Hard To Watch
-There are many moments that desensitized people like me can handle with no issues and laughing at the pure bliss of excitement.-And then there are some moments that are going to be hard, cringeworthy stabs, carving, and a few other means that are going to be hard to watch.-Though it doesn't hit the levels of Hostel or Saw, it may still be something to be wary of given some of the finishing moves Statham brings with it.An Element Of Action.-Mainly a lot of invincibility/superman complexes for much of the movie that can lead it to be a bit boring.-Wick, Olympus has Fallen, James Bond, and more take hits and come close to taking hits, which adds excitement, fun, and that danger sense.-The BeeKeeper though doesn't do this much of the movie, meaning the spectacle and finishes carry the excitement rather than the threat to our antihero. Had they cleaned that up a bit, it might have added even more to the mix.The VERDICT:
The BeeKeeper is a smash hit when it comes to the mindless action and fun of watching a one man army take out the bad guys. Very fast, very exciting, and holding enough merit to build a foundation that will give a meaning to the chaos and violence you are watching. Comedy helps add some pizazz to the mix, a little relief to the darker undertones that go well with the action. Add in the sense of justice and some engaging action that really helps this movie thrive and excel in the promised entertainment the trailers sent in their advertising. And with the simplicity comes the limitations of story, the stupid antics that are hyperbolic feats of super human levels, and some rather one sided antics that can be a bit stale. Throw in some hyper language use and some hard to watch moments, and you round out this movie to some Statham fun that is familiar, a tad stale, and dare I say a bit too familiar to be unique and engaging. Still, this one is worth a trip to the theater for just the fun times, and definitely one worth watching at home.My scores:
Action/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.","8/10"
"rgkarim","17 February 2023","LIKES:The Graphics/World Design
-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","7/10"
"rgkarim","2 June 2023","LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part
-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting
-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling
-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree
-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs
-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes
-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style
-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced
-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets
-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me
-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters
-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:
Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5.","9/10"
"rgkarim","22 November 2012","Next up on my Thanksgiving weekend reviews is the newest novel based movie called Life of Pi. This past summer I was captivated by the wonderful trailer that was visually stunning and had a killer soundtrack that matched the flow of the trailer. When I found out Ang Lee was directing it I got even more excited that this film was going to be an artistic wonder. Since I hadn't read the book though, I had no idea what else I was in store for other than a modern version of the Cast Away movie. So what did this movie have to offer? Read on to find out.For those who haven't seen the trailer or read the book, Life of Pi is the tale of a man named Piscine Patel, known by most as Pi, an Indian boy who likes to question many rules and discover new lessons. On the voyage to a new home in Canada, the boat Pi and his family are riding capsizes leaving him stranded with a few animals and some rations on a small lifeboat. The teenage boy will discover a world he never imagined, while struggling to maintain his life in the lonely world of the ocean.That's pretty much the plot, so you might wonder what makes this movie different from Cast Away, other than the main character is Indian and there is a tiger. I'll start with talking about the visuals of this move, which for me and a couple of my buddies was the best element of the movie. From the get go, the cinematography is amazing capturing the natural beauty of the Indian continent. As the opening credits start, the audience is treated to some well angled shots of the various zoo creatures, each doing their own thing as if nothing is happening. Once the movie officially starts though, the camera work continues to get better, with every angle being selected to get the most out of the scene. Even the chaotic scenes aboard the sinking ship were well captured, skipping the chaotic camera angles for the use of CGI and visuals to create the feelings of uncontrolled fear. When calm eventually returns the desolate world of the vast ocean is impressively recreated on the screen. Many of its inhabitants are well polished and designed to have you thinking they are real, that is until you get a closer look. Upon focusing on the actual creatures, you can see where the realism starts to blur a bit, as the animals become a little too polished and clean. Despite this though, the animation for the animals is still impressive, capturing their movements to the finite detail and adapting them to the interaction with Pi and the tiger. Thus the artistic aspects of this movie are definitely prevailing in this movie. A second big quality of this movie is the spirituality built into this feature film. Before even pushing out on the boat, Pi begins experimenting with multiple religions, each being explained in their connection to the deities. Those interested in religion will get a nice refresher course in theology; though will appreciate more of the practice in this movie. Scenes where Pi prays or talks to God are sure to strike up some feelings in fans, whether good or bad really depends on the person. For this reviewer, it did make me thankful for many things, and helping strengthen my spiritual connection. There are even a few other scenes that seem like a trippy experience into the spiritual realm that is visually beautiful, but still a little weird. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. What else is there to mention about this movie? Well I can warn you now that there are some graphic scenes of life that may disturb some people. I admit that some of the animal hostility in this film made me very sad, and could make little kids cry their eyes out. Despite this sadness though, I have to admit it is very realistic as when fighting for survival animals can turn into savage monsters. Those looking for a story with lots of twists and turns are also advised to skip this movie as well, since it is little more than an Indian boy fighting for survival and documenting his adventure. However, those who like movies that dive into the mind and character are going to be up for this film. Another thing about this film is the pace of the movie keeps things a little slow. Again this is a life adventure, but did we really need over two hours of film to see this? For this reviewer not really, as half an hour less could have helped with the long dragging feeling of this film. The acting by Suraj Sharma was very passionate at many points in the movie and well representative of the emotions. Unfortunately some of the scenes forced him to be a little too passionate in his yelling, leading to a little over-dramatic tension.To wrap this review up, Ang Lee and company have created a visually stunning masterpiece that makes you think about your spiritual beliefs. With award winning animation, polished creature design, beautiful settings and cinematography, and some well done editing, it's no doubt this movie will be a candidate for best visual effects. What could have made it even better though was adding a soundtrack like the trailer to further bring out the magic, instead of just using it for the sad scenes. Regardless this movie is best seen in the theater with the visuals, yet if you go for plot wait until it releases on Netflix. My scores for this movie are the following: Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 please email rkarim11@su.edu for constructive criticism","7/10"
"rhbouchard","12 July 2023","The theme that teenagers know better than their parents has been done to death. ""They don't know me"" is also a tired cliche. Lotsa flashes of color seem pointless other than to get the ADHD generation's attention and to stretch out the running time. The first half is rather dreary. The second half is more interesting with more plot twists than an O. Henry anthology, but by then I'd lost interest and resented that they made me sit through the first half. The end is a shameless ""To Be Continued"". You would think the writers would have followed the multiverse underpinning and came up with something more original and succinct.","9/10"
"rhqk","31 January 2024","Wow! Wow! Kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat. This is the best movie I have seen in a while, well since the last Jason picture. I loved it! Great stunt work too and great tricks and toys. The script was perfect, the casting was perfect and the acting was perfect. This is coming from a lay person and not a professional critic so you know my opinion is the one that counts. I have a ten but if I could have given it more starts I would. It's 100/100. I will see it again and again. Bravo Jason. Nice directing as well. Can't wait for Jason's next picture it's gotta be better than this one. Yay!!","6/10"
"ribalzafar-00863","13 April 2019","Yes, ok. This was a great movie. All the characters had their backgroud stories well balanced, something which lacked in all previous movies but I really don't understand that why all the dragon ball movies are based on just Brolly.

"Rich-91749","1 July 2023","What an absolute load of garbage.The opening scene is decent. Classic Indiana Jones, well-paced action with some slight outlandish fun...Then we fast forward and the real movie starts. This is where the movie drops from a 7/10 to a 1/10 very quickly,Indie is a shell of a character. Harrison is there only for the paycheque and it really shows. The writing of the character is lazy. A tired trope of a jaded once-hero turned-loser.Phoebe viscount the posh is just the absolute worst. Devoid of any charisma and reeking of arrogance in both the writing of the character and the actor's portrayal. Incredibly unlikeable.Then as the story develops you realise the plot is nonsense. Indie has no impact on it at all and is basically a mcguffin to allow the story to occur.I really hated this film and I wanted to like it.Bad. Bad. Bad.","2/10"
"rich-flynn","30 January 2024","This film is atrocious! It doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a really poor John Wick impersonation. Watch as the bots and promoters somehow get the score at a peak (currently 6.7!) to claw in the viewers before the viewers reviews bring it back down. Don't believe the hype and salvage two hours of your life!The script is appalling, almost comedic in its lack of depth and what Jeremy Irons is doing in this film makes it even sadder, what is an actor of his calibre even doing here, topping up his pension I presume?For Jason, it's run of the mill stuff really, he's never Oscar worthy but this film is right up his alley!","8/10"
"Rich-Lee-Bailey","9 February 2024","I'll watch any movie with Jason Statham in it, and I am more than likely always going to enjoy it. The film does have that whole John Wick vibe, like, you don't mess with John Wick, and the same goes for the beekeeper.I do miss the good old real kick-ass Statham has delivered previously in his transporter films. The film could have showcased more of Statham's impressive fighting skills, which would have been a great addition.I enjoy a good action film like this now and then. It's not cinema material, but not many films are these days.The girl playing the FBI agent whose mum got killed in the beginning has no acting abilities whatsoever. She sucks just as badly in this as she does in the umbrella academy. Something about her is annoying, but I can't pinpoint it.","10/10"
"Richard-Nathan","2 December 2023","I had thought it would be impossible to produce an Indiana Jones movie that was worse than ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull,"" but I was wrong. ""Skull"" was only 2 hours and 2 minutes in length. ""Dial of Destiny"" was 2 hour and 34 minutes of tedium. It had no charm, no wit, not enough action, and all the characters were unlikeable. There is something dreadfully wrong with a film when you like the Nazi more than you like the hero's sidekick (and I say that as a man who considers himself a feminist).If you want to watch a model film about a hero who is past his prime, please watch ""Robin and Marian.""","6/10"
"richardchatten","11 December 2022","Pierre Boule who wrote the original 1963 novel doesn't even get a mention in the credits. The scintilla of wit on display in the opening sequence of troops going into battle with 'Monkey Killer' and 'Bedtime for Bonzo' on their helmets is never thereafter repeated.The combat sequences look like a grotesque parody of the Vietnam War and as usual it takes itself very seriously and goes on forever. Nevertheless the money's all up there on the screen and the majestic peaks of snowbound British Columbia provide an impressive backdrop.The film desperately misses Jerry Goldsmith's score for the original, but Amiah Miller is a cute little tyke and the scene where her guardian hands her a spring of pink blossom is genuinely touching. The actual makeup has come on by leaps and bounds enabling Woody Harrelson to take off his shades and declare ""My God! Look at your eyes... almost human!""","9/10"
"Richie-67-485852","2 May 2019","I remember when Superman died and how in the comic book world there was shock, dismay and great out cry necessitating him coming back. It served the purpose of hooking the audience and holding them captive. The same thing was applied to Spock dying in Star Trek again proving successful in generating fan response and revenue. Before Endgame came out and I only had the second movie to go by, I knew they all had to come back and I also knew that time travel played a part in it as there are only so many ways to come back. Sure enough, Endgame time-traveled and brought them back. The formula still works. Logically speaking, Disney didn't spend mutli-billions to kill everyone off however in the comic book world of which I keep reminding myself that anything is possible they can get away with these things. Knowing this before hand diminished my enjoyment of the Endgame but it wasn't limited to just that either. I am watching after everyone is brought back and they still couldn't defeat Thanos as a group or individually and that is without the stones mind you. With the stones they prevail making the stones more important than any Marvel character known. Before you vote on my sharing, be advised I have been reading comics for decades and was raised in that world and even collected them. I support and encourage the comic book world but would like them to keep it closer to reality than all-out fantasy suspension of major beliefs. One last thing. They keep using God as in OMG or other variations which totally contradicts the comic book world. That shouldn't be in the script for GOD is the ultimate super-hero and his comic would outsell everyones. Keep it real and I'll keep coming back.","7/10"
"richwgriffin-227-176635","15 December 2012","A+. Cinematography, editing, visual effects (one of the finest uses of 3D technology I've ever seen), sound, music, script, direction and superlative acting (Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan both deserve Oscar nominations for their extraordinary performances) - this film is a must see! The tiger is ferocious, not a Disney cute and cuddly animal, but a real and frightening animal. I was gripped by this film for it's entire 2 hours and 5 minutes. Please see this movie on a large screen in a theatre; it is so worth it! (: This film is a hundred times better than ""Lincoln"" a million times better than the worst film of the year (""Zero Dark Thirty"", one of the worst movies ever made in cinema history). A+. This film should be nominated in every possible category, and I would especially like to see Mr. Sharma and Mr. Khan get richly deserved nominations (way better performances than the over-praised Daniel Day-Lewis, Alan Arkin, Bradley Cooper, Tommy Lee Jones - just my opinion, of course!)

"rickothan","2 June 2023","This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so.

"RightOnDaddio","13 January 2024","There is so much to like about this movie.It's got Minnie Driver in it. She's been driving a path to my heart for, yikes, thirty years now.Josh Hutcherson is a villain. And a darn good one.He's likable, funny, stupid and despicable all at once and it is lovely to see.He takes full advantage of his role and the audience in full reaps the benefits.This movie has cinematic testosterone with a capital T squeezed right from the glorious 1980's and butt-kicking with a capital B.They pair together rather nicely as they often do.The kills are plenty and plenty creative.Director David Ayer doing what he always does best.And Jeremy Irons stepping in and classing up the joint.This is a most welcome original theatrical release for January.It's not a comic book movie or a Star Wars movie.It's not a reboot, sequel or prequel.It's Jason Statham doing Jason Statham things.And it is a blast to watch on the big screen.I also highly recommend another Beekeeper film, Ulee's Gold (1997) starring Peter Fonda. It too, is quite buzz worthy.","8/10"
"Rightopinionguys","7 June 2023","War for the Planet of the Apes- a movie that captures all emotions in one epic finale. Honestly, if there was an 11/10 option, I would rate it that without a shadow of a doubt. At a faster pace than 'Rise' but a slower pace than 'Dawn', this movie sits very comfortably at the top of the Planet of the Apes trilogy, and at second in command to the original planet of the apes in the whole franchise rankings.The music is arguably Michael Giacchino's finest work, and could stand level with the music to 'Up' which won an Oscar for best soundtrack. In terms of acting, Woody Harrelson does a doe did job of playing the awful Colonel, and his backstory was well written and thought of. Andy Serkis, as always, does what he does best in terms of CGI. The storyline is golden and has definitely been deeply run through, and Matt Reeves as a director has done very, very well. What can I say, this movie is excellent!Consider every category, and know that I rate all of them 10/10.","4/10"

"ritchiep-56574","26 April 2019","First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!Fans! Assemble!","9/10"

"ritesh657","3 June 2023","SpidermanAcrossTheSpiderverseReviewMy Rating : 96/100Across The Spiderverse is a spellbinding and mesmerizing experience and passes the sequel test with aplomb. Starting from developing the endearing characters we loved from the first part, it adds a few solid new ones which are written as brilliantly as we can expect. The dazzling cinematography and animations leaves you tranfixed and the thrilling plot shifts leave you floored. Spiderverse is expanded vividly with the captivating work of humour, emotions and keeps you excited for what next throughout. The loudest hooting when Pavitra Prabhakar , our very own desi Indian Spider-Man comes on screen got me exhilarated. With almost all emotions getting evoked with the drama, tension and elevated climax, the cliffhanger makes me thrilled for the final act. Magical experience.The writing is superlative and introduction of the new concept of Canon event definitely opens up new possibilities. Miguel's Spiderman is terrorizing and adds more seriousness to the plot. While the emotional moments of Miles and Gwen with their family add to the list of winsome moments during the course of the runtime. Manhattan is now Mumbattan and Pavitra Prabhakar made us go crazy. The action and visuals are enthralling to say the least.Overall, if you likes the part 1 stop reading ahead and go watch this epic spectacle asap and if you haven't then its the right time of this weekend to catch up both parts and join in the community of Miles Morales fan club.Instagram & Twitter : streamgenx.","10/10"
"rivertam26","25 November 2012","Acclaimed director Ang Lee has taken the supposedly unfilmable book and turned it into an overlong, technically brilliant mixed bag. Centering on a young boy who finds himself stranded on a boat with a Bengal tiger after a ferocious storm sinks the ship he was on. There is about 40 minutes before leading up to those vents where we meet the main character and his family. I got the themes of truth vs. fiction, coming of age in the face of tragedy and the symbolism of an animalistic nature, but i can't say that I got anything to deep or profound from this film. And there are many reasons I believe I didn't but here let's start with the good. The movie is technically brilliant. The effects are truly sensational especially the animal design. it's truly captivating to say the least and the movie also has some inspired whimsical cinematography. Now for the not so good I found myself unimpressed with the films human performances especially the central one. It's not that he was bad but he failed to engage especially in the face of such incredible events it just didn't feel emotionally resonant and engaging like it should have and part of that lies in the direction which I'd like to say was solid for the most par. But here's the thing once you discover what this film is about it kind of is unfilmable. It's something that works much better on the page. Because as a film it just doesn't mesh well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone thinking of seeing it. but if you're expecting to be inspired and feel as though there is a strong profound message that will mirror something in your life, you're going to be disappointed. The film is just what it is and nothing more in my opinion at least. It moves along ploddingly and although it has genuine moments of cinematic inspiration it fails to really connect on a level that counts and after a while it all feels like you are the one barely surviving.","9/10"
"riziger","28 February 2013","Life of Pi is a story about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck with a Bengal tiger. If that doesn't perk your interest, I'm not too sure what will. This film is a proper adventure story with storytelling that takes you on a journey in a way that I've not experienced in awhile. And boy how it has been translated to visual form is breathtaking. No surprises at all at the cinematography, directing and visual Oscars it's won with the best animation I have ever seen. I can honestly say that in almost no scene was any animation apparent and that just immersed me more into the adventure.Suraj Sharma does a brilliant job as the shipwrecked Pi, and Irrfan Khan plays an understated but equally charming adult Pi. The tiger, Richard Parker, forms a bond with the viewer that creeps up on you, and by the end I was hoping for it's survival as much as for Pi's. For something that spends the majority of the film as an animation, I thought that was fantastic. Perhaps the only con is the religion angle that some may not appreciate. However, I found it was just a facet of the plot and I had no problems with it.I'm going to put myself on the chopping block and say this is one of the most complete films I've seen in a long time. Charming plot, perfectly cast, with a big enough budget to bring it to life visually. I will also say, that I believe this deserved the best picture Oscar. A must watch.","7/10"

"rizwanyasin","18 February 2023","After reading some reviews, I thought it's going to be terrible and was expecting disappoint. However, it was actually decent movie. J Major did a awesome job playing Kang. Also if you've watched Loki season 1 on Disney then you'll understand the story line much better. I do feel like they could have taken a bigger risk with the story line. There are two end credit scene, I believe it was worth it staying for the first end credit scene but not the last end credit scene. All it did was setup a Disney plus series.My final advise would be to rewatch Loki season 1 before going to watch quantanmania.","7/10"
"RJBrez","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","10/10"

"rjennica","22 November 2012","This movie took me by surprise. I thought it was just about a young boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive on a small boat. But it was much more than that, for it conjured up thoughts, spiritually, visually, and intellectually. The actors were amazing and so, the Director Ang Lee. If you do see it, try and catch the 3D showing featuring the largest BTX screen/ multi-channel surround sound. I'm positive it would still be satisfying without those perks, but you will enjoy it much, much, more because it brings you into the location physically. I almost got seasick watching it because the huge screen was so, all encompassing. This movie features an all-Indian cast with acting skills displayed beyond the norm. Everything was so natural, as if no script was ever written. Spontaneity abounded throughout the film. The only negative: the theater turned up the sound too loud.","8/10"
"rk911","13 May 2018","Marvel seems to be on a roll towards killing off this franchise. The previous entry...Black Panther...was, generously, just OK but Av:IW was just awful. This entry was abt an hour too long and way too slow to develop. I had trouble staying awake at times. The final battle scene was OK but the entire movie was dark. I don't mean the theme, I mean the pucture itself was dark. So dark that in some interior scenes it was difficult to see what was going on. Save your time and money.","9/10"
"rmgwong","15 July 2017","I haven't commented in IMDb for a long timeI saw the publicity poster which showed an army of humans facing an army of apes who were standing guard over a fortress with snow mountains in the background. This scene did not happen! The ending battle scene was between human armies with the apes running away like - apes. The final scene was too short and totally implausible, with only one grenade aimed at an exposed oil tank left in the open right behind the wall, setting of an explosion that destroys the whole base. I also do not understand why the mute girl Nova was introduced in the story. I think this movie cannot possibly deserve a 8.4 rating on IMDb, it must be all the studio trolls at work.","2/10"
"RNMorton","9 May 2018","Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. ""The sum is much less than the parts"", and/or ""Way too much on the plate"". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.","2/10"
"roaches_97","6 June 2023","Across the Spider Verse is a very solid movie. It's not the masterpiece that the insane hype train would have you believe, but it's very good. As of right now, this movie has a higher IMDb score than some of the greatest movies of all time (Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, all the Lord of the Rings movies) and I don't really think it's deserved. I'm sure it will be a lot better to look back on once part two comes out, but as of right now it does feel like half of a movie. The animation and voice acting are both great, it has good action, and some of the references and visual gags were cool. I would recommend seeing this in the theater, but I'd say wait a few weeks. I saw it opening weekend in a theater packed full of drooling fanboys who cheered at every single reference. It was maybe the worst theater experience I've ever had. I don't think it's as great as the first but it was a good movie.","10/10"

"Robert_duder","14 August 2017","If nothing else The new Plant of The Apes series proved why ""reboots/remakes"" can be a very good thing. This series has been unbelievable for action, special effects, drama and a new twist on an old story. The character development for a group of CGI apes is completely astonishing. The first two films were staples of my previous summers. I was very excited to see the latest film and I was not disappointed. War for The Planet Of The Apes is not the best of the three but it's also more story driven and wrapping up any loose ends to this particular part of the story (Caesar's Trilogy.) The battle scenes are quite brutal and the interesting thing is you see an evolution to this trilogy where in the original film the focus was on James Franco and his pet ape, the second film balanced the human story with the Apes and now you have this third film where this is entirely from the view of the Apes as they work to build their own land and freedom. The only ""good"" human in the film is one who is almost completely de-evolved. I have always respected how much time and effort they spent on these films and that nothing was ever rushed or pushed. I think they end this perfectly and perhaps leave enough open for a new direction.I'm not sure anyone realizes what Andy Serkis has done for acting. He doesn't just motion capture is characters. He plays every aspect of this character. He made Caesar a film legend. He has depth of character and evolution over the course of three films. His emotional and brooding expressions and personality make you emotionally invested in this. Woody Harrelson is mesmerizing as the vicious Colonel who is the human embodiment of everything Caesar and his apes have been up against is perfectly cast. Steve Zahn and Karin Konoval are very good as well as Caesar's closest allies and family helping him against The Colonel. Amiah Miller is riveting as the human girl they end up taking along with them. Matt Reeves on the big screen has done some incredible work in my opinion. Let Me In was breathtaking and then Dawn of The Planet of The Apes he made a sequel that in many ways was superior to the first two and is easily one of the best mainstream films in the last decade. I think he had a strong vision for how he wanted this to go and he fulfills that perfectly. If the ultimate Blockbuster is entertaining, emotional and leaves an impression this film works but only has part of the trilogy I think. It lacks some of the depth and urgency of the first two but it does work as a closing statement to this particular chapter. Still one of the best films of the summer. 8/10","9/10"
"Robert_duder","23 November 2012","The trailers I saw for Life of Pi did nothing to explain what the movie was at all and I had not read the book nor heard of it. But I decided to give it a try. I don't like 3D, never have, it's always unimpressive. Well guess what? Ang Lee did it. I saw this in 3D and it literally is the first 3D film that made me go WOW!! The visuals are just absolutely amazing, some of the best effects I have ever seen. Fortunately this is not where the films ends it impressive streak. The story is just lovely, riveting, and so emotionally and spiritually deep. A philosophy class could talk about this movie for an entire year and still have more to say. The film doesn't even begin to try to give you a philosophy or way of life but rather is all about exploring the world and exploring the philosophies of life. As a lover of animals you will look for how all the animals in the film play a role but there are truly just animals and important lessons are learned through them. It was perhaps one of the most symbolic and deeply philosophical films I have ever seen and because of that it was incredibly entertaining and beautifully shot.While a few actors play Pi throughout various stages of his life, only one leaves an indelible and brilliant impression. Suraj Sharma at least deserves an Oscar nomination for making you feel so connected to him and displaying a brilliant display of courage and depth to his character. While he doesn't get as much screen time Irrfan Khan puts incredible emotion into his performance as adult Pi. Both Sharma and Khan bring to life a great adventurer and philosopher in the form of Pi. The supporting cast performs their parts perfectly. No one person really stands out because their goal it to get Pi into his adventure but they are still great. Adil Hussain and and Tabu are particularly good as Pi's parents.Ang Lee without a doubt must receive an Oscar nod for this film. The cinematography, the special effects, and most importantly the use of those special effects are nothing short of revolutionary. The animals are so brilliantly done and the character of the tiger (Richard Parker...love how he got his name too) is so vital to the entire story and by the time the film ends you will ache for the tiger as much as Pi does so you will feel his emotions. The film won't be for everyone. Certainly its just too intense for children with a lot of animal deaths and I can see the mainstream movie goers accusing it of being ""slow"" or ""boring"" but for anyone looking for something unique and outstanding, Life of Pi is it. I hope the critics feel the same way because this one is a home run in my books!! 9/10","7/10"
"robert-85923","11 May 2018","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.","3/10"
"RobertGolebiewski","10 July 2023","I watched this Indy movie with full of expectations and optimisms. I have heard lots about how bad the movie was. Yet I wanted it all to be mistakes.Technically the movie was very good. Pretty good scenes. Good cuts. Nice action scenes and filming. Very nice young Indy scenes.I enjoyed the ""old pals"" thing through the whole movie. Rebooting some characters and creating new ones we have never seen before.The cruelty of bad guys was untypical to the series. Previously there were punches and fists. Now there are dead bodies and I did not like it.Mads Mickelsen is always perfect in such roles of conflicted people. People of power. I love his acting and he is now at his best. I enjoy every movie he plays in. Sometimes better than main characters.Now the first lady in the movie. Completely poor casting and completely thin character. Hard to like her. And the young Indian assistant is simply boring. Again Germans angainst some political correct boy. I do not like such forced casting and story telling. It is nauseing. Feel like vomit.The story is coherent. And theme intriguing. Poorely exploited. Much better the movie than the Skull which was simply.... strange. But I enjoyed Shya Le Bauf.I miss the attempt to rescue Indy's son however I assume this hat grabbing might be getting back to the game.Again I saw a product not a movie.","8/10"
"RoBiN_SinGH211221","30 September 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","4/10"
"robinerrin","29 April 2019","This film is not as good as many of the other Marvel movies (and certainly not the 'great' film reviewers are saying it is). It started off VERY slowly / took a while to get going. HATED what they did with Thor's character - making him a fat, lazy drunk. And I really think they should have killed off Hawkeye (who had become almost unlikable / a complete psychopath0 as opposed to Black Widow (who is a fan favorite). There were also a lot of inconsistencies with regards to bringing people back from the dead - they were brought back 5 years later, but they had not aged (while everyone else around them did age). Yet somehow, Peter Parker is still going to high school with all of the same high school friends who have miraculously NOT aged (unless they had all been deleted by Thanos, I find this highly unlikely). Captain Marvel, while very cool, was made to be too powerful. They also waited far too long to bring everyone back - not until the very end of the movie. So while it was 'enjoyable' (end fight scene was fantastic), there were many things that could have been done better.","1/10"
"robinwoodpdx","23 November 2012","LIFE OF PI is an odyssey that has everything: love, danger, exotic locations, swimming with tigers, and the three major world religions. It is a staggering, nearly all-encompassing metaphor for life. It will strengthen your faith in God. And it is infused with beauty throughout, via director Ang Leeahhh.I think there are two ways you could take the story: first, as a kind of magical tall tale; second, as something quite a bit deeper--i.e., not superficial entertainment, but profound testimony by an overcomer in life. I'm guessing that people who are deep and have been through a lot of difficulties in their lives will probably get much more out of this movie, whereas others might not relate to or perhaps even recognize the subtext in it (and oh, how much they will miss!!!).It isn't necessary to read the book first, although it is marvelously well written. Rarely do I think a movie so good that I see it twice in 2 days, and I will go see it a third time soon--don't miss it on the big screen!!MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!","1/10"

"RocketeerFlyer","5 September 2023","Most Indy Fans will ENJOY this.It seems some have a REAL HATE for this fifth outing for Indiana Jones.I just don't get it?I've read what some have to say about it, but REALLY a score of 1? Insulting.One such reviewer even mentioned they rather enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so of a young looking (AI) version of Indy & yet they still gave it a ONE!I agree with them & others in saying how amazingly good (almost perfect) this younger (AI) version of Indiana was here & the ACTION seen here is about as GOOD as it's GETS in this particular film, although I enjoyed the ENDING too & whilst none of the Action Set Pieces could MATCH anything in RAIDERS or The LAST CRUSADE I did enjoy them.BUT A ONE!!!I'm not sure quiet what they expected?With Harrison Ford heading upwards of 80 Years of age now, it was clear that he was going to show his age in this film & didn't he just, I GET that some thought he should have HUNG HIS HAT UP ;) at the end of his last adventure (some 15 years or so ago) but that said, I'm fine they made it, I'm fine we saw an older, retiring Indy (which of course Harrison is now doing with this character)I READ a LOT of negative words concerning this film upon release & that may have influenced it's BOX-OFFICE but I enjoyed it.The SCRIPT isn't the BEST...I agree, it certainly hasn't got the snap & crackle of RAIDERS (THE BEST in the series by far) OR even THE LAST CRUSADE (for which we should THANK Steven Spielberg for returning him back to another RAIDERS like outing & which is a very close
2nd BEST in the series) but after those two...Is this SCRIPT here a great deal worse than 'The Temple of Doom' or 'The Crystal Skull'?Not really, I don't think so, it's about on a par with them in terms of writing.Indiana Jones films clearly WORK WELL with better scripts & stories (as per 'RAIDERS' & 'The LAST CRUSADE') it's TRUE.Yet I still enjoyed TEMPLE & to some degree THE CRYSTAL SKULL (it was LaBeouf who spoiled that particular film for most it seems? EVERYONE else
in that film was FINE & DANDY & as for the UFO / ET's? Well, it didn't bother me as much as it did some it seems, it would have played out better without LaBeouf in it, I think) although it has it's moments.As for TEMPLE, that was probably a bit too dark for me, I rather liked the OPENING half of that film more than the second inside the Temple & the goings on underground just wasn't half as exciting as having the NAZI's in pursuit in 'RAIDERS' & 'CRUSADE'.Spielberg knew this (he even said so in an interview) and so they returned INDY back into this sphere when making the wonderfully entertaining 'THE LAST CRUSADE' which brought about a legendary double act performance from both CONNERY & FORD that just makes that adventure fly by.I could have happily watched these two play out more adventures all day long.So Script wise & Story wise...HOW DOES 'The Dial of Destiny' compare?Although it's not in the same league as the BEST TWO (by far) the script is fine, there's not a lot that stops you in your tracks, but it does it what it needs to...THESE are ACTION / ADVENTURE FILMS, so the script is sort of secondary, it helps if they're better but I think it's the STORY CHOICE which helps them more as to how much your going to LOVE THEM...or NOT.Raiders & The Last Crusade for me are 10's (they actually rate 8.4 for Raiders & 8.2 for Crusade which on IMDb is right up there scoring)But which of the remaining THREE INDY films rates NOW rates the BEST out of them?IMDb has 'The Temple of Doom' in 3rd with a highly respectable score of 7.5 and 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' comes in with a low 6.2, which rates that particular film as the WORST of the INDY films in the series.ME?I like Both of those to various degrees & it's a close call as to which I like best between the battle for 4th & 5th place in Indiana Jones films...probably CRYSTAL surprisingly as the Action was better done as a whole.My 3rd BEST INDIANA JONES outing is this one ""Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny""I know that will irk some (especially regarding 'The Temple of Doom' whom many will have in 3rd)IMDb is currently rating this FINAL :( but about TIME ;) Harrison Ford Indiana Jones outing at a surprising 6.7.WHY surprising? Well after reading some reviews & the early thoughts upon it's release to cinema's I figured this might end up scoring less than 'CRYSTAL SKULL' and be closer to the 6 mark than 7, so it's seems there is SOME LOVE for this final adventure.MOST Indiana Jones fans will enjoy THIS, they'll accept it's THE GREAT Harrison Ford's swan song in the role & that it could it have been better?Is it a BAD FILM? No, far from it, If you LOVE INDY you'll probably (if not LOVE this film) ENJOY IT.We see old Indy about to retire before being thrust back into Adventure by his God Child I think she was?A SPIRITED PERFORMANCE by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, yes I had heard that some didn't like her, I cannot understand why? I think she was a GREAT FUN, her character was a HOOT & not quiet as driven by MONEY & FAME as we first thought.Loved the opening 20 minutes or so (with an AI Young Indy) after this it's true it didn't really KICK ON as I hoped it might but he's OLDER...I LOVED that Indy actually ""GOT TO SEE HISTORY"" ;) and with that we say GOODBYE to a LEGENDARY MOVIE CHARACTER & Performance from...Mr Harrison Ford (And MANY THANKS)","6/10"

We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10","10/10"
"Rod_ccsqlp","20 February 2023","This is the worse written most nonsensical marvel movie, what a waste of 300 million, Paul Rudd seems like an extra in his own movie, Kang is easily defeated, dumb comedic tone, the quantum universe is poorly designed, the daughter is more powerful than modor, first time she uses the suit and she's a master, almost single handedly defeats Kang gimme a friking break, the way they handle the whole movie is a clear sign that the whole marvel universe is tired and should retire, they handle the whole quantum verse however is convenient to their badly written plot, just doesn't make sense at all, it's not even entertaining, cgi looks 20 years old, no emotion no climax no nothing, marvel you're done go home.","8/10"

Who or how or why does one no see that they make him go to sleep so they have every opportunity to just kill him or chop his arm off or anything they want to stop him. Why would no one think that's a ridiculous thing to put in the movie. Just really gets on my nerves.","1/10"

"RogerRoger77","11 June 2023","Ok, my title is deliberately snarky, but ...Like the first movie, the animation here is spectacular. Plus, there are lots of incidental pleasures, mainly seeing all the different Spidermen and their crazy powers and costumes.However, I just wasn't that taken with the characters and plot. Maybe I'm too old for these sorts of films, but do we really need scene after scene of whiny teenagers talking about their feelings? Personally, all I really want from a Spiderman movie is some fun web action and a few zingy one liners. And a more interesting villain than the one we got here.Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I always thought the point of superheroes was to be focused on others - saving the world and all that - not endlessly dissecting their own emotions and obsessing about their families and relationships. Guess this just reflects the world we live in: a Spiderman movie for the me, me, me generation.","9/10"
"rohanumpleby","19 October 2019","In these films the desire and there work rate is fantastic, they do so well together and do well as a team. It is fun to watch them that way. It was a bit boring at times though but still very enjoyable to watch. I can't believe Iron-man has died he was so cool and did very well in his own films. Robert Downey Jr as Iron-Man did so well. And watching the fight at the end was so fun and good to watch. It is good to see that Marvel make good progress as they go along, well most of the time anyway. It is good to also see TOM HOLLAND in the film right at the end to because it gives him a chance as well as the others. He did really well as well like he always dose. And it was funny that Hulk got to have a picture with the kids and Ant-man offers and doesn't get to have a photo. It is also my favorite Marvel movie, like I said because the togetherness is so good to see. It was a good ending to, to see that it had most of the characters on their or at least the main ones. It was also funny at times as well, especially the time machine bit. They needed also to do a quest and they went back in time with the time machine that they had, it was because they needed to get the infinity stones so that Thanos could not get them. It was also a quit intense movie at times as well.","10/10"

"Rollum","22 February 2013","As soon as The Life of Pi started and the opening scene unfolded i was drawn in and i stayed there for the entire movie. I cant recall a single moment in this film where i was not engaged and on many levels. From the beginning there was a point and a meaning. I felt that i was discovering something special throughout the movie. Director Ang Lee has captured a magic in this film. Suraj Sharma as Pi the cast away was truly authentic. Irrfan Khan was subtle and mesmerizing as adult Pi. A brilliant screen play and amazing CGI made this a film experience i have not had for sometime. The incredible thing about The Life of Pi is that its able to encompass all the complexities of faith and religion in a story that seems so simple in it conclusion. I didn't see Life of Pi in 3D but i was simply blown away by the beauty of the story and that is that faith is a matter of choice.","8/10"

"roni_arg","28 January 2013","This is not just a movie, it is a real masterpiece. It is what a film should be. The cinema is the telling of a story through images and sounds and this film does all this, and more, in a very beautiful, artistic and touching way.The visuals are breathtaking. From the opening scene (the zoo), a swimming pool, even a shipwreck, to the images of the ocean, the fauna and the sky. Every frame is a beautiful picture. The colors are bright and perfectly blended. The little boat just floating in the immensity of the ocean where you can't tell where the water ends and the sky begins will amaze you.The soundtrack is magnificent. It is very touching, it sets the moods very well, and the Indian sounds suit everything wonderfully.The story is moving to the core. Everyone who has lost something or someone dear will be moved to tears. Everyone who has ever said a definite ""goodbye"" will walk out the cinema with a knot in their throats. Whether you have faith, whether you believe in God, in some power, or whether you don't, you will be looking inside yourself, wondering, reflecting.What do we have when we've lost everything? Is there a higher power? Do animals have souls? Are we any different from them? Which story do you prefer?","9/10"
"ronitsriv","4 March 2023","Awesome VFX. You could just freeze a frame and look at it for a minute to appreciate it's beauty. Expected story of a villain losing. It's not Infinity War.😁 These had few goosebumps scenes like all possibilities wanting the same thing while getting the core.I saw the comedy dial a bit down compared to Ant-man 2 but ok, the stakes were higher this time.Movies like these in which the villain is strong adds value to the character.It was weird for the villain to be destroyed by ants. Couldn't Kang have released high force fields?It had many lines which got me thinking about what may happen further in movie and more interested in the movie.This movie set up a lot of important things for the MCU and is fun to watch in 3D.","6/10"
"ronnet_2","28 June 2023","So much negativity ahead of the release considering the role of a certain female support character. Then lots of stories about early reviews being bad to mediocre at best. We went to see it today and honestly, I liked it.. quite a lot! This isn't a story about replacing Indiana Jones with a female character. This is a really good final film and a worthy send off for our beloved adventurer. Don't expect it to be as good as the original three films. Go in with an open mind and realistic expectations, and you'll walk out entertain and humming a famous tune. In the end that's what Indiana Jones movies are all about.","8/10"
"Roscorox616","18 February 2023","The movie isn't as bad as people say and it definitely is better than most of the movies we've seen in phase 4. The story was too simple that focussed heavily on setting up future projects, rather giving more focus to the characters.Jonathan Majors nailed his role as Kang and the visuals were stunning. However, it appears Marvel hasn't learnt anything from their usual formula of forced humour, as this movie had quite a lot, even in scenes that didn't require it.Overall, its a good film to watch in theatres for the visual representation and for the post-credits scene. It is a great Ant-Man movie, but a not great Marvel movie.","7/10"
"rosebudLH","13 July 2023","My husband and I have seen every Indiana Jones movie in the theater together, since we were teens until now as we're in our late 50's. When we heard this movie would open on our 39th wedding anniversary, we knew what our date was going to be. We were pretty excited. When we got our first apartment, we put up just one movie poster in our home, and it was of Indiana Jones. When I got my first smart phone, the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme became the ringtone for my husband. When my husband's employer encouraged employees to wear costumes for Halloween, my husband already had the right hat so he got the other accessories and he's been going as Indiana Jones-even won a prize-so we are big fans of this movie franchise. We're just not the sort of fans who must complain about the sequels. I don't understand fans who want to nitpick and tear apart all the sequels. I don't know how people like that can ever be satisfied.Dial of Destiny was a very satisfying bookend to Raiders of the Lost Ark-a perfect bookend! I'm frankly baffled that some people are complaining. I don't know how it could've been better! I'm elated that the cast got together to make this movie, and the story was terrific! They certainly didn't have to do it, but they did, and I'm so glad they did! Many of our friends who have seen it loved it too. I don't know what the complainers wanted or hoped for, but my husband and I enjoyed it so much, we're considering going to see it again in the theater! It's been a looooong time since we've done that, but we already want to watch it again, and we don't want to wait for streaming or DVDs to come out.This movie exceeded our expectations. I loved all the callbacks included. I loved the new characters too. The music was terrific. I loved how the movie concluded. What a good story! The writers did a great job! Go see it!","8/10"
"rowpotdroid","29 April 2018","Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.","3/10"
"roystephen-81252","13 February 2016","Ang Lee is a great filmmaker. From his early Taiwanese films like Eat Drink Man Woman to his later Hollywood productions like Brokeback Mountain, he has probably never made a bad film. (And with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon he created an unparallelled masterpiece in the history of cinema.)Pi does not disappoint, either. In fact, the beginning of the movie is a genuine surprise. I had to check it was really Ang Lee who directed the film, because it looked and felt exactly like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's work (whose unique visual and storytelling style I also happen to love). Later I learnt that it was actually Jeunet who was originally slated to direct Pi, and he had done a great deal of work on the film until he dropped out. Ang Lee emulates his style so successfully in the opening scenes that I am thoroughly convinced he could direct a true Jeunet movie any time.But he adds his own touch to the film, as well. As always, he elicits great performances from the cast, and fills the screen with haunting images. Like all of his movies, Pi is beautiful, meaningful, deeply moving and has that visceral, eye-opening, lump-in-the-throat moment at the end that an Ang Lee film never fails to deliver.","10/10"
"rs-45184","16 July 2017","Could bear no more and left the hall after first half. Most of the movie was filmed as night scenes, and apes speaking language was broken, it made the movie too boring & slow. Movie started with wired fighting scenes at night, and no where could catch movie plot. Highly disappointed with movie, it was just waste of time..","4/10"
"rs403404","29 July 2017","Remember when prequels were all the fad. ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was the first one to make a real impact. Since then we've had prequels to ""The Exorcist"", ""Alien"", ""X-Men"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""The Thing"", and even ""Dumb and Dumber"". Some are good, some not so much. However, they rarely outshine the original films that inspired them.That's where ""Planet of the Apes"" stands alone. Not only is the prequel trilogy a collection of three outstanding movies. They are also without a doubt the three best movies of the franchise. Further, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (yes, this trilogy is plagued with clumsy titles) might be the best of the bunch.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focuses largely on the human characters while ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" seemed to share screen time equally between human and apes characters. In ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the apes are very much the center of the story. Not all the apes can speak yet, so much of this plays almost like a multimillion dollar silent movie. Yet, at no point does the story ever feel like it's missing something. I have no idea what the budget of this film was, but the apes that are nearly omnipresent for the 140 minutes screen time look completely real.So far, all I've done is praise technical achievements. The story here is simple, Caesar (Andy Serkis) wants peace for the apes and wants to end the bloodshed between humans and apes. However, when a human Colonel (Woody Harrelson) attacks Caesar's family Caesar pursues the path of revenge and follows the footsteps of Koba (Toby Kebbell) from the previous movie. Despite the War in the title, this is all a very personal tale for Caesar and how his plight tells us if the apes are worthy of survival. In contrast we have the Colonel, whose plight is just as personal. Despite the fact that the Colonel is played very much as a villain, his reasons seem almost logical. He's fighting not just against the apes, but against fate. A fight he will do anything to win and his path will determine whether humanity is worthy of survival.To say more would be to reveal too much and rob you of the experience of this movie. Because that's what this movie is, an experience that's meant to be seen not read. Needless to say the performances and the direction by Matt Reaves are all phenomenal here. This is probably one of the best trilogies ever and ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the best movies of the year.","2/10"
"rshariff-66038","31 May 2023","There are rarely movies that are better then the prequel - this movie is one of them. The amount of detail in the movie and the angles are ridiculously good. I really loved how gwen and miles' stories were expanded upon, and how many new characters were introduced - especially the scientist that got hit with a bagel in the previous movie. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to view the screening of the movie, and that was the highlight of my day, keeping me on the seat waiting for the next big event. The only part I disliked was probably the ginormous cliff hanger at the end - since now I have to wait till next march to view the final movie.I CANNOT wait until the third one is released, and the day it gets released - will be going to the theater to watch it.","3/10"

"Ruben17","31 May 2023","This is whiteout a doubt peak Spider-Man and even peak cinema!Every scene in this animation movie was as good as perfect! The coloring, animation, character designs, music and the way they used the Spider humor was so funny and well timed!Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is...
It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!There are so many Easter eggs & Spider-man's it to crazy for words!What more can i say than this is a masterpiece and probably the best Spider-Man movie to date!","6/10"
"rubenm","19 January 2013","Stunning. That's the only appropriate word to describe this film. Almost every minute, Ang Lee has some visual treat in store that makes you wonder: how did he do it? Already during the opening credits, with paradise-like scenes from a zoo, you know that this film is going to be a feast of spectacular images. It's not just the scenes with the boy and the tiger on the lifeboat. That in itself is a marvelous accomplishment for a film maker. But it's so much more. The way Lee uses visual effects makes this film a sort of cinematographic fairytale. Everything is colourful, bright, beautiful and a bit unreal. Of course, we know how Ang Lee did it: with computers. But the fact that a lot of what you see is computer generated, doesn't make it less impressive. Lee is able to tell a story with computer generated images that can make the audience laugh, shiver, an perhaps even cry. At the end of the film, the audience understands how Pi feels about the tiger. And that's not because of the special effects, but because of the way Lee has told the story. You could argue that it's just that: a sort of fairytale. There's no deeper meaning, no link to the real world. 'Life of Pi' is a visual showcase, not a gripping realistic drama. But that didn't bother me. I was awed by what I saw. Perhaps the film could have been more focused. The references to religion ('thank you Vishnu, for letting me know Jesus') are a bit out of place. I suppose the philosophical and religious aspects of the story are much more elaborated in the book than in the film. Also, the visit to the floating island with the meerkats could just as well have been left out, because it isn't really necessary for the story. That was the only part of the film I thought was a bit overdone. But then again, without it we would have missed some spectacular visual effects. And that's what it's all about in this film.","10/10"
"rubya","23 October 2017","I enjoyed the first two films of the latest Planet of the Apes 'series' so I went in thinking it was going to be good without reading any reviews first.It started well enough for a 'war' film but things just went downhill from there. The pace was too slow, the plot extremely weak, a lot of things didn't make sense. It felt like a 5 hour film and I have to admit I dozed off once I was so bored.As others have mentioned in their reviews, there's a girl who doesn't seem to care her dad was killed but cries when an ape she's known for like a day dies. A gorilla who in some scenes is about the same size as a chimpanzee and then riding a horse like it weighs nothing. Then you have a soldier camp manned by a bunch of amateurs who are of course all dressed in dark clothing because they're the bad guys, and get attacked by guys in white cameo who are obviously the good guys, it's not just for the snow, like it's Star Wars and we need the point to be spelled out. Missiles fly everywhere, hitting groups of soldiers rather than the massive fuel tank in the middle of the camp. Then the whole entire ""white"" army just runs up to the camp like storm troopers to conveniently get entirely buried by an avalanche. The end.This film is trying to explain things from the 1968 film but without any imagination. Why wouldn't Caesar try to work out why humans are going mute, could this be a tactical advantage? Rather than a war, with apes taking over humans, he seems to just want his apes to be left alone in a small area so how they end up ruling the planet, I don't know.I only gave 4 stars for the CGI.","10/10"
"rudypen1216","17 July 2017","I honestly can't wait for this movie to come to blu ray. A film about love, bravery, sacrifice, loss, and pain. The acting and CGI are well done, so is the story. I couldn't ask for a trilogy better than this franchise. I don't know if it ends here. But the way the movie ends I see no point of another sequel. This whole trilogy was pure genius and hard worked. This is my favorite movie in the trilogy!","8/10"
"ruelshepperd","3 June 2023","Into The Spider-Verse was one of the best superhero movies and animated movies ever made, certainly the strongest Spider-Man movie we've had to date. Until now. Across The Spider-Verse takes all what was great about its predecessor and turns it up to 11, creating what is possibly the best animated movie ever.The animation in this film is next level. The style has evolved since the last film with not only the comic-style but many different styles encompassing different versions of Spider-Man and it all flows together marvellously. Every frame is literally an excellently constructed painting. This aids in the absolutely stunning and immensely creative action sequences, some of the best I've ever seen.The story is once again fantastic. With all this multiversal madness, the writers put Miles' story front and centre. His arc is remarkable and Shameik Moore continues to be the definitive version of the character. Every voice actor does an incredible job, especially Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Every moment of the pair together is wonderful. There is so much going on character-wise and Miles' personal journey has the potential to be the best Spider-Man story arc we've gotten in movie form.Being a big crossover, there are moments of fan service but they're never dwelt upon, the plot and characters remain the focus. If there were any problems to bring up it would be that the main antagonist for the first half of the film disappears for the rest of the film but the villain is still good and is clearly going to be more prevalent in the next film. There is still very strong emotional conflict without him as strong character ideals become the main source of conflict for the rest of the film.Overall, this film should be a 10/10 but because of its place as the first of a two-parter, the second part must stick the landing for it all to be worth it. However, I have immense faith in the filmmakers to pull it off because of the immense quality of this film. It exceeds in all aspects of filmmaking. A must-see for everyone!","10/10"
"rueryuzakil","1 February 2019","As far as the Dragon Ball movie criteria goes, Dragon Ball Super Broly fits it pretty well. The fight scenes are fast-paced, climactic and very impressive, and we are shown certain things we've never witnessed before in this franchise. There are plenty of comic relief moments strewn throughout the film, far more than I personally expected, which ended up being a double-edged sword for me.It's difficult to give a spoiler free review, so the oncoming things may(?) be spoilers? So proceed at your own risk.Some of the comedy seemed very out of place to me. Some of them were intimately intertwined with the premise(like Frieza's wish) and just seemed unnecessary to me because it removed the long-term tension(the tension outside of fights). There were some cases of out-of-character moments, at least to me. Another one, and I'm probably nitpicking here, is an aspect of the animation, the character's micro expressions. The new style is amazing and very fluid, but the characters seem to gesticulate too much in a typical anime manner which just makes them look comical and unrealistic. It's like the animators are doing their best to showboat.Characters who were heavily promoted barely show up at all. This includes the likes of Beerus, Goten, Trunks, Paragus and Whis. You shouldn't expect any action from Beerus, who remains grossly underappreciated, and Gotenks, who doesn't show up at all.Now, the story. It is far inferior to its two predecessors. Plot holes, premature character development and power inconsistencies are all there. Some might even be considered copouts. Fight scenes are the driving strengths of this movie.However, Broly, himself, is a very good character. Believe me, I absolutely despised the original Broly and was sick of his notoriety in the fan base, but this new, canon rendition is a much, much better change of pace. Even if you haven't seen the old movies, I have a feeling you're likely to take a liking to him.Finally, this movie tries hard to emulate the ones bearing the old renditions of the new characters. Fusion Reborn, Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan and Bardock, the Father of Goku. While it succeeds in a few scenes, the rest are just painful. Especially if you haven't seen the three above mentioned, these moments will just seem pointless to you. As for voice acting, the staple DB cast does a great job as always, while Vic Mignogna makes a triumphant return as Broly, breathing new life into the character.Now, that's my review. Had I not watched all five trailers, the three classics or expected a stronger story, I might have given this movie a slightly higher ranking. However, it would not have made my Top 10 Dragon Ball movies list.","10/10"

"ruskin-462-304151","23 August 2017","I see a lot of so-so movies but this one is genuinely awful. The only thing good about it is that now I know not to trust Rotten Tomatoes which gave it an aggregate of 93% which is dumbfounding. There is no way to begin to count the ways that this movie sucked. Too long, stupid stupid impossible situations with no attempt at explaining how these preposterous events could actually happen. And on top of that dripping with syrupy sentimentality (Apes with sweet, no sad, but caring tears in their eyes)... And on top of all that the effects were not as good as the first movie which I was astounded by. The movement was just off (watch the rock hefting scenes more carefully; the rocks clearly weighed about 2 ounces each).Sure, I already suspended my disbelief that we got talking apes taking over the planet, and yes I loved ALL of the original 5 movies for their camp and charm. This dud has none of it.","1/10"
"russellquisenberry","4 June 2023","15/10!!!! Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece not just for superhero movies and animated movies, but cinema itself!! The Empire Strikes Back meets The Dark Knight of animated sequels!! The story is more dramatic and emotional than I thought. The animation is beautiful, mixing all sorts of animation styles like computer animated, hand drawn, comic book, etc. The voice acting is stellar, especially Shamiek Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, and Oscar Isacc!!! My favorite superhero movie I've seen in a long time. Dear Academy, don't just give this the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but also a nomination for Best Picture!!!! Go see this immediately!!!!","10/10"
"RussHog","1 July 2023","Indiana Jones 5 sucked. It's not as offensive as the fourth one, but in a way...it's worse. Like how Disney Star Wars sequels are worse than the shockingly incoherent prequels. The opening scene is kinda cool and is the only part of the movie that feels like a classic Indiana Jones film. It might be worth it just to see the opening scene but that is about it.The biggest problem with the film is the co-star is so annoying and Indiana Jones becomes a second fiddle sidekick in his own movie - and he loses all of the spark that made him such an incredible hero in the first three films. This really should have had Shorty from Temple of Doom and it might have sucked less.Really, between aliens and time travel - I don't know how much more you can mess up a franchise that so beautifully made the ancient cultures of the world so mysterious and powerful - and they were truly the stars of the film.I'm glad Indy got one final film that isn't Crystal Skull, I'm just sorry that it had to be The Dial of Destiny.","6/10"
"RussHog","17 February 2023","I went into this with low expectations but ended up enjoying it. It's not a perfect film, but it doesn't suck. The story is that Ant Man and The Wasp enter a micro-world known as the Quantum Realm and encounter a trapped universe conquerer named Kang who wants to escape and unleash his wrath on all known reality. The world building is a lot of fun, the characters are pretty cool, and in the end the action is well done. The actor who plays Kang does a good job not to overplay the role and is a pretty solid villain. (Something the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't really have a lot of is good villains.) This movie has lots of action, some memorable lines, and it's never preachy. A fun superhero movie with a cool villain.","7/10"
"rutzelb","29 October 2017","Caesar (Andy Serkis) believes his clan must leave the Woods and go to the Desert where they will be safe from the Army. But he won't accompany them until he kills the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) who killed his wife and son.This is nothing short of a masterpiece and I don't say that lightly. The acting, stunts, CGI and cinematography are all outstanding. Two things: Andy Serkis must be nominated for Best Actor and, of course, so should Woody Harrelson as anytime he is in a movie, the Academy should automatically award him a Best Actor Award as he is that good whether in a comedy or in a drama. And, yes, the movie itself should be nominated for Best Picture and the Director for Best Director. Hey, this is an epic movie and the music says so too. So there!This is not all Ape against Ape and the Army. Well, it is but the fighting is not as prevalent as most would think. The powers that be saw that constant fighting is not the answer to a good movie. And so it is. A breath of fresh air is the little girl (Amiah Miller) Caesar finds on his way to find the Colonel. She is named Nova after a Chevy Nova logo. She doesn't talk and we don't know the reason for that. Caesar's men shot dead her father or her guardian as we don't know exactly who he was. A very strange scene has her looking at her dead father or guardian with no emotion at all. However, later on she will get to you and you may need that box of Kleenex. A sort of comic relief is Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) who is against any decision by Caesar and his men, but eventually he always gives in. His scenes would have been funnier had the Director stretched out his misgivings because he was that good. Ah, well, we can't have everything. The supporting cast is impeccable. Maurice (Karin Konoval) is Caesar's chief confidant; Red Donkey (Ty Olsson) is a chief enforcer for the Colonel; and Toby Kebbel as Koba who is only seen in Caesar's visions or dreams – if you remember, Koba is the more aggressive Ape who was constantly against Caesar. All in all this is a very satisfying movie and I didn't want it to end (Even though it was a little too long?) (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Langjuage: No. Rating: A","1/10"
"ruzik00","7 July 2020","The movie is not a 10 but there are too many 1 star ratings the movie is realistic a 8-8.5

"rxhuang-26790","17 July 2017","I was so tempted to walk out of this move after the first ten minutes. I stayed because I was with a group of friends. The plot is stupid. You literally feel no emotions for anything going on in the movie. The only feeling you get is boredom. The incoherence in the movie was unbearable . The movie tries really hard to humanize the apes to the point you feel like you are watching a day time soap opera through most of the film and not even a good one either. This movie was torture. If they need to interrogate criminals or terrorists make them watch War for the Planet of the Apes.","10/10"
"ryan-60325","23 January 2024","I went into this fully expecting to enjoy a bad movie. It is so, so much worse than that. Its two redeeming qualities are a ruthlessly unflattering portrayal of crypto bros and an embedded decent PSA about computer support scams. Everything else is just brutal, and it gets worse the farther it gets into the run time. My generous suspension of disbelief could not cope with the later action scenes. There are no exciting plans being executed (you know, the kind that would never work in practice but are fun to watch); it's all one guy going through the motions of the same forgettable fight scene over and over. Two throwaway ""getting in"" moments, at best. If anything in the story was supposed to be a twist, it had zero impact. The experience is kind of like watching someone else speedrun a video game on Very Easy mode, taking advantage of the fact that enemies despawn when not in camera view. The key mysterious organization is barely explained and conveniently waved away at the halfway mark, but not barely enough to avoid forming a really, really dumb outline.Doesn't lean into the cheesy bee thing enough to be hilariously terrible, although it's clear that they tried somewhat. In the end, it's just regular, boring terrible.","7/10"

"ryanculp-95641","12 January 2024","I don't understand those saying the plot is weak, if you have any relatives who have been scammed or know about call centers and scammers you would know they are a prevalent problem in real life and now in this movie.The only person who ever cared for him was scammed of their life savings and the charity that they ran causing them to kill themselves over making such a mistake and losing everything. Therefore leading Jason on a rampage to go through call centers and make his way up to the top of the ""beehive"" and shut the hole operation down.The action in this movie was spectacular. There were some gruesome scenes at some points with fingers being chopped off, soldiers being hung from ceilings, the camera shots were low and moving so you could see blood splatter when enemies were shot in the head. Overall, the action in this film from gun combat and hand to hand combat is phenomenal and on par with John Wick.Rating: 10/10.","6/10"
"ryanmo-35178","11 March 2023","Waited for long to watch ant man again, but how come I am so disappointed? Ant man was the most unnoticed hero in the avengers, and he is still one in this movie. The story is most about the hidden adventure of Michelle, and to evolve the next big boss (Kang), how come the plot become so unrealistic? I was so bored in the middle and wanna the movie to finish asap. The fighting scenes are not attractive and the big boss is so weak (even I know there are so many replicates of him at last). Cannot think too much good things Inside (except his pretty gal and the funny telepathy man). Really hope the plot can be better and the next universe can become better.

The action scenes are not bad but all his enemies seemed to be standing around and acted in slow motion and waited to be hit and killed! Even the final big guy is also hit with ease.

"ryanpersaud-59415","12 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is quite possibly the best sequel I've seen in a LONG time.It not only expands upon the original, but represents an improvement in almost every way. By the way, the original is an excellent, 9/10 film too, so...yeah, this is heavy, heavy praise] The visuals are absolutely STUNNING, so much so that multiple times whilst watching this movie, I thought to myself ""how is this even possible?"" I can't recall the last time a live action movie really made me feel that way. The commitment to comic book aesthetic is incredible and lovingly crafted in each frame; but what's more impressive is that this film has the ambition to go beyond even that: blending 3D animation with live action, 2D animated with 3D, mosaics with moving rotoscoped characters. I can honestly say that I feel lucky to be able to watch films in the 2020s, Across the Spider-Verse represents one of the best examples of technology and artistry coming together to make something unbelievably cool.And, the amazing thing is that all of this visual excellence exists in service of a great story. Narratively, Across the Spider-Verse represents a more mature, high stakes, thoughtful, well constructed instalment of the franchise; the characters are relatable and understandable, their motivations clear as day. There's a real humanity to the story, despite the bombast and multiversal storytelling. At its core, its about family, identity, self-discovery, community...universal themes that anyone could get behind. There are also so many genuinely great performances bringing these characters to life; shout out in particular to Daniel Kaluuya and Oscar Isaac, but honestly, the whole cast is great. They're so good that if you told me the voice actors sat down with the animators and saw what they were supposed to look and move like, I'd believe you.Speaking of movement, the action sequences in this film are truly incredible. The fluidity of the characters' movements, the fantastic editing and use of comic book panels (a really valuable tool to ensure everything can be seen), and aforementioned excellent visual effects stack up with the best live action scenes Hollywood has to offer.I also personally believe a superhero tale is only as good as its villain, and wow, this movie did a fantastic job. I love how Spot (played by the excellent Jason Schwartzmann) initially comes off as a joke, only for his true potential (and power) to slowly be revealed throughout the movie. I kind of wish he was in it longer, but Oscar Isaac's Miguel works as another amazing antagonist as well.And the ENDING. MY GOD. Could this movie have set its sequel up even better? My wife and I were sitting in the theatre, ready for another half hour or so, expecting the climax only to realize when the music began to swell that it was over. I was genuinely so impressed with how well the filmmakers put all the chess pieces on the board for the next one. However, because of that, if there was one thing keeping this movie from being perfect to me, it's that the ending isn't here yet. It still feels like half of a movie, so how this movie really stacks up in the grand scheme of things is unknown until Part II.Into the Spider-Verse represented a revolution in American animation, where the Pixar style commitment to replicating the real world was eschewed in favour of fluid, unapologetic, stylized animation (so much so that Pixar itself is copying Sony Pictures Animation). I feel like Across the Spider-Verse is throwing the gauntlet, passionately arguing that animation could and SHOULD be taken as seriously as live action.","10/10"
"ryanwesthamfan","3 June 2023","Quite simply perfection. This movie does not disappoint whatsoever. I've been hyped for this film ever since that first trailer dropped and it was worth the wait. The visuals are even better than the first one (which I didn't think was even possible) it is quite simply a groundbreaking film and the way that it is able to explore spider man in a way you can only do in animation. It is very rare you get sequels these days that are able to be even better than the original but this film definitely does that.Overall Thoughts- This film is a much watch. Stop what you're doing right now go to the cinema and watch this film because it is a masterpiece in every single way and I think I will only love this film even more on rewatch. Overall I'm going to give Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse an easy 10/10.","9/10"
"ryanwgordon","3 February 2024","I have watched a lot of bad movies these days. I may be on the minority, but I actually even thought John Wick 4 was overrated. The bullet proof jackets were a bit of overkill. Expendables 4 was so bad, that I can barely remember what happened in most of the movie. But this one I actually enjoyed. Could the writing have been a lot better, sure. But I didn't put this movie on hoping for an Oscar award winning movie. My only gripe is that the ending was a bit anti climatic for me. They could have written it a bit better. Overall, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again with my wife if she can stay awake long enough for it.","8/10"
"ryfin","8 November 2021","I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","10/10"
"ryzah","11 July 2017","I am a biased lover of 'Planet of the Apes'... Take these words with that it mind!This is without doubt, the best 'trilogy' of the 21st Century!From the opening scene, leading from a recap of past films in an imaginative and flowing manner, you are led back into this beloved new world along side friend or foe?! The ensuing drama that you are then taken along with, is breathtaking, shocking, brutal and Brave! Andy Serkis and the other Actors who have mastered this unbelievable technology are magnificent, the Visuals are stunning, the shocks are unbearable, gripping and wonderfully woven into the faultless story, that grabs you, holds you and then breaks you over and over again! Naivety aside, I understand a few issues may arise, such as 'Bad Ape', the Music being a little obvious, the Little girls reactions to a couple of dramatic scenes, however none are big enough to spoil in any way a quite remarkable end to a series that has become a huge hit. Ignore those reviews that typically focus on such minor detail.So, go back and watch the Rise and Dawn of the Apes if you haven't already done so; Grab snacks and drinks, Book the film in 3D, ""Shut off from the outside world"" as 'VUE' states and witness a Masterpiece.","8/10"
"s_pablo","25 April 2019","No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good...","8/10"

There is a lot of action, good fighting scenes and a hero, who does not want to be one, just as it should be. Jason Statham does a great job, he fights for those who can't stand up for themselves and in the end he gets the mastermind.","6/10"
"s3276169","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.","9/10"
"sabian-11667","9 March 2023","This movie was just fun. I'm actually more excited on what this means for the MCU moving forward!!! Don't believe all the bad reviews this movie has been getting I enjoyed it a lot! Let me first say the way I judge sequels is by the villain the first movies are by the main characters but once you start to go deeper into the characters life villains are usually what pop. I loved the first ant-man very funny exciting kind of heist movie. The second tho i didn't care for cause o felt the villain could have been a lot better. Which brings us to this movie. Jonathon Majors steals the show as Kang. He is more deep then we expect. Although this movie kind of lacked the laughs of the first 2 it holds up well. I highly recommend this movie.","5/10"
"Sabre-El","8 December 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes picks up from where the previous two movies had left: the intelligent apes are increasing in numbers and the humans are afraid of them. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the first installment, was a masterful piece of art. It mainly focused on two characters, Caesar, the protagonist of this movie, and his 'keeper'/friend. It was very detailed, focussing on the relationship between the two and all that fit well with how the narrative unfolded. The second installment had a similar formula of keeping the story detailed and it worked well for it was well.That's why I had a lot of hope for this movie. Unfortunately, that very formula that made me love the previous parts, just doesn't work with this one. War of the Planet of the Apes starts out just fine, but then, just in a few minutes, the story slows down a lot: each scene is very detailed, trying to give its viewers a feel of its characters. The thing is, we already know about many characters from its previous parts, so we're not that interested about that any more. Many apes haven't developed speech, so most of the movie is in sign language. While it is 'realistic' and I give plaudits to the makers for this, it adds to the slowness of the movie, making it boring, as one just can't understand what's going on. On top of all that, the movie is quite predictable. Add up all these factors and the fact that the movie runs for more than 2 hours, it becomes slightly difficult to watch. I literally had to fast forward a few scenes because I just wanted the movie to end.All that said, the movie does have its positives. The CGI is amazing and the apes really look as if they exist. The movie might be boring, but it is still a good piece of art in terms of story-telling and one can tell a lot of effort went into it.\Recommendation: don't watch it if you can't stand slow movies and don't have your hopes up based on the previous two installments","9/10"
"sabujsheikhsb","23 April 2023","Avengers: Endgame is simply the most marvelous superhero film ever made. This epic cinematic masterpiece from the Marvel Studios is undoubtedly the greatest achievement in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by the Russo brothers, this movie is the culmination of more than a decade of storytelling that is both thrilling and emotional. The excellent cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson, gives an outstanding performance, ensuring that the emotional core of this film is as strong as its action sequences. The film's pacing is perfect, and the storyline is outstanding, with engaging and thrilling twists and turns that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout its runtime. The visual effects are also exceptional, with outstanding action sequences that are both intense and awe-inspiring. In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is an epic and satisfying conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that is deserving of its spot as the highest-grossing film of all time. A perfect 10/10 rating is without a doubt, given to this phenomenal film.","6/10"
"sachin-jhunjhun","1 July 2023","No character build up, random unbelievable action scenes .. that lengthy rickshaw scene in Morocco was one of the worst unreal action sequences I have ever seen and almost felt cartoonish where they fall off stairs, buildings, hit cars, dodger bullets etc without any sense of realism and you know nothing will happen to them. Characters jump from one location to another without any logic.. The main villain/nazi in the movie is stranded on a boat by Indie who seemingly can drive from Morocco to Italy in a small motor boat and the villain just uses his binoculars to see that Indie who was supposed to be going to particular country in Europe is going to another city in Italy.. absolute drivel!

""Into the spider-verse"" put itself in such height with every possible parameters like story-line, character buildup, animation style etc and of course the music!Before watching ""across the spider-verse"", I was confident that, this one will at most come close to the first one, AT MOST...
But boy, was I wrong!! Without leaking any (probably!) spoilers, I'll say just this one thing. I watched about 4/5k movies plus TV shows at least. And I never gladly accepted a show/ movie which ended with a cliffhanger, actually hated them. But this one will remain the SINGULAR exception. And I'll be eagerly waiting for ""beyond the spider-verse"".And the last two songs (self love and am I dreaming) hit really hard, specially after watching the movie at one go.

"SafReviews","29 September 2023","The movie was a bit better than I expected because it did start off well with Indiana once again up against the Germans in the third reich time period, but for me that was where the movie peaked as the story became less interesting as it went on. The movie did become a bit more intriguing when they time travelled back to the Roman empire time period which was kind of cool to see, but the damage was already done as most of the movie was just generic. I also wasn't a fan of the character Helena who I felt was unreliable and unlikeable. I even didn't like Teddy as I felt he wasn't charismatic enough and felt like he wasn't needed in the story. On the plus side at least it was better than the Crystal Skull.","2/10"

People are saying the plot is just like any other Marvel movie plot and they might be right, but I wasn't bored with the story or find it similar to any other Marvel movie that I've seen before. The action scenes were good just as you would expect from a Marvel movie. I thought the bad guy Kang was good and felt like unique bad guy, but he might not be in any more movies as expected because the actor is probably going to cancelled for abuse.","6/10"
"saghy122","25 September 2020","There were things I liked a lot and some that I didn't. I enjoyed the story on planet Vegeta, the scenes with Bardock, etc., I really want to see more stuff about the average saiyans who are not the protagonists. The animation was beautiful, but the whole fight with Broly was kinda boring and it didn't have any weight at all. I miss those brutal injuries from Dragon Ball that horrified me as a kid, but they were neccessary because you knew the fighters really pushed themselves to their limits. Now there's just punches, kicks and more punches and while they sure look good on the screen, I just couldn't take the whole thing serious. The soundtrack was very cringy, it tries to be cool soo hard, but it's really just bloody awful. I think the old DBZ Broly is far superior to DBS Broly, I liked his character a lot more too in DBZ. He was just an uncontrollable embodiment of rage, which was truly terrifying, DBS Broly is not that scary at all. Overall, I think this movie is very overhyped, it had all those things I didn't like in the DBS series, and I really wish they could just go back to the roots, before super saiyan was even a thing.","10/10"
"sagoth66","17 January 2024","Don't you just love it when the really bad guys who you instantly hate get their asses kicked? It runs through the whole of this film with a modern and very relevant antagonist. They storyline of course is less believable in places but if you just want a good old fashioned action flick like some suggest a throwback to those in the 80's and 90's here it is. Films are meant to bring emotion, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the cinema gave a little virtual fist pump as each odious baddie got their comeuppance.I titled this as 'much better than I expected' because the trailer came across like some sort of parody action film, yes the bee reference is a little comical at times but I think it fits, and overall if action is your thing like John Wick you'll leave the cinema with a sile on your face.","10/10"

Once again incredible voice-acting and writing, focusing on the core family bonds and how each spiderman's destiny and story correlate. The Villain ""Spot"" also is given his own unique journey.

With the rise of AI especially, the chances for schemes like the ones depicted in this film is quite valid and scary, but the idea that someone like Jason Statham just living his life in peace and trying to be a regular guy who is forced to the call of action via a horrible scenario that is deeply thought out and downright corrupt and wretch makes the movie suck you in and keep ahold to the very end. I think this is one everyone should see, especially as we see the increasing changes to life due to schematic fraud and those seeking to capitalize off innocent hardworking people in the most nefarious of ways.","9/10"
"saimazaidi","14 December 2018",""" THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW""
Review:-
This is an absolute gem of a movie. Modern Dragon ball can't get any better than this. It was really phenomenol.
Here a few key features of the movie
(i) PLOT :
The movie is divided into 2 phases. The ""Past&The Present"". The start of the movie is all about the history of the saiyans. The movie does a half an hour long depiction of the history of the saiyans. The past is mostly based off ""DB MINUS"" with a few tid bits from the ""Bardock: The Father of Goku"".
The movie is more about broly. Broly was a saiyan with really high potential. King vegeta being jealous of broly's latent potential decided to send away baby broly to a far away planet ""Vampa"". Paragus(Father of broly) being betrayed by The King, vowed to find his son and one day get revenge on the king.
The movie explains about the ties of fate between Goku, Vegeta and Broly.
The present section of the movie takes place after ""THE TOURNAMENT OF POWER"". Its about the encounter of the 3 fated saiyans with each other.
Pretty simple plot not too complex or anythig but is really well written and executed pretty well!(ii) ANIMATION:
The animation of this movie is out of this world. Toriyama and Toei Animation decided to change the animation supervisor and character designer ""Tadayoshi Yamamuro"" to ""Nahiro Shinatni"". His animation is more fluid and gives a refreshing feel to the movie.
There is a use of CG as well. In short this is the best anime movie of 2018 when it comes to animation.
Having animators from My hero academia, one punch man etc working on it. Also got Toei's best staff with the likes of Naotoshi Shida, Yuya Takahashi, Naoki tate and other great animators.
The movie is a one hour and fourty minutes of pure "" SAGAKA"".(iii) MUSIC AND DIRECTION
Movie director is ""Nagamine"" who produced one of the best episodes of super like episode 95 or the introduction of Ultra Instinct etc.
The movie is directed really well by him. His story boards were really amazing.
The music is composed by "" Sumitomo"" who had his fair share of criticism from the fans because of his music in the beginning of super. His music in battle of gods was pretty good but in this movie its so emotional and captivating.
(iv) FIGHT SCENES:Dragon Ball is known for producing some of the best fights in all of anime. And this movie is no exception. With the likes of takahashi and Naotoshi shida handling the main action parts of the film, the fight scenes are absolutely mind blowing. Especially the final section of the movie where Shida brings his A game to the movie, shida mixed with Shinatni sheets produced some of the best fights in all of anime.(v) PROBLEMS:
Nothing is perfect and Dragon ball Super broly also had some tiny problems as well.
1. RUSHING: Sometimes the movie felt a bit rushed. Mainly because the original script of the movie was actually 3hours long so they had to narrow it down to 1 hour 40 minutes.That is why some sections are abit rushed but its not that big of a deal.
2.Lack of Tension : THE movie lacked tension as compared to the days of dbz. But still its just a tiny problem not that big of deal to ruin a movie.
3.Retcons :
There were a few retcons here and there. but i can ignore such retcons as they don't seem that big to me.(VI) CONCLUSION:
You should absolutely watch this movie.
Not only its animated really well ,it show case some of the best fights of 2018, and it has great music too. Please go and watching this movie in the theatres. Its theatrical experience will blow your mind.
Overall its a pretty solid movie.
9/10 for me !!!","10/10"
"saint_brett","29 June 2023","""Destiny of Doom"" is a jumbled mess like eggs mixed with jelly crystals and corn flour. It starts out with the standard Nazi Stormtroopers who have captured a CGI Indiana Jones, and it quickly descends from there and begins to ball and chain the viewer from all the corn flour that's coagulated around your ankles.If you've got a choc top in your hand in the cinema, you better hurry up and eat it quickly, or else it'll melt as the movie runs like a Boston marathon. Careful you don't get deep knee thrombosis from sitting down too long.In an attempt to revive a pulse in the plot, they fall back on the tried and tested chase scenes to build movie momentum, from songthaews to speeder bikes, cars and a ""Solo"" train chase scene. The movie tries to emulate ""Super Mario Brothers"" with all the carting around while defying gravity with no cohesion and a plot that jumps all over the shop.The ending wasn't explained properly, as the villain wanted to kill Hitler, but he was secretly a star-struck fanboy who idolized him at the same time. I guess the ending is confused, as word on the street is that there were numerous reshoots that only wrapped up a couple of months ago.There's no point using the retro characters in ""Destiny of Doom,"" as they only have cameo roles to play and last about as long as you eat your choc top.Ford looks like a tanned piece of leather who's fighting a losing battle in the moisturization stakes. They use CGI to make him look younger, but he just comes across as looking like an Ed Gein victim who has been patched up with fish skin and wax and walking around like a Terminator endoskeleton. He should do a whole Madonna makeover and go to extremes to retain that eternal look of youth.That's what the next movie should be called, ""Indiana Jones and The Eternal Quest for the Fountain Of Youth."" He goes back in time to find the formula to remain young and has to steal pages from Estee Lauder and Neutrogena. Jamie Lee Curtis can join him as they're no longer marketable in Hollywood anymore.The T-800 was made out to be an apron-wearing furniture salesman in the last ""Herminator"" movie. It's a wonder Indy wasn't a typing receptionist for a women's law firm in this like Hemsworth in ""Ghostbusters.""Snarky Fleabag plays a con woman who's motivated by greed and deception and is not suited for the role as an adventure character. So, she wants to travel back in time to steal artifacts and claims that they should be preserved or sent back to their rightful owners, but she secretly wants to sell them to the highest bidder. She's known for her acting in some ""Fleabag"" TV show that's based on comedy, but all her attempts at humor in this make her out to be a typical modern-day stooge who's bred from Hollywood's standard stock ranks of robots and stiff power girls who pledge their allegiance to Left-Wing practices and follow She-Ra: Princess of Power principles.They should have cast Brie Larson in this instead of what's-her-name where she could have played the daughter of Elsa who was out to avenge her mother's death and held Indiana Jones responsible. Imagine the female empowerment Larson would have brought to the table.The CGI is outdated old format from 1993, and I love how the characters have Marty McFly's button on their clothes and can dry off in seconds.After being punched out by Fleabag, Indiana Jones returns to his senses and the film ends with Indy's hat hanging outside an apartment door. As the screen closes out, Indy grabs it as if to claim his rightful title back, as the original plot, by Kathleen Kennedy, had Fleabag assuming the role and actually becoming Indiana Jones after they killed him off. (Did we just dodge a bunch of Indiana Jones movies starring a female lead?)Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm must never work on another ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"" project ever again. You've destroyed the legend and legacy of both these franchises... that I no longer care for.Congratulations, Kennedy, you got what you set out to achieve and have sunk both franchises to a pit of despair and apathy. If Kathleen Kennedy became the owner of a basketball club, they'd fold within a year and be relegated to a Canadian division.Angelina Jolie's ""Tomb Raider"" was the Indiana Jones for women. Wasn't that enough? Now Kennedy has to emasculate Ford's character and had original intentions of replacing him with the British actress for future projects.And Bob Iger continues to give her a golden handshake?""Destiny of Doom"" runs so long that your ice cream melts, your popcorn blue molds, and you start growing weeds and roots in your cinema seat. Not to mention how boring it is.","5/10"
"sairajs407","18 December 2018","The movie is Awesome. Although the fight was very fast, but this is a movie and a Series is yet to come for which i can hardly wait.
Spectacular Ending. Yet again SON GOKU made a friend and Formidable rival.
Being able to watch this movie on time, best day ever for this year.","10/10"
"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","21 December 2018","Well, this movie is pretty logical and I'm glad they are taking this stuff seriously. There were some confusing things but they were pretty much explained.
It is clear why Goku's parents did not leave to Earth with him (enemy would sense them). It is clear what was happening during the hour when Gogeta was in bad shape (Whis was distracting Broly).The only question I have is why Goku didn't use SSB Kaio Ken x20, but probably he didn't want to break his body because thought that will not help.It's cool that Gogeta used the mastered version of SSB transformation.
It is good that Vegeta pretty much received as much attention as Goku.
I'm glad that they didn't make Broly extremely strong and he actually easily lost to Gogeta, because power levels are getting out of hand now. But if you give them time it's ok. I just wonder what's gonna happen with Broly? We will have now 3 main characters, wtf? Even Vegeta did not get his shine yet, Goku always gets everything first.The only reason I give this 8/10 is because I was lacking overwhelming emotions. The strongest emotion I had was when Broly attacked Vegeta and Vegeta smiled. I was like ""omg, that's my man Vegeta!"". Also there were a few nice emotional moments from the past of Goku.","10/10"

"sajakram","14 June 2019","I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.","7/10"
"Sakaresm","6 September 2023","To be fair, after reading some reviews and hearing about the generally mediocre reception, I had my expectations pretty low. Nevertheless, I liked it! It's not a masterpiece, but definitely better than Crystal Skull.The best thing is that it definitely feels like an Indiana Jones movie; all the action, the story, and the subtle jokes and humor is exactly on the spot! The director clearly had done his homework. Helena's character could have been better, but nothing that would have ruined the movie. It wasn't bad, per se, but there just wasn't that ""something"" that I cannot even directly point at. Mads Mikkelsen as the evil Nazi was great! He is such a great actor and the character was good, too. Even if a bit stereotypical evil bad guy, but that's pretty much what to expect from a movie like this.I'd say the negative thing about the movie was -- a bit ironically -- that it's even a bit too much Indiana Jones. The story and plot was a bit too familiar and predictable, and the characters were nothing unexpected. It felt a tad too much like just a fan service for the fans and it didn't even try to come up with something new. But maybe that's exactly what we needed for a farewell for this franchise. I feel good about leaving Indy into his rest now.(Although, I wouldn't turn down some prequel story with someone new as Indy. Just don't overdo it. Maybe some low key adventure/mystery TV-series, but maybe no more big blockbuster theatrical action movies.)","7/10"
"salinaqvi","15 January 2020","This is without a doubt, the best dragon ball film and one of the best anime films ever. From its excellent animation and action to the surprisingly good story, this is an absolute joy to watch for dragon ball and shonen fans alike. A must see.","10/10"
"salirocket","8 May 2019","Don't trust the highest scores, trust the bad review. It's waste three hours film and bad storyline (not make any sense and confused). I don't understand why people likes it, I didn't cry or laugh but felt sleepy.Here are the few things that I don't like the movie
1. Too many superheroes against baby Thanos.
2. Timeline - That is cheating and all the superheroes stills lose.
3. It's not an action film, it more likes drama/sci-fi film.
4. Natasha (black widow) didn't have to die, she should uses Red skull.
5. Thor and Hulk are lazy and they are no need to be in the film and possibly the other superheroes.
6. What is Rocket doing? Why did he need to travel in time?
7. Ironman didn't have to put the glove on but use the remote control to snap the finger.I can't think of what else to write here but if you want to watch this, it's better to wait for rental dvd/digital to save your money.","9/10"
"SamALMan","21 August 2018","I can't watch this enjoyable movie without mentioning how amazing the CGI and the special effects.. for the story line it is expected some how but still enjoyable and I can re-watch it again.When I watched this movie, I understood that time passed from the first movie and second movie of this series but it wasn't clear how long it passes.. this movie could be a step to explain a little why humans were captured in the original movie planet of the apes (1968).The ""war"" is indeed for the ""planet of the apes"".","7/10"
"SamALMan","9 May 2018","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","4/10"
"samhinchliffe-70241","8 July 2023","The ending is awful. I was expecting him to put his hat on the kid or at least go back and save his son with the dial. I thought this was the whole point when he said he would go back and save his son. I mean given the chance why the hell wouldn't you save your son? It is probably because Shia Labeouf was his son and he won't do another and regrets doing Crystal skull. They could have cast somebody else maybe, but that's obviously the reason. The thing is disney love to make more films just look at Star Wars. There's money to be made from Indianna Jones. So I thought this would have been passing the torch but it wasn't.Also the lead actress I couldn't stand her. Her demeanour and look was more of a villain than a hero. Plus for 9/10 of the movie she was kind of villain with the way she acted. The bad guy was brilliantly cast.Started off brilliantly, then slowly got worse as the film went on. Worth a watch don't get me wrong. But it could have been so much better. They had a time machine, and hardly used it!","6/10"
"samsanyb","6 June 2023","Possibly as close as we can get to spider-man 2 or the dark knight. This film has everything you need, it has the drama, the emotion, the action, the jokes, the cinematic elements, the twisted plots.. it just looks and feels like nothing you've ever seen before. Like I mentioned in the title! The film made me want to watch it for 3 times and never get bored one single bit. That is how you know it's a great movie. In fact i have not had an awesome time like that since Infinity war or no way home. It just delivers! It's a film for everyone out there. So go ahead and enjoy it yourselves! And make your own opinion. Let's hope when the actual Miles Morales's movie will come out, it will turn out to be exactly like this version of him. We need more of that!","9/10"
"samslapson","12 June 2023","This movie is genuinely the greatest Marvel Movie I've watched in a long time. Now, admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of marvel movies in general, but I do know that the ones that I've watched, couldn't even come close to the masterpiece that is this movie. The jokes were funny, the serious parts were amazing and made sense, and the designs of the characters are the most creative designs I've ever seen in any animated movie. The villain of the movie is also very interesting, and along with having a comedic backstory along with bouncing off of the rest of the spider-mens humor, is scary and serious. Amazing movie overall, and I'm very excited to see Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse Part 2.","10/10"
"SAMTHEBESTEST","17 January 2024","The Beekeeper (2024) :
Movie Review :David Ayer directs Jason Statham in an action-packed drama, The Beekeeper. This title has a sweet meaning, but I dare you call this film or the Beekeeper's character sweet. That's sour and spicy, for sure. Jason Statham has done popular action films like Transporter, The Italian Job (a thriller), The Mechanic, The Expendables, and Fast & Furious movies, but has struggled a bit in the recent past. The Beekeeper is an answer to that struggle, maybe. We all know plenty of kick assss action movies, but John Wick has that universal recognition like no other film when it comes to the pure, mad action genre in this millenium. The Beekeeper might just be that John Wick kind of chapter in Jason's book. This is not an exaggeration, but a comparative statement, and don't misread ""might be"" as ""is"". It's an arguable statement to avoid direct comparisons and fan wars.Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher who has never done a bad thing in her life and has devoted her time to charity, is scammed by a huge online racket. Devasted, she commits suicide. Adam Clay (Jason Statham), a beekeeper working at a garage, shared a good bond with her. Eloise's daughter, Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman), is an FBI agent, and she arrests Adam for his mother's death. Soon, the investigation reveals that it was a suicide, and then Clay is released. Verona informs Clay that the group that scammed her mother has been on the FBI's radar for some time but is difficult to track. Adam then takes his own path to find the gang and runs mad on a murder spree. His last target is Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), who tries his best to stop him, but he is unaware of what a beekeeper means and how dangerous he is. I don't think I should give away any spoilers on Beekeeper's identity and work and how he takes on the entire gang alone, so let's keep that part fresh for your viewing experience.Kurt Wimmer writes a basic revenge drama, and the screenplay adds some thrilling and brutal moments. Each time the Beekeeper is out hunting, he stings, and he stings sharply and on the right spot. Some nerve-breaking killing moments will have your eyes filled with blood, and there will be a lot of blood in front of your eyes as well. The Beekeeper has some insanely ridiculous theories about its main character and his features that look ridiculously unbelievable, but also ridiculously entertaining. I mean, let's say you want a hero who can beat anybody to pulp, can burn down any place, can breach security even at the president's party hall, and then come out of everything without a scratch. Wouldn't you freaking love him and scream for him? Kurt Wimmer has written Adam Clay, aka The Beekeeper, with all those features. The only problem with his writing is that it follows all those traditional packages you've been served for years. Predictability is not good for any film, unless it's a known/true story.Let's talk about Statham Man. He is a killer-a real one, I mean. Hobbs and Shaw showed his calibre and why he deserves to be one of the leading action stars in the F&F franchise, but sadly, the makers are too busy with others even after 10 movies. This man deserves a solo action movie like The Beekeeper to prove his talent. He scares hell out of everyone in movie, be it antagonists, cops, or even the bigger players in this game. Emmy Raver-Lampman gets a few good scenes, but even those aren't healthy ones. Josh Hutcherson is your rich, spoiled brat and, as expected, a greedy man and a drug addict. What more can you expect from him? Jeremy Irons plays the interesting character of Wallace, which I think had more scope but is cut short because he didn't really enter the game of blood. Phylicia Rashad and Jemma Redgrave's support is really helpful.The Beekeeper is a wacky action flick with superb action choreography. Geoffrey O'Brien's editing keeps it short and quick, with a gripping runtime of 100 minutes excluding credits. You'll see some decent framework by Gabriel Beristain that could have done better, especially the creative part of long action set pieces. The film has a few loopholes that should have been covered with some emotional quotient, but what's done is done now. The sound design and production design have been okay. It's good to see the man who made the first installment of the Fast & Furious franchise come up with such a violent flick that isn't about logic but is hardly illogical as far as a crowd-pleasing experience is concerned. Nevertheless, he delivers a worthy action drama for the devotees of the genre and devotees of Jason Statham. That retrograded ambition from 2001 could have been avoided, or, better yet, this film could have been made much earlier to have a better impact. But it's not that corny anyway. So, order your popcorn and sit for this 100-minute action-packed ride, and try and ask your theatre manager to skip the intermission break.RATING - 6/10*","6/10"
"samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024","The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat.","1/10"
"sanctummorium","1 July 2023","That opening action scene was everything the rest of the movie should have been.As for the rest...all I can ask is why. There was some strong potential and some actual good moments, but is complete with some stupid, cringe Marvel-style joke.Why kill off Indy's own son just to replace him with an insufferable goddaughter?Why ruin the ending of Crystal Skull by making Indy and Marion split up? (they get back together at the end, but that doesn't fix it).Why is Teddy, the most unimportant and pointless character, even in the movie?Why does Helena INTENTIONALLY try to leave Indy for dead every chance she gets?This movie has no real reason to exist. No motive to getting the dial, the premise of time travel becomes less impactful when we go to some 'random' historical battle rather than 1939.Although I gotta say, the way it was portrayed felt like a more believable premise than aliens.","7/10"

Will Indy be able to save the world once again !!The fifth film of the Indiana Jones franchise and the final one. Unfortunately this film should have been a fitting farewell to the legend.. but alas it isn't !!This is the only film that hasn't been directed by Steven Spielberg and conceived by George Lucas and it shows !!To cut some slack to the makers , it isn't a total dud . But the adrenaline rush moments that made us a fan of the franchise in the first place are sorely missed. The plot is insipid and the climax could have been more tense and gripping!!However the first 25 mins with a younger de-aged Indy ( with AI and other special effects) in an action scene set in 1944 is probably the best part of the film !!For die-hard fans of the the Indiana Jones franchise, a decent one time watch and a time to say goodbye to Harrison Ford who has been essaying this role since the 80's!!Going with 2.5 stars out 5 with a 0.5 star for Harrison Ford who gives it his all ....

"saraccan","11 May 2018","If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.","6/10"
"SaranshTMF","16 July 2017","This is a humiliation for a series we all loved and adored. Ceasor's character is completely downsized. There is NO WAR in the film. The ending is bogus and outright stupid. There are hardly any dialogues. The entire film is like a slideshow where characters take a lifetime to complete an action. By the end of first half, I could hear bunch of people snoring and the rest complaining why they bothered watching the film. This film deserves a Razzi. The only silver-lining is the first 10 minutes. How can you fail so miserably despite have such an amazing production value?","9/10"
"sashank_kini-1","27 November 2012","My first recommendation to any adult would be to watch this film alone- not with their noisy friends, or meddlesome children. The reason for this is simple - in order to totally submit oneself to the visual and spiritual experience delivered by the movie, one has to remain alone, just as Pi does for over two hundred days, being the only human stranded on the lifeboat. I believe this experience cannot be savored when one's emotional response is dictated by the collective feeling of the group (just imagine sitting there holding back your tears because you do not want your friends to snicker at you. In spite of going alone, I was disturbed a couple of times by some people who were wowed by the lion ( it's a tiger, for god's sake!), so I'm glad I didn't bring anyone with me who would have surely robbed me of the delight and wonderment that Life of Pi delivers. The story of Pi's journey of a lifetime begins with a enchantingly dreamy opening sequence showing animals, birds and reptiles of many kinds at a zoo. What's so astonishing about this sequence is that you are so lost admiring the beauty of the animals shown without narration but with a soulful Indian classical music score that you pay no attention to the opening credits until the name of Ang Lee pops up more prominently at the end. The first Pi that we see is probably in his forties and has already completed his journey long back. On his uncle's insistence, he shares his life story with a writer. As the older Pi narrates his story, the camera inter-cuts between the present time and Pi's childhood through fluid dissolves and morphs. We get to know why Pi is called Pi - a queer name for an Indian kid; we can make out that Pi is one curious boy who believes in exploring religion and spirituality and has a deep affinity to animals. A pivotal incident in his early days involving Richard Parker changes his attitude towards life and other matters that were consequential to him before. His family decides to move to Canada on a Japanese ship along with the zoo animals; an unexpected storm hits them on their journey and only Pi manages to hold on to the life boat... along with an injured zebra, a friendly orangutan, a cantankerous hyena and the mighty Richard Parker. What follows then is a deeply mesmerizing tale of courage, will to survive, perseverance, realization and ultimately - hope, which is what the world needs right now, hope.Life of Pi is full of deep and important themes, and I can say, based on the experience I had in the theater, that more than three fourth of the audience were either i) oblivious to the metaphorical allusions or ii) not interested enough to get them. If you give adequate attention to the movie, you shall realize how important the element of water is the film; the swimming pool scene with Pi's uncle, Piscine being named after the pool and the entire journey taking place in the ocean - all three incidents have the element of water in common. Why does Pi look closely at the ocean water and see his life flash before him? Is it a commentary of how fate works? What about the journey of Richard Parker and Pi? Is it only to show the relation between man and animal? Pi fears Parker and distances himself from his fear, only to confront and later conquer his fear (i.e. Parker) but not by destroying Parker but by developing an understanding with him (his fear). What does Pi gain from this journey? Hope is the word I get whenever I search for answers, and isn't hope required in this world, especially when you lose everything? And hasn't this message been reiterated so many times after 7/11 and the financial crisis in USA? Obama's inaugural address when he was elected for the first time stressed on hope, films such as 127 hours channelize hope. It isn't a surprise that Life of Pi has come this year and is doing well at the box office - people want films that carry the message of hope. And, I think Life of Pi teaches that you can get hope provided you have the will to survive and resist the temptation of an enclosed existence. There are some standout scenes in Life of Pi which includes the opening scene, the storm scene, the moment Pi looks into the water wondering what Richard is looking intently at and the second storm scene. The third scene from above is especially noteworthy because of the way Ang Lee has filmed it - after the camera takes us underwater to get a view of Pi's vision, it goes back to show Pi's reaction for a second, and then, for about two seconds,cuts to the face of Richard Parker looking at him.This was one unforgettable moment that shook me completely. I've mentioned the second storm scene as a notable one as it gives us some minutes to reflect on whatever has happened in the film, and this is the point people should think instead of answering their cell phone calls ( person next to me).Irfan Khan so honestly conveyed his sadness towards the end with not more than a teardrop. I really wished Suraj Sharma could do that instead of feigning grief by simply quivering his lips mechanically, speaking without conveying a sense of terrible isolation and not understanding fully the relevance of his character in the film. In many scenes, his eyes do not give us anything and he says important lines without hinting the subtext beneath them. It's still a good job considering he has no prior acting experience.","8/10"

"saull28","9 October 2017","Is rare to see these days of special effects a movie well done, acted and with an interesting dramatic story, most sci-fi movies are 80% special effects, 5% whatever acting and 5% simple boring story, like Transformers and the like, GI-Joe and the like, but this trilogy had a consistent realism and story very close to the original '60s and '70s intention with only the necessary SFX, and this movie even had some good humor, it wasn't a senseless warmongering bunch of apes against another group but of humans, it was a realistic post-apocalyptic scenario with realistic circumstances and decisions; wasn't thought provoking because that wasn't the intention, the message was to tell the story of what happened in this alternative Universe where things resulted this way, everything was logical, interesting a few surprises and well delivered, not predictable most of it, that's why I don't understand the dislike, maybe they wanted to see a massive scale war with interesting battles and strategy well that isn't consistent with the previous 2 movies, or the trilogy story, so if you're stupid enough to not see this, that's your problem, go find simple and full of violence movie elsewhere you stupid ape","10/10"

"sbentley-90703","26 June 2023","Saw the 9.0 here and was super excited to see this film. Very disappointing! Plot moves at light speed, and continues to jump around the whole film. Scenes flash every 2 seconds and it was exhausting to follow. Animation is excellent, but this movie lacked the hook that made the first one so good. Maybe this is where movies are now headed, but I hope not. For a show aimed toward a younger audience, the film was way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes and seemed to hold the audience hostage. Very hard to keep track of all the characters and plot shifts. Was hoping for something better but it seemed like a comic book on speed.","8/10"
"sbweightman","12 January 2024","A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt.","8/10"
"Scarefish","10 September 2023","Well, they've finally managed it.The first Ant-Man nearly had good character moments, it crippled itself with the ever-so-apparent ""funny problem"" that has been plaguing Marvel's films for many years now. The sequel had much better spectacle - it was genuinely stunning at times; it's nearly enough to let me ignore the heavy Flanderization of all of our established characters. Now we have the third movie, and somehow we've ended up with the worst of both worlds.The characters have lost all sense of individuality and urgency that they had in the first film, or what little of it they had back then. The ensemble plays off as that of a mid-day American sitcom, and not one of the ones that anybody really emjoys sitting down and watching actively. Full scenes dedicated to Scott's asides are not even the least bit funny as every joke is incredibly obvious and surface-level, oddly sandwiching the film with an incredibly cringe-worthy opening and ending that feel entirely useless. I don't think I have been so disengaged with any piece of media since I saw The Emoji Movie, though there are some sequences where this film at least creeps up to just being plain bad rather than abusively lazy. Scott has pics taken with peoples' dogs, he gets mistaken for Spider-Man, and he has a Hollywood-style panic attack that ends in an anti-climax that thinks it's much funnier than it is. These are the most memorable bits of the story due to their placement at the most crucial sections of the film, and that plays a huge role in sinking this movie's rating for me. It's like they wanted to numb viewers going into the film's first act, and then Sucker Punch them right at the end. This film is creative anaesthesia.Somehow, with so much special effects and so much money dumped into it, this film manages to be the ugliest film in all of the MCU. I'm sure the special effects actually made the film worse. They spent countless resources ruining their sub-par film to turn it into one of the worst films I've seen in years. M. O. D. O. K. Is shocking; there was a time when Marvel was churning out visually stunning films back-to-back. Even if the other elements of the films were lacking, you could at least rely on popcorn entertainment, but not here. For the first time in the MCU I'm replused by the special effects more often than not - this was trending with some underbaked effects in Black Panther and Black Widow, but I didn't expect it to get to this point so quickly. This feels more like a low-budget TV film managing to seem bigger than it should be through clever effects, but it's a huge big-budget Hollywood film that's crippled by sloppy effects and messy environments through the vast majority of the film. I can only imagine this is due to a lack of cohesive, or decent, artistic direction; the incredibly poor money management on display here is insulting. I've never seen a better example of how bloated film budgets are on the verge of destroying the film industry as a whole, and by this point I'm almost hoping for it to happen already. After the pandemic we just got out of, the last thing we need are thousands of unincredible films that think they're worth our time. At a certain point I just have to say enough is enough and file for a divorce from corporate films.Quantumania turns the infinitesimal quantum realm into a busy mess nearly as sloppy as its slapdash script.I guess the team behind Quantumania just didn't quite understand what ""less is more"" really means.","6/10"

Tired old stakes and storylines we have seen again, and again.Marvel appears doomed as it heads into phase 5, as we see the decline and probably the ending of superhero movies over the next 5 to 10 years.Paul Rudd has never exactly been a superhero type - and never exactly instilled anything but a bland ""Im here"" presence on the screen.

"scootm16","18 February 2023","Where do I even start with this boring, exposition-drenched Star Wars wannabe?I guess I'll start at when I knew the movie was going to be trash. At the beginning of the movie, Ant-Man has to go down to the local police station to pick up his daughter from jail. She was arrested because the police were tasked with clearing out a homeless encampment (in reality, encampments are a serious crime issue on the West coast), but Ant-Man's daughter didn't like that, so she destroyed police equipment. The next scene at dinner, Hank Pym said he would've marched in there and broken her out of jail. Why is Marvel pushing anti-policing/anti-justice and having a teenage girl as their ""martyr"" or spokesperson or whatever. Shouldn't the Marvel heroes be working together with the police to stop crime? What is this leftist gibberish? I have grown to expect this from Marvel after the Disney acquisition, but man were the politics extra loud in this movie.Regardless of the extreme leftist political pandering written by someone who is completely detached from actual society and the real world being forced onto us, the movie was still trash. Kang was an absolute joke of a villain in this movie. I have no idea how they plan(ned) on making him the new big bad, someone on Thanos's level after what I just saw. The action was so boring and drab because you know everyone's going to be fine. There's no sense of danger or risk that something won't go as planned. So many scenes and sets were just blatantly ripped from A New Hope it's honestly pathetic.I know Disney owns Marvel and Star Wars, but keep them separate. Let them have their own feel to them, like back when the first Avengers came out. That movie had its own unique feel/aura and has aged extremely well. Marvel movies are now too busy pandering to politics to tell an interesting story with real fleshed out characters dealing with serious issues that have consequences. It feels like every Marvel movie is trying to be Thor Ragnarok now, and that only spells disaster.I'm more sad than mad. I thought this movie looked decent from the trailers too. After this, I don't think the days of actual quality films like Iron Man or Avengers are coming back, not from Disney.The most criminal thing about this movie is they somehow even made Paul Rudd unlikable.2/10.","7/10"
"scott-sw","21 August 2019","The hardest thing to do is end something. The ending of a story, novel, or movie is probably the hardest thing to write. This is not the climax and falling action, but the resolution, where all the dangling threads are tied up and resolved. Very few writers can create one with supreme satisfaction - mostly because in this day and age writers want sequels and franchises. Avengers Endgame is the pinnacle of Marvel movies. It is a masterpiece of the super-hero genre. It gives closure, and resolution.
The movie picks up almost immediately after Thanos snapped half the world out of existence. The remaining Avengers, Iron Man (Tony Stark), War Machine (Don Cheedle), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are trying to gather their wits after they had their asses handed to them.
Tony is on his way back to Earth from Titan. His only companion is Nebula (Karen Gillian). Fortunately, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) comes to the rescue. Bringing them back to Earth, they are reunited ... for a moment. Tony wants nothing to do with them after Cap's betrayal. He goes back to Pepper.
The remaining heroes track down Thanos (Josh Brolin) and find the Infinity Stones have destroyed themselves, as well as him. Now, what do we do?
Five years later, a van in San Francisco has its computer activated by a mouse. It activates the shrinking device that left Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) stranded in the shrunken universe. He comes back - but the five year isolation was only five hours to the Ant Man. He traverses the nation to find the Avengers. When he learns of what happened, he has an idea. The microscopic universe has entry and exit points in time.
Yes, they can travel back in time and find the Infinity Stones, bring them back, and snap everyone back into existence. Hey, you have to realize that time travel was going to come into this sooner or later. The Avengers need Tony to figure out a way to take out the random effects, but he is tied too much to Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow), and their daughter, Morgan.
Tony, though, cannot back out of a possibility of setting things right. He is onboard with the idea, so three teams travel back to different points. Tony, Bruce, Steve, and Scott (hey, my name's Steve Scott!) head to New York after the Avengers battle. Roadie, Nebula, Nadia, and Clint (Jeremy Renner) return to the stellar world where two other stones exist. Rocket and Thor return to Asgaarrd before its destruction to fetch a couple of others.
As they find the stones, they find themselves - as well as a slew of MCU characters that helped and hindered them on the way. Loki, Brumlow, Sitwell, Pierce (Robert Redford) all have their cameos as former HYDRA secret operatives. Of course, it would be a sin not to have Tom Hiddleston return as Loki. Tony and Steve go to another spot where Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy Carter (Haylee Atwell), and Tony gets to have some words with his father, Howard Stark (John Slattery).
Thor gets to see Jane again (Natalie Portman), as well as his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo). Rocket has to work hard and convince him to take the stones back. Of course, Thor cannot leave without one particular thing.
Meanwhile, Clint and Nadia have to retrieve the Soul Stone. They need a soul to get it. At the same time, Thanos, who is alive at this point, realizes the Nebula of the past is having glitches. He and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are able to figure out what they are doing there. Realizing their plan, he has to stop them and make sure his plan comes through.
You can tell this all-star cast was handled well, providing story, action, laughs, and even tears. A few of these heroes sacrifice themselves for others. They get to reconcile themselves over past mistakes, regrets, and get to redeem themselves. They are reunited with loves ones lost five years ago when Thanos snapped his fingers. And they fight together against a foe for the first time since Avengers Age of Ultron. They were one team.
Someone could easily nit-pick this one, especially on the time travel. However, the ending brings so much satisfaction. Between the sacrifices, the second chances, the characters all have their resolutions tied up, with no post-credit scenes. Some of the character arcs are messy, but the movie provides an emotional satisfaction unheralded in motion picture history. Avengers Endgame gets a perfect score.","10/10"

"scottrob36","13 July 2017","I went into this film with high expectations after seeing positive reviews but I was highly disappointed. The movie was filled with plot holes and a poor concept. The previous two were brilliant with story lines where you were drawn into the dilemmas between ape and man but the third one there was none of that. There were a few characters that didn't fit and I was perplexed why the young girl was added, I can only imagine to give the apes and one human some positive interaction. The main villain didn't get a lot of screen time and I do wonder if Woody Harrelson was miscast for the role. If like me when you finish watching the movie you will be asking the same questions like ""why did they do that...what was the reason for that...how did they manage that?"" then it is obvious the movie didn't give the audience a better thought out script without gaping plot holes.","6/10"
"scotyrocks","17 June 2023","Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a serviceable but ultimately forgettable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film has some fun action sequences and visual effects, but the story is weak and the characters are underdeveloped.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are both charming as Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, respectively, but they don't have much to work with here. The supporting cast is also mostly wasted, with Jonathan Majors being the only one who make much of an impression.The film's villain, Kang the Conqueror, is also a disappointment. He's a powerful and menacing figure in the comics, but he's reduced to a generic bad guy here. The film's story also doesn't do much to explore his motivations or backstory.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a disappointing film. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's a forgettable entry in the MCU that fans of the franchise will probably enjoy, but it's unlikely to win over anyone who's not already a fan.","7/10"
"Screen_O_Genic","29 January 2022","The finale of the lengthy series featuring a constellation of Marvel's luminaries, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a watchable superhero flick that merges real life interactions and explosive fantasy. Featuring A-List stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk and Black Widow respectively the film finds our heroes in the eternal tale of the battle between good and evil and some stones. Decent acting with simple but adequate special effects help carry the view. The biggest snag of the whole enterprise is its length. Clocking in at three hours the span strains an already shaky script and the mature viewer's patience. Perhaps I've long outgrown Fantasy movies and seeing full grown men and women in skimpy outfits playing cartoon characters challenged belief and the overall silliness of it can't be shaken off. Maybe it's not just me; the bored, going through the motions look of the actors especially at the start of the film seems to mirror this. The thought of having to wear those tight stretchy outfits for the umpteenth time and having to memorize and utter those prepubescent lines were too much despite the hefty paycheck. A massive hit despite all of that, I still remember the loooooong lines in the cinemas to watch this and I guess the masses are basically dorks who'll embrace fantasies on the big screen to forget themselves and their lives. This is one to burn time with the kiddos and make you appreciate your soda and popcorn more.","10/10"
"sddavis63","2 July 2013","Having read and enjoyed the book, I approached this movie very cautiously, wondering how ti could possibly live up to the novel on which it's based. In truth, it didn't. Rarely does a movie based on a novel manage to do that. However, while it doesn't meet the standard of the novel, I have to give credit to Ang Lee and others who were involved in the production. ""Life of Pi"" (the novel) would have been a very difficult novel to adapt for the screen for a whole variety of reasons - but I think Lee and others did a commendable job of bringing the basic story to life.The film starts out relatively slowly, with an exploration of Pi's upbringing. Named ""Piscine Molitor Patel"" after a swimming pool in France, Piscine adopts the shortened form of ""Pi."" He's raised in India, spends much of his time observing the animals at the zoo owned by his family and embarks on a spiritual quest, raised as a Hindu, but also adopting Islam and Christianity, because he simply wants to love God. Then, his father decides to move to Canada, and while on the way the ship they're travelling on sinks and Pi finds himself the only human survivor, adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger named Richard Parker for companionship.The shipwreck and the voyage in the lifeboat is wonderfully portrayed, if a little bit (to say the least) unrealistic. Of course, when I say that I'm falling into the trap of the Japanese ship owners, who also can't accept that Pi's story can be real. This, of course, is the spiritual crux of the story: what, exactly, is reality? Are some stories too good to be true? Are some stories so good that they can only have come from God? It's an interesting spiritual exploration - not at all heavy handed, but often front and centre.The ocean voyage is basically a one man show, carried effectively by Suraj Sharma as Pi. The other characters, of course, are the animals in the lifeboat: Richard Parker the tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. The animals are animated, but incredibly realistic. The older Pi, who tells the story, is played by Irffan Khan, whose soft-spoken portrayal captures the essence of the character.It's a commendable adaptation of the novel. The opening scenes in India left me a bit dry to be honest, but the very powerful portrayal of the ocean voyage drew me back in completely. Overall, a pretty decent adaptation of the novel.

This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid £12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying.

"seaview1","11 March 2013","Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible. He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe. It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father. The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship. During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker. An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast. As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies. When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience. He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character. Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion. His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story. He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, ""Do animals have souls?"" In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul. Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.There are unanswered questions. What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth? Is there a more plausible explanation? Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear. Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life. And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful.","8/10"

Where the first movie felt like a conclusive origin story about Miles Morales, this instead feels like an expansion of the universe and the beginning of a larger tale.In the end it feels very much like the first part of two, and I can't wait for the second half.

K who was a ""killing machine"" and didn't proceed to kill anyone of significance at all.Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania had incredible potential to kick off Phase 5 with a bang, but in the end, everything that happened didn't have any significance for the future other then some funny looking kangs seen in the End-Credits scene that the audience has no connection with.The future of Marvel looks dark and i am not excited anymore.","5/10"

"sepetcenk","23 April 2023","This movie demonstrates that no matter how much money you pour into a bad idea and attempt to build something around it, it is ultimately futile. We are all drawn towards the gravitational pull of the postmodern approach in every art form, and while it's understandable to want to appear postmodern, the filmmakers seem to have struggled with grasping the concept of postmodern narration. It's disheartening to witness the amateur directing mistakes, and even the actors appear to be confused. It's truly incredible how this film came to be. It's as if Marvel was purchased by a third-world company and produced a movie solely to impress themselves. While the storyline may make sense to younger viewers, it falls short for true Marvel fans.","6/10"
"sergew","18 May 2018","I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where is the beef?"", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.","1/10"
"SerpentMage","12 November 2018","I have no idea how this movie managed to get an 8.6. The story writing is exceptionally bad, and cliches used are dimes a dozen. It seemed a very rushed story involving too many actors and super heros. I do like super hero movies and do enjoy a good fantasy, but this was not it.","3/10"
"serrisex","2 January 2019","The film itself is absolutely awesome. It mixes emotional content and brutal fighting really well. All the movie can be split on two parts: introduction in Broly's and other saiyans story, then fighting-fighting-fighting. That's strange, the main reason for this, I believe, is origins of Bardock's family story in the film which was borrowed from a tiny manga, totally uncanonical.
And here's the problem of this fabulous movie: from DBZ we know quite well that saiyans are the warrior race and their occupation is killing. Goku's mother was quite tough woman and we saw it with our own eyes. But now DBS: Broly tells us many, many of saiyans and Gine herself were... absolutely human. And it's very, very bad. Movie is canon now, but it collides with previous canon.So, the positive and negative sides of movie:
+ Broly, the monster who kills for revenge from previous movies now has a much better story and character you'll love
+ fresh art style, top quality animation
+ fight scenes are something else, you need to see itToriyama knows how to make you feel, but he makes entirely different person from Gine in the processNo matter what, movie is must see for any Dragon Ball fan and all the good anime lovers, too.","8/10"
"sevastokrator","16 July 2017","To me, the banality of the film is insulting. I don't know with which sequel to compare it first, with Highlander II or The Matrix Revolutions.Although both Rise and Dawn had their flaws, I wasn't going to nitpick because I loved the films so much that I kept turning on the suspension of disbelief whenever necessary. So I really didn't expect that War could in any way disappoint me if they only kept the pace. But I was wrong. The story was poor, plot unconvincing, characters not developed enough and with idiotic motives and behavior, ""dramatic"" scenes lacking any maturity whatsoever.Despite the fact that the film is not about any kind of war, and that the trailer is misleading and a total lie. Yes, there is no war in the film, and especially no war between apes and humans - the only thing that resembled war had already happened in the Dawn. The film is a mixture of Schindler's List and Prison Break, while failing both. So, expect Scofield brothers with a Jar Jar Binks alike side-kick, trying to escape a Nazi death camp, and you'll get the picture. Pure luck is the main factor of literally everything significantly important happening. All characters, including Caesar, are reduced to total idiots surfing on the waves of ludicrous decisions followed by lucky circumstances.It's a shame to rate a film with such magnificent score, scenery, shots, and CGI with a 3/10, but it is just beyond my comprehension that they couldn't employ a decent writer. Those were the shallowest 2 hours I spent in the cinema lately, and I especially feel cheated on because, to me, they ruined something that could have been a great Sci-Fi trilogy of the 2010's.I will not go on about the nods to 1968 original, nor the forcibly put sub-plots to explain how some events in the original film were possible (a virus that causes loss of speech in one day, I mean, come on!) Or Koba's followers who are now willing to become humiliated human slaves and ape-killers, because oh they hate Caesar so much. Come on, the point of joining Koba in the first place was irrational and uncompromising hatred towards humans! I could go on, almost every single motive for doing anything in the film is ridiculous.Perhaps I am being biased, I admit I am watching in disbelief all these enthusiastic and positive reviews. But I cannot find a single positive thing about the film. To me, it defiled the trilogy and made me sorry for seeing Rise back in 2011 to begin with, and getting hooked up to the story.And perhaps it is not that awful in the end, but missing the opportunity to finish a great piece of work with a decent final touch is worse than making a poor one from the start.","1/10"
"sfarrow8","2 June 2023","I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.","10/10"
"sgaddala","9 June 2023","""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is an absolute disaster of a film, a complete waste of time and money. It is a mind-numbingly boring and convoluted mess, with a plot that makes no sense and characters that are devoid of any depth or purpose. The humor falls flat, the action sequences are uninspired, and the visual effects are underwhelming. It's a painful reminder that not every superhero film can be a hit, and this one is a definite miss. Save yourself the agony and skip this cinematic catastrophe.Save yourself the agony and skip this cinematic catastrophe. Marvel's Quantumania is a soulless cash grab, tarnishing the franchise's reputation with its lackluster storytelling and forgettable performances.

Like I said, Jason can read me the phone book so this is for a fan or a lover but not someone looking for quality film making. I enjoyed it for entertainment but quality was lacking.

"shadden66","2 May 2019","I cant say I was disappointed in Endgame as a whole, they wrapped up this phase in the franchise pretty well.Parts did drag on longer than needed, other parts rushed that could have used more time. But that's ok I can deal with that.Endgame was not as good as Infinity War in my opinion, IW had much better pacing and dialogue than EG and the story was much better.Stuff I liked:Tony Stark/Steve Rodgers dialogue. Any time those two are on screen together it just flat out works. They could talk about dinner reservations and I'd be engrossed in that conversation..Lewboski reference. Loved it..Hawkeye/Black Widow going after the Soul Stone. You knew one of them was going to have to die to get it but intense and a surprise all the way through. Well done.Soundtrack. Dear Mr. Fantasy a fav of mine and to hear that open made my night.How they brought back Gamora. Nice twist didn't see that coming. And the ""real"" Nebula working on her to win her over.Starks death, Rodger's ending. Both perfect and worked. Glad he got his dance and a real lifeFew things I didn't care for.Wanted more Rocket interaction with the other Avengers. Expected more Rocket/Tony Stark back and forth in witty dialogue. Would have been epic.Captain Marvel. Over powered and didn't earn it. Hoped for better than he solo movie and it never happened.Time Travel. I figured the quantum realm would come into play to reverse things, but Stark figuring out time travel in general was a little much. I think with some creative writing they could have skipped all that time travel discovery stuff and just used the quantum realm angle to fix things and bring people back.Not enough Thanos. Even with Thanos coming back into play, not enough screen time. He's way to great a character and needed much more attention. In EG he didn't have as great the dialogue as IW gave him and even less depth than in IW. Jim Starlin's creation deserved better.The whole Battle of the Five Armies Hobbit ending... Would have been more intense with just Thanos and his Black Order - they could have held their own against all the Avengers new and oldAs a whole though I got to admit I walked away satisfied. We always want more and/or expect different or better, but this is what we got.I can live with it and be happy. Thank you Marvel Studios","10/10"
"Shadowboy_25cm","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out,
it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.Highly recommended.","8/10"
"shaikhirshad-41223","19 January 2024","A complete John Wick vibe in the start of 15 mins I'm getting from this film but director couldn't get to the depth of the character and makes an easy predictable watch.Director David really had a nice idea of this script that he executes perfectly with tons of good action sequences and fast paced screenplay.But only fault of this film is that there is no character depth on the story and one cannot connect with the character emotionally.Though director made a nice setup in the storyline to catching the scamsters from start to end is a good take and can build up your interest but at the end story can be easily predicted.The film completely relies on Jason Statham action sequences and fast paced screenplay which will hook you up till the end.Cinematography is good specially music sounds in fight scenes is cool to watch.Jason Statham shines in acting performances but rest of the cast don't and seem very average.All n all A good action flick which is definitely a one time watch for the weekend but don't expect much....","6/10"

I canr wait to see where the series will go next.","7/10"
"Shakor77","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers? I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","1/10"
"Shakor77","30 June 2023","I didn't expect much from this movie as I know that it would be another disaster made by Kathleen Kennedy's Lucas Film and sadly I was right.I grew up watching Indiana Jones and although I never took it that seriously it was a fun adventure/action flick with a potent Harrison Ford. This is anything but.Indy, beside the a short prologue where they used CGI to de-age him, is a sad old man who down for the count and although you think this movie is about revitalizing him to his old self but it is not. It is yet another Kathleen Kennedy trademarked plot of replacing a white hero by a (white) women who is so dislikeable that it is hard to feel anything good about her.The plot is convoluted and in disarray which makes me think it went back and forth in the cutting room and I could not care less where it went and just wanted to leave the cinema. RIP Indiana Jones, you deserved better.","2/10"

"shanayneigh","27 August 2023","Remember when people were able to tell a story in two hours or less? When stories had a beginning, middle and an end? When the number one priority wasn't to build a never ending franchise, but to simply tell a story?I liked Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) which I thought was surprisingly good.Please, give the whole multiverse schtick a rest. Sure, it offers the great (merchandising) opportunity to include a zillion versions of Spiderman, but it also reduces the stakes to absolutely nothing.In the first half of the movie they establish the new main bad guy (or so one would think) whose backstory is a ridiculous throwaway gag by one of the animators of the first movie. After an hour or so the new bad guy vanishes from the movie. As we get closer to the end I look at my watch thinking ""There's no way they'll wrap this up in the ten minutes that are left"". And of course they don't, since their priority isn't to tell a coherent story, but to build a franchise. So we're left hanging with no resolution. If we want one, we'll have to pay for the next movie too! Genius film making.Of course it was 20-30 minutes too long as per usual for comic book movies today. And this is only the first installment! Including the sequel (or rather, the third act of this movie) this simple story will probably be about an hour longer than Gone With The Wind. Amazing.I watched this movie on a huge screen in Tokyo. The visuals were grating. The dotted areas and the double/triple outlines, which I suppose are meant to emulate early printing techniques of shadows/gradients and out-of-focus areas did not look good on the big screen. The first movie employed the same visual style, although not as pronounced as in this sequel. On a small screen (like my 65 inch OLED at home) they were not an issue. But on a huge cinema screen they were making my eyes bleed.There is no way I'll pay to see the third one.","9/10"

Everything happening all at once with great intensity states. Action feels appealing with a solid purpose. Acting is best by Paul Rudd and the villain, others were ok with the acting. Comedy is fairly kicked in certain times feels good. The runtime is actually fine but plot makes it feel slow.Suggesting better pace would boost this film.","6/10"
"Shaunmatthewc","17 January 2024","I really enjoyed this, I can't lie. Coming as an 80s action fan and following Statham's career since the early days of Snatch and the first Transporter film. His character in this befriends an old lady who falls for a phishing scam and kills herself.Then it's up to him to take revenge on everyone responsible with some of the most over the top ""Punisher like"" kills ever seen. There's something righteous about seeing these horrible people get their comeuppance which doesn't happen as much in real life unfortunately. Everyone in this acts well, the over the top Kiwi henchmen who pops up was hilarious.Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a good job as a couple of slimy villains. Emmy Raver-Lampman from Umbrella Academy is decent enough as an FBI agent trying to stop The Beekeeper. If you like old school action and don't need to be pummeled over the head with virtue signalling or any other messaging I would definitely recommend this. It's nice to see Statham bounce back with Meg 2 and this film after the abysmal Expendables 4.","10/10"
"Shaunmatthewc","23 May 2023","Wow, where to begin. Basically so many Marvel films after Endgame have been completely forgettable. Ant-Man 3 is no different. I expected the Quantum Realm to be more wacky and out there just like I expected Doctor Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness to have well more Multiverse. The story seemed very bland to me, it was entertaining but nothing new, we've seen it all a million times before. It doesn't help that some of the story seemed like a carbon copy of Tron Legacy. Scott Lang was missing his heist team here and it shows, the film falls flat without them appearing. Kang is supposed to be bigger and harder than Thanos but was almost a complete throwaway. Watch if you've got nothing better to do but I wouldn't go out my way to see it. Marvel need to do better!","2/10"
"shawnbriggs","24 January 2019","It was enjoyable as a fan as this delivered sooooo much fan service, but the script lacked a certain quality of execution and the editing & animation was a bit too pacey at times - probably to cover up a lack of quality control in some of the artwork.","9/10"
"shawneofthedead","24 April 2019","THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films, it has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the franchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with heart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. That's no small feat, and it's even more remarkable that a movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesn't fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy script or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCU's crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers, their stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxy's population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing witness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with the crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into darkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...THE GREAT: Endgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a decade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save their families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the film's comic relief, but both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to juggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels virtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the staggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved characters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in stitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers' genius and their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is emphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you understand what the heck is going on if you haven't watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few logical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from the wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt tribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it includes Stan Lee's final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce the interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie that started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around the character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of Marvel Comics' more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencer's run on Captain America: Steve Rogers.)CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCU's core strengths, with Oscar winners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting strategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but manage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all. Hemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm and intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and Renner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces. Evans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a man who's - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films belongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully conveys every shade and layer of his character's hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have never needed that Tony Stark has a heart.RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine emotion. It's the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and it's worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008.","7/10"
"shawneofthedead","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","9/10"

"shenzencowboy","2 July 2023","I completely disagree with the lukewarm reviews for this film and thought it was a terrific romp and a great return to form. I don't know what you have to do to please some people. It keeps you engaged the entire time and takes you back to the good old days when Raiders first came out. It's a definite return to form after some very average films in the series.The technology is clever and used superbly. It's wonderful to see some of the old cast members again plus a few new stars. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is wonderful with the right mix of comedy and drama. There was a great rapport between the two lead characters.They wrapped up the series beautifully. It's fascinating that the storyline has an element of truth in that the focus of the movie actually exists and is one of the great mysteries.People can be overly critical but I went along for the ride and loved it. It made me remember how much I loved the first in the series. The entire cast did a great job. It's not Citizen Kane but it's a highly entertaining, rewarding final episode.","7/10"

I was fine with the movie and thought that it was well done, however I dragged my spouse to it, whom I knew would not be a fan, and he was left with a worse feeling than I even expected. Needless to say that he will not be seeing the next installment. Following this movie, we then saw Fast and Furious X, which was also an unadvertised two parter. Hollywood needs to do a better job of alerting folks to this so that an informed decision can be made. It seems that movies are getting longer, and are we now seeing that even 2 1/2 hours isn't adequate to tell a story?","10/10"

"shivasrinidhi","23 February 2023","As another reviewer here has pointed out, this movie failed to introduce kang in its runtime and loki did it better in its finale. Kang the conqueror , is supposed to be an iconic villain and given the fact that he is played by majors , his story must be over the top. Kang has this power to freeze time and he uses that laser energy sorta thing . This guy freaki'n shattered timelines . There is no way scott will win. I want to see conqueror in action. This guy is the next villian of phase five and I cannot wait to look forward to it. Well, this was before watching this boring movie.Ant-man , a little guy DEFEATED kang by ANTS.yes , a bunch of ""class -2 ""ants with laser guns that lived a 1000 years due to time dilation and evolved enough to start a civilisation and DEFEAT kang . The guy who butchered a million universes . Yay, kang lost to some ants.Kang's powers were inconsistent . He killed freedom fighters using lasers and when team antman arrives , kang stops using his powers and it becomes a fist fight.The real kang would have mopped the floor with ants.Kang can stop time and those ants would have frozen. Kang could have used lasers. No he doesn't use any of them and just activates a shield and BARELY Holds those ants on his own. You want me to believe that THIS guy , who lost to some ants and ONE avenger be a multiversal time - controlling omnipotent avengers-level threat? Sorry not buying that.Beside that , the first act of this movie is slow , like too slow with that classic "" I didn't tell you because I wanna protect you ""trope.The trailers made my hype for kang touch the skies . But this movie proved I was wrong. Iam a marvel fanboy but even I am tired of this. It is obvious that marvel is hyping its audience for a future that will not come. GOTG 3 and loki season 2 are my only hope.","6/10"

"shoebsaad","1 July 2023","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" delivers a thrilling escapade that will satisfy fans of the legendary archaeologist while introducing some exciting new elements. Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original trilogy, the film manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring icon.Harrison Ford once again dons the fedora with charisma and gusto, effortlessly slipping back into the role that made him a cinematic legend. Indy's witty one-liners, daring stunts, and unrivaled passion for history remind us why he remains an iconic figure in the world of adventure cinema.The film's plot centers around the mysterious Dial of Destiny, a mythical artifact with the power to reveal hidden truths from ancient civilizations. This time, Indiana Jones finds himself racing against ruthless adversaries and deciphering cryptic clues to unlock the dial's secrets before they fall into the wrong hands. The story weaves a web of intrigue, unearthing long-lost secrets and uncharted territories that will keep audiences engrossed from start to finish.While the action sequences are well-executed and maintain the classic Indiana Jones charm, some scenes may feel familiar to long-time fans. The film occasionally relies on tried-and-tested tropes from the franchise, missing an opportunity to push the boundaries of the character's adventures. However, the nostalgic factor will undoubtedly please those seeking the familiar thrill of an Indiana Jones film.In ""Dial of Destiny,"" the supporting cast shines, adding depth and diversity to the story. A standout performance comes from a skilled and talented Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose character brings a fresh perspective to the adventure and complements Indy's daring spirit.The movie's attention to historical detail is commendable, immersing audiences in various cultures and ancient civilizations. From sprawling temples to treacherous booby traps, the film beautifully captures the essence of these locations, offering a sense of authenticity to the breathtaking visuals.""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is an enjoyable film that will appease die-hard fans of the franchise looking for a taste of the iconic adventurer's escapades. However, it lacks the ingenuity and emotional depth that made the original trilogy stand out. While it's not a groundbreaking addition to the series, it still offers some entertaining moments and pays homage to the timeless hero that is Indiana Jones. If you're a fan of the character, you'll likely find enough to enjoy, but don't expect this adventure to leave a lasting impression.","9/10"
"shoebsaad","24 April 2023","It was a decent comic book ""Save the Universe"" movie. It had decent visual FX (I expected more for a film with a 200M budget) and has the humor you'd expect with Paul Rudd. Besides that, the movie is the weirdest and maybe the most unsatisfying MCU movie until now. It reminded me of Thor: Love and Thunder but with ants and a different story. The Story was all over the place. The whole movie is written like a Rick and Morty episode. Jeff Loveness is a talented sci-fi comedy writer, but his script struggles to make the characters distinct or take anything seriously.""Quantumania"" works on one fundamental level, setting up Kang the Conqueror as a formidable and ruthless villain for the upcoming Avengers movie, ""Avengers: Kang Dynasty,"" The movie's highlight is Jonathan Majors's role as Kang the Conqueror. His Kang was fantastic and pretty close to the comics, at least in terms of appearance.Overall I feel like this movie was just a very long TV episode. With that said, after the next Marvel films come out, I think I will go back and realize how important and good this film really was 😂.6.5/10.","7/10"
"shoebsaad","5 July 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings back onto the big screen with a stunning sequel that pushes the boundaries of animation and delivers a thrilling and heartfelt story.

"shrikrishnasriram","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only builds upon the brilliance of its predecessor but takes the scope of it to a whole new level. The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.One of the standout aspects of this film is its ability to strike a delicate balance between paying homage to the original while expanding its universe in unexpected ways. The first movie introduced us to the groundbreaking animation style, capturing our hearts with its heartfelt storytelling and dynamic characters. Across the Spider-Verse, however, elevates the stakes and explores uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in this genre of movies as a whole.The animation remains a work of art, with each frame bursting with energy, inventiveness, and meticulous attention to detail. From the kaleidoscopic visuals that bring the various universes to life, to the fluid and dynamic action sequences that leave us breathless, every moment is a testament to the creativity and talent of the filmmakers.Moreover, Across the Spider-Verse delves deeper into the characters we fell in love with in the first film, allowing them to evolve and face new challenges. The emotional depth and growth of the characters resonate with audiences on a profound level, making us cheer for their triumphs and empathize with their struggles. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartwarming moments, thrilling action, and thought-provoking themes, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. However, audiences should go into this knowing that it's definitely a 'Part 1' of a larger narrative in every sense.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cements its place not only as a worthy successor to its predecessor but as a groundbreaking and unforgettable film in its own right. It expands the Spider-Verse in ways we couldn't have imagined, immersing us in a world of boundless imagination and emotional resonance. With its breathtaking animation, complex characters, and masterful storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power and potential of animated films, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment in this extraordinary franchise.Choosing between the two is like choosing between your kids - the first is a tighter story but this movie is far more expansive and blows the scope of the movie into the stratosphere taking risks along the way. They're equally perfect in different ways.","8/10"
"shrivastavshubhanshu","22 April 2023","This movie is one of those movies which has all the hype but no substance, just like the quantum realm around us. It seemed that the writers wrote the script while being high. For example -1. Quantum size, really? They are smaller than subatomic particles. Do writers even understand what that means? I highly doubt it. To simplify, they are smaller than the particles found within an atom. So how are they breathing when they are smaller than a single atom of oxygen?2. Kang is the destroyer of multiverses, as explained in the movie. Now again, do writers really understand what the scale of that is? A destroyer of multiverses is defeated in a boxing match by Ant man and wasp at the end. Really? That's absurd and plain dumb. A grave insult to audience's intelligence. Shooting lasers is not exactly a multiverse destroying ability now is it!3. The previous movies showed good chemistry between Ant man and his daughter, who by the way has become SO annoying in this movie - an obnoxious brat would be more accurate a description. And why is she a genius? Can't any kids of superheroes be normal teenagers? She creates quantum device in her garage. I literally wanted to bang my head on the wall.4. The CGI. It is awful. Everywhere I looked there were a multitude of colors. It made me dizzy and sick.5. The first movie showed ant man using a single pym particle to bring himself back from the quantum state. They had a bunch of them in this movie, why couldn't they just do that? Lazy scriptwriting.6. MODOK. No words. It was cringe AH. From a worthy villain in comics and cartoons to this pathetic monstrosity.There are many more reasons but these are the major ones and will suffice for now. The movie seemed like it had quarter-hearted effort (not even half-hearted) by everyone who was involved. It looked like they just wanted to get over this project somehow. The end result was audience being served rubbish.","7/10"
"shubhampatelspam","16 June 2023","A complete pack of plot twists, humor, emotions, action, and amazing characters. Everything about this movie is just great. The animations, as usual, are mind-blowing and, I think, better than the first Spider Verse movie. The movie ends with the perfect cliffhanger. Even if you haven't watched any of the other Marvel movies, this one would blow your mind. However, having some knowledge about the MCU and knowing what happened in the first movie would help enhance the experience, as the other spiderman movies, starting from Tobey Maguire to Tom Holland, just gives one a perspective of the big picture and how everything connects. After Endgame, Marvel movies started going downhill and most fans, including myself, don't like it as much as the movies before. This movie, although not part of the actual MCU, has reignited my interest for Marvel movies and I am sure the next movie would be the same.","10/10"
"shweta-51657","24 April 2019","I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.Rest assured, the writers do these characters every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity Arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful. The effects, the music, the story, the emotions. Its honestly a hell of a ride.Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears.","9/10"
"ShYnBrCk","24 January 2019","This movie has everything you would want if you're a fan of any Dragon Ball shows, movies, mangas. And yet, it is a fantastic introduction, I believe, to the universe itself. I went along with a couple friends, one who had watched some DBZ but very loosely, and the other that had not seen one minute of the series. And once the credits rolled and we walked out, we were all stoked.The movie gives an exceptional background to the origins of Goku, Vegeta, Frieza, and the star of the movie, Broly. You didn't need to know anything about any of these guys before to understand the rest of the movie. As a long time DBZ fan, I learned new stuff. The only issue with a newcomer coming into this is that they wouldn't know the power-ups that Goku and Vegeta obtain (Super Saiyan God, Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan/Blue), but I don't think you need to know that. It's clear that each new iteration is a more powerful one. As to the namesake of the movie, Broly's character was extremely cool and really flushed out. A man of little words that possesses incredible power. Maybe a cliché trope, but it fit so well.The fights were some of the best Dragon Ball fights out there. It was non-stop, fast, visually pleasing, and raw. There were no lulls. I sat there tense as to what was gonna happen next in the fights. The humor was great, the dubbing was fantastic, and the animation, during the fights and in-between, were second to none.Overall, this movie was a joy to watch. It was legitimately fun. And if you're a hardcore DBZ fan, you'll love it beyond belief.","8/10"
"siderite","30 January 2024","I am going to fail this film as being as close to predictable as humanly possible, and still bad. Statham is the new Chuck Norris. He beats everybody up, kills the wicked and stares down the worthy. He is always fast, but compared only to the really slow opponents he has to face. He is always smart, but only compared to the morons stacked up against him. But he's entertaining, unless the story sucks.And boy, does it suck here. Almost every idea put forth is ridiculous and then completely contradicted just a few minutes later. The editing is bad, there is no one even resembling having fun, except maybe Bobby Naderi. It's 100% by the numbers, a movie scam.The FBI characters are completely pointless. The Black female agent is there for quota purposes only, as she starts off as incompetent, rude and cocky and she continues to run things on the basis of her arrogance alone, thus invalidating the entire premise of the film! Or maybe justifying it, I don't know. Jeremy Irons looks the same for decades, I don't know how he does it, but in this film even his character is reluctantly doing his job, reduced from a powerful man to an acting puppet in bad situations. Minnie Driver is in this. She answers phones. That's all she does for like three scenes.Bottom line: Hollywood should have Beekeepers. The only interesting aspect of this movie is that its production seems to parallel almost exactly the plot of the film. Everything but the righteous ending.","5/10"
"siderite","31 August 2023","The idea of the first Indiana Jones movie was ridiculous, but the action, Ford's charisma and the limited options of 1981 made it great. 40 years later, a similarly ridiculous idea is still fun with plenty of action, Ford's charisma and the limited options of 2023.One of the most impressive things in the film is the beginning, where an almost seamless Indiana Jones deaging has him fight Nazis on top of moving trains amid allied bombings. Except that unlike many films before, it was not uncanny or pathetic, it was really really good. I was feeling like they somehow had stock footage from the '80s.Then there is the character of Phoebe Bridge, who is not that bad, even though pretty inconsistent. She reads as a woman with daddy issues who hasn't yet decided what kind of person she is going to be. There are no out of place jokes and she plays it all as a serious character.The other things, actors brought from the past, the child that kind of helps, but also annoys, the last Nazi gasp (considering the action of the movie is somewhere in 1970), the horse through subway routine... they were OK. I didn't feel upset by any of it.Bottom line: a fine sendoff, a lot better then the fourth entry in the series which I hope gets forgotten and almost on par with the originals.P. S. Yeah, a lot of things don't make sense, but go with it. They never did make any sense.","7/10"
"siderite","4 May 2023","I should start this review with the ending of the movie. After saving the world - again - Ant-Man is asking himself hard questions, like did he doom the entire Multiverse or not. He goes ""Nah, it's fine"" reminding himself that the world doesn't make sense and we shouldn't be asking so many questions. It was a clear jab at the people who would predictably criticize the film for its lack of meaning or consistency. It's also an advice for viewers going in, if they want to enjoy the film: leave your brain at the door.That being said, the film was a bunch of familiar faces playing characters that didn't seem to fit their history in a full CGI dream world. That is it. The movie could have just as well been an Alice in Wonderland sequel, where she shrinks and grows using magic mushrooms to kill a multiversal Red Queen. It makes no difference whatsoever.So was the film entertaining? Barely. The visuals were nice, things went pew pew and boom, had a lot of McGuffins and Deus ex Machinas, we even had entire CGI bars (and some actors) borrowed from whatever Marvel are doing in Star Wars. The story was clear, too, as nonsensical as it was. The characterization was bad, though. I mean Evangeline Lilly was barely in it (the haircut did NOT help), MODOK as Darren was pointless, Cassie was annoying as hell - that girl needs a good spanking - not taking responsibility for anything and then telling people what they should do, and Hank... Michael Douglas came, did his lines like a professional, went back home and got drunk questioning his life choices. Even Ant-Man was swinging wildly from courageous dad to hysterical buffoon. Paul Rudd did what he could with it, but it was bad.That leaves Kang. I have to say that I have a feeling every time I see Jonathan Majors on screen. It's a creepy, filthy feeling. It does not feel good. I don't know why and probably I will never know, with the personal issues the actor has nowadays and the publicity around it. But he was a good Kang. Better than in Loki, that's for sure, his acting was spot on. I feel like the script did him a disservice, because he could have easily become one of those legendary villains that makes you root for while hating him at the same time. I didn't see it in Loki, but I did see the potential of a great villain in this film. With the expected two end-credits scenes completely shattering that potential.The classic comic book villain histrionics have got to go. They don't help stories, they don't inspire anyone watching, they don't provide any useful hint for real life just a small emotional catharsis that feels shameful at the end, like a bad wank. It's a made-up fantasy of the bad guy emotionally collapsing under the weight of their defeat while heroes somehow derive strength from theirs. Is it that hard to care for your villain as you do for your hero, writers?""Kang will return"", says the last image of the film. I now doubt that very much.Bottom line: a forgettable and completely pointless film that manages to be somehow entertaining based almost exclusively on CGI and the charisma of the (poorly used) actors. Alas, that's the standard of movie I now expect from Marvel.","6/10"
"sidin","24 November 2012","When I read the book, I understood why Life of Pi was pronounced unfilmable. Most of the plot revolves around a boy and a tiger on a boat. This is one of those cases where most would say ""nothing happens"". This story which isn't blatantly cinematic didn't exactly have a formula for a great film. Its production was also jinxed as it changed directors from M. Night Shyamalan to Jean Pierre-Jeunet, an Indian-American and a Frenchman. These choices made sense since the book was written by a French-Canadian but set in the Indian backdrop. Finally, the job was handed over to Ang Lee who is neither French nor Indian. This told me how judgments could really throw you off sometimes and prevent you from discovering beauty. Lee takes on this crouching tiger and truly gives us a hidden dragon. He has always been expert at subtle drama and handling unspoken/ unfulfilled relationships with poignancy. It all ultimately fits. I would even go as far as saying the book was waiting to be filmed by him. Nobody else could have made it.Visually, the film is unlike anything your eyes have seen before. It is just utterly magnificent. Avatar, Hugo, Tintin and now Life of Pi. Few films have exhibited actual use 3D and not thanklessly indulge in shoddy gimmickry. The images composed are so strikingly rich and alive that it would work even without 3D. There would be at least 10 instances where my mouth opened and I couldn't bring myself to let out a gasp since I was choked with amazement.As most fables do, they transport you into a fantastical world while being an allegory on life. I personally love the character of Pi. He is relentless, a child of god who never ceases to give up hope. There is another character you take home with you: Richard Parker, the Royal Bengal Tiger. He isn't a cute dog that everybody in the audience falls for but a fearsome presence like King Kong. There are other wondrous creatures like a bioluminescent whale, an island swarming with meerkats and flying dorados. Magic realism on film has never been this good.Suraj Sharma is soulful as Pi. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes onto become a Hollywood movie star like Freida Pinto. Although, the performance that blew me away was that of Irrfan Khan as the older Pi. In the scene where he talks about Richard Parker, two teardrops from his eyes moved me ever so deeply. The film will be getting several nominations at the Oscars, including the big ones. But if there is any justice in Hollywood (which there isn't, as we know), Irrfan Khan should be on his way to getting an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.Mychael Danna's music is simply unbelievable. He uses Indian flutes, French accordions along with classical western violins. Pi's Lullaby (in Tamil) is achingly beautiful and it is accompanied with a gorgeous credits sequence that will make A. R. Rahman sit up with envy.I was a bit concerned about a few sub-plots in the novel and especially the preface which deals with Yann Martel talking about how he came to write this story. This preface is now a sub-plot in the film as Pi gives the story to the writer and tells him to do whatever he wants with it. That writer is Ang Lee who has taken Martel's story and improved upon it. He squeezes out certain moments from the source material and gives it a new life. The ending of the film is classic Ang Lee and stands tall as one of his best closing moments alongside Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Lust, Caution (2007). It is safe to say he is one of those few filmmakers who can film any story of any genre and still make it better than the genre's luminaries. He is one of cinema's modern masters.The question everybody will come out with after watching the film is whether it was real or not? I don't wish to go into this at all as I wholeheartedly believe Pi's tale without a single speck of doubt (I find it easier to believe than many films based on true stories). It isn't exactly believable how Sense and Sensibility, a Jane Austen novel that was fundamentally British was also perfectly filmed, not by a Briton, but by a Taiwanese filmmaker. It may seem far-fetched but it's the truth. Truth cannot be truth if it only comes out of knowledge and not experience. Life of Pi is that transcendental experience. There are many who will have issues with the film's thematic elements. Believe in god or not, but if you believe in cinema, you will surely be blessed with a gift. The word I would use to concisely describe Life of Pi is: ""beautiful"". This is most definitely one of my most favorite films of the year.","10/10"

Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment? Believe me, my girlfriend and I have a better relationship than some of the so-called romance subjects in this hyped up disaster movie. I think I have grown up and comic book characters are no longer my role models. Oh well.","10/10"
"sijibomi","6 October 2017","The dumbing down of populace has definitely been accomplished after reading these ""reviews"" from ordinary folks on the internet. How's this masterpiece savagely attacked for not been an action flick given the ""War"" in its title, but a movie like Captain America Civil ""War"", where characters joke around while fighting for what should define the MCU for the next 5 years given critical praise by the very same IMDb critics that lampoon this great movie. Yes! this movie is not a summer action flick, but it is without a doubt one of the best movies to come out this year so far. It's better than Wonder-Woman and a million times greater than ""vapid PC: Ironman Homecoming"". I am now reassured that Matt Reeves will make ""The Batman"" one of the best comic-book movies of all time. Bravo to the crew and cast!","6/10"
"Silicone54","27 April 2023","I swore off all superhero movies but I like the a-list stars Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly etc. They do lend a bit of credibility to the film. But as with all these CGI films the story is given the least amount of effort.Half way into the movie I felt like I'm watching a glorified 70's kung fu film. Its just one fight scene after another. In the end, the underdogs champion over the more powerful enemy THE END.To me the Marvel characters really only have 1 or 2 movies in them. Unlike franchise heroes like Spiderman or Batman these 2nd tier heroes are not all that interesting or relatable.","9/10"
"silicontourist","27 October 2023","It just lacked that Stephen Spielberg fantasy magic dust that made all the previous Indiana films so magical. I did however still enjoy watching it (though I agree with one of the reviewers that it was overly long for what it offered up).It lacked good jokes and humour and the script was a little scrappy and unsure, in that you never get to know any in depth background on the Dial of Destiny itself. Explanations, in films of the last few years, have been very lacking and downright diabolical stupidity of the scriptwriters; and the directors. Ford does his best and holds the film together but other than the films opening 10 minutes or so, it lacks the usual slow build up of dastardly craziness, funny people, actions and events that we have become used to in the previous outing.As a huge fan of Indiana Jones I still enjoyed it well enough that I could watch it again but, to newer viewers It may be found to be wanting in large parts of the story.","8/10"
"Silver5963","22 December 2023","I don't think I've been this bored in cinema for a while. This felt longer and more dragged out than three hours of Oppenheimer. I mean, Zack Snyder's Justice League felt less dragged out than this.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is easily the most overrated film of 2023 I've seen (I didn't see Barbie but part of me wishes I'd seen that instead).Rave all you want about the visuals but staring at those visuals for 2.5 hours on a large cinema screen soon becomes an eyesore.I have a minor personal gripe with Spider-Punk. Mostly because where I'm from in England, everybody tries to emulate the language and mannerisms of Hobie because they ""think it's cool"". It's not.The lack of Spider-Noir and Spider-Ham was felt too and that kinda knocks it down a bit.Spider-Man 2099 was incredibly predictable as a character. I don't get the hype there at all. So he's an edgy, unfunny Spider-Man, so what? He felt relatively flat in terms of character.Props where it's due, they did a great job turning The Spot into a genuine threat and not just a villain of the week. They should've focussed more on his part of the story instead of the Spider-Council side. Additionally, Indian Spider-Man was probably the best new addition in this film, as he seemed genuinely likeable and had a fun and unique vibe.The final act of this film dragged on for what felt like an hour in itself, throwing one plot twist, followed by another, then a cliffhanger but wait, there's more! Two more cliffhangers later and it's finally over. Pacing issues were prominent.And my final point, which is more of a personal preference really, but Miles Morales just isn't as good as Peter Parker. He's nowhere near as compelling and certainly not as iconic. When you say ""Spider-Man"" the default name is Peter Parker for a reason. This isn't exactly the worst Spider-Man film but No Way Home did multiversal Spider-Men better and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 and 2 sweep them all.It shocks me that at one point this film was #3 on IMDb's Top 250 films because in no reality should it be a canon event that this film ranks higher than The Dark Knight. I'm hoping in the future people will rewatch this film, realise it's not all that, and the undeserved 8.6/10 rating drops lower.","10/10"
"Silver5963","3 March 2023","Avengers: Endgame marks the end of the Infinity Saga, and is the perfect conclusion! This movie takes place directly after the events of Infinity War, at which point the remaining heroes fly to Thanos's retirement home and End his Game. But Thanos had used the Infinity Stones again to destroy the Stones! Five years later, the heroes have come to accept that half of the world's population has been wiped out, when Ant-Man suddenly re-emerges from the Quantum Realm with a cure to the Blip: Time Travel! Iron Man reunites the remaining heroes: Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Professor Hulk (who managed to become a combo of Hulk and Banner), Bro Thor (who got fat and suffers from Post-Thanos Stress Disorder), Rocket and Nebula, War Machine, and Ant-Man to go through time to grab the Stones and bring the dusted back to life, revisiting multiple movies from the past and bring the MCU timeline together in a satisfying way. Things go wrong when Thanos of 2014 intercepts 2023 Nebula and finds his way into 2023 to try one more time to get the Stones, with plans to destroy the entire universe and rebuild it in his image. Cue the most awesome final battle in cinema history with EVERY hero (even Howard the Duck is there!) This movie may be three hours long but it doesn't feel like it at all! It's split really nicely into three acts: the aftermath of the Snap, the Time Heist, and the Finale against Thanos. This movie balances comedy, action, emotional story, and visual effects so nicely, along with another great Alan Silvestri soundtrack (the music at the funeral was too much for everyone's emotions, let's be honest!)While this movie may have a few plot holes that come naturally when you do time travel movies (looking at you, old man Cap), the movie is highly enjoyable and easily equals Infinity War as a 10/10 movie. If only Marvel could make movies like this again. Roll on, Secret Wars!","8/10"
"SilverDiamond1987","27 August 2017","You know, the first chapter ""The Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a good beginning. It was a solid action adventure. A modernized version of the old ""ape"" movies. When the second movie was released, people almost loved it, so the movie got lots of praise and admiration as a brilliant movie. However, if you ask me, it was seriously dull by a lazy editing and storytelling. All those trailers and posters of the second film (apes grabbing weapons etc.) gave us a promise of lots of action and suspense, but actually it was not, that's why it was a boring movie. While the most of the second movie takes place in an ape shelter with an imperceptible story, this third movie mostly takes place in a military base! This is because the director takes the easy way out while telling us the story. The third movie is the same, maybe worse, I don't know, but I can figure out easily that why a lot of audiences felt cheated. It is because the last two movies were misleading. Look at the poster of this movie! You can see clearly a grand battle between apes and humans, but the director cannot tell us this war in a wider scale, instead, most of the movie takes place in a military base/internment camp this time, so? We expect lots of action, adventure, a worldwide battle, but we get stuck in that military base and we cannot escape from there as audiences! The film starts like ""The Predator"", but after this promise, it gets worse and worse. We get lost inside the weird plot of the movie. This movie has not a proper beginning, a proper development and a proper end/climax. It feels like a semi documentary at times, but it is not. This is not a human vs. ape story. This is a boring movie about captured apes, killer apes, apes with a good heart etc. This movie, also the previous one have a pace issue! The first chapter was perfect for this, but the last two movies have a serious pace problem. It is somewhere between a semi drama and semi documentary and an action adventure film. Also, now we have a second Apocalypse Now ""homage"" after ""King Kong: The Skull Island"", but despite Woody Harrelson is such an amazing actor, his villain character here is not intimidating, influential or dramatic. In the movie, there is always a glimpse or feeling that something is going to happen, but that moment never comes. There is a special forces unit in white who reminds me storm-troopers in Star Wars, but wait a minute! They get wasted in the plot. There is a virus danger added into the plot, but it gets ridiculous and pointless. And I have never been a fan of Caesar. Yes, he is an alpha male, he is a leader, he is not evil etc. but he is overrated. I don't adore or have admiration for this ape. He is not like Dr. Zira in the original film. In these movies, humans are depicted as villains and apes are depicted as heroes to root for, but this doesn't work here actually. Is this a sentimental movie? Will you break into tears? Hell, No! If you ask me, even Tim Burton's disappointing The Planet of the Apes version is better than these movies. This movie could have been an epic finale.","9/10"
"simon-658-238496","1 February 2024","I love tee, I like Statham-Movies, also movies with Jeremy Irons. This one is not one of those movies. Let me explain:
There are 2 prime actors (Statham, Irons) and some actors with lower profiles and famousness. The story and plot is straight: Revenge with no remorse. There is nothing else. So, one could take that simple thing and go with that and put it in a half-decent, fitting story and script that. What does not fit that script is wooden dialoges, acting and lineup based on a scrummy script and casting. There is simply too much distance and non-fittance in the lineup. Then, there are the story elements after the beginning - again, too much rotten wood. And then, the finale, which is not understandable: Is it a comical, satirical garden party with kids hunting each other or does the producer think, this can be take serous?All in all and unfortunately, a movie, that will be forgotten fast on the heap of kind of too cheap chunk... How desperate or well paid were Irons and Statham to hitch their wagon to this... ?","2/10"

"simonkie","6 December 2019","Avengers INFINITY WAR was the best in the series so my expectations were low for the follow up. This movie dealt more with substance than style and is completely different than all the other Avenger movies. Definitely the most emotional movie of the series hence why they called it Endgame. Yes it's long but the characters carry the film much more than the action does. I enjoyed the film and may watch it again sometime. It was very good and delivered a fitting end but not the type of Avenger film you would want to watch again and again. That film belongs to INFINITY WAR.","3/10"
"simplifiyourlifenow","1 February 2024","I've generally liked Statham as an actor. In my mind he's akin to Bruce Willis in his prime.This mind numbing cruedly written film is a stain on his career.One must consider this movie is made to teenagers and the mentally infirm.The acting was wooden with cheesey one liners that went out of fashion in the 1990's.The colourful monkey type creature with the South African accent near the end typified this train wreck of a movie.It was brash, unintelligent, unbelieveable action scenes where Statham carves his way through SWAT and Speicla Forces teams like they're new recruits.If I was 13 I might be in awe of his Superman like skills. However as an adult that's mastered the ability to tie my own shoe laces I watched this nonsense from start to abrupt finish like a stunned mullet.I gave it a 5 just because of the action scenes. Then thought about it more and lowered it to a 4. Then thought about it again and lowered it to a 3.It's a downward spiral really, just like Statham's possible career path.Watch this movie with a good book.","3/10"

It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice.","1/10"

"sinscopefilms","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper (2024) dazzles with its masterful cinematography. The film utilizes a mix of one-shots, medium, and full shots, with the characters artfully positioned at the center which was a standout feature of the film. These shots are rich in detail, benefitting from exceptional lighting that adds an impressive depth to each scene. The camera shots during the at night scenes are exceptionally clear, and the slow zoom-ins and outs are executed flawlessly.The cinematography is further elevated by inventive techniques, such as the seamless rotation from a 90-degree angle to a flat landscape view in the drone shots, adding a dynamic layer to the visual storytelling.The film draws inspiration from the atmospheric tones of Interstellar (2014) in its musical composition. The score is a fascinating blend of horror film elements, electronic stutters, and cinematic Hans Zimmer brass, creating an immersive auditory experience that complements the film's tone perfectly.Action sequences in 'The Beekeeper' are nothing short of breathtaking. Their realism is so striking that they left me in awe, my reaction a mix of surprise and excitement. These scenes are meticulously choreographed, echoing the intense action of Tenet (2020) while maintaining their unique flair.At the heart of the film is the protagonist, Adam Clay, a hitman characterized by his strategic brilliance. Clay's ability to think 15-20 steps ahead in order to unravel a scammer fraud scheme adds a gripping, intellectual element to this action thriller. The film, while drawing parallels with Saw X (2023), stands out with its unique narrative focused on scammer themes.I felt that The Beekeeper (2024) could benefit from a brief epilogue scene, despite its numerous strengths. Adding an exploration of Adam Clay's life after the climactic events of the film could have brought more depth to the story. This brief glimpse into his future could have provided a sense of closure to his character arc, giving the audience a deeper understanding of his transformation and the impact of his choices. A scene like that would have given the film a more complete ending and added depth to its emotional impact.In conclusion, 'The Beekeeper (2024)' is a cinematic treat, a guilty pleasure that blends masterful cinematography, a captivating score, and thrilling action sequences into a unique and memorable film experience.","9/10"

But it's still a great movie, I think people are afraid of change and new chapters,
It's entertaining with a new fresh look but still got some pieces of the old nostalgic Indians jones movies.I don't think they could make it much much better then it is, yeah maybe some things could be different but in the end, if you like Indian jones without being a grumpy person that it is affraid of a new chapter, this movie is for you.

"sjo-15","20 February 2023","It started off well. The bits set in the real world have humour and character.Then they go to the quantum realm and it falls apart. The vast majority of the film is CGI. Endless CGI. Too much CGI. Seen it all before.We are expected to care about a war happening in the quantum realm between two factions its hard to care about. We are told which side we should root for.Then at the end we are told we might have rooted for the wrong side - it might not be as simple as we thought.Then in true Marvel style something weird happens that has you questioning everything, including whether its worth it at all as they can now throw away all rules required for something to be realistic and have something we can root for, and do what they like.Paul Rudd can't save it, watchable as he is.Michelle Pfeiffer is miscast.Michael Douglas is under used, restricted largely to comic relief.The whole film is started by the actions of three characters who should know better, and if they behaved as they would in reality would never have carried out the actions that cause them all to be sucked into the quantum realm. Of course they shouldn't have been messing with what they were messing with... (Makes it even less believable).Might have worked better at 90 minutes - the length such movies used to - and should - be.","9/10"
"skam_platform","4 September 2021","I love this film, it has the correct balance of all the ingredients. For the people saying this is better than Endgame, I suppose so, but I look at it as a Kill Bill type situation. They are parts one and two of the same film and as such should be viewed as a whole. Infinity war has so much bang for your buck that Endgame if compared it way flatter, but really they are Cause and effect, setup and resolution.Brilliant, vibrant, funny, highly entertaining and unpredictable stuff.","2/10"

"skuggvarg","21 May 2023","First off: I'm a huge fan of superhero movies in general and I like both Marvel and DC, so this is not a case of taking sides or comparing with the content from the other company.I've liked most Marvel movies so having to admit that Ant-Man 3 was underwhelming is hard for me. I looked forward to it a lot but it just didn't fulfill my expectations, especially since I enjoyed the first two Ant-Man movies.I felt the plot was weak and quite weird. Something of an explanation just to introduce the concept of Kang the Conqueror. That guy definitely needed a better introduction and story, he was just too anonymous here even though I know him from the comics. They didn't succeed here.Also, the actors that played Cassie and Kang felt bad compared to the other actors.I had high hopes for the other villain (no spoilers here), but sadly they made him more of a joke and wasted his potential. In the comics he's a powerful opponent but here the director just wasted him. Bad character portrait, big disappointment.The movie definitely had cool moments and effects but overall it just didn't contribute much worth to the MCU except introducing an upcoming threat.","3/10"

A couple of legendary moments in the movie that I will never forget. Nothing has come close and I feel like nothing else ever will. Over 20 movies have led to this, and Endgame delivered big time.There really isn't much else to say. The movie is packed full of every emotion. One simply has to have made the great journey to appreciate this masterpiece. This is the peak of the MCU and I fear it will only decline, but time will tell.","10/10"
"Slarkshark","22 May 2023","Ant-Man number 3. Also, number 3 in my rank of the Ant-Man films. It's not terrible, but slightly below average, while the others were more in the average realm, or even slightly above.For some reason, the main cast just didn't seem as good. Possibly the absent of the supporting cast that was in the first two hurt them, and the new supporting cast just didn't quite measure up, other than Bill Murray's brief appearance.Kang, or at least a variant of his has already been introduced in 'Loki'. Now we get to see another Kang... Exile Kang. He who is so cruel, that he had to be exiled by the Council of Kangs. His story started off strong, but is then weakened by his eventual demise. I suppose the threat of Kang lies more in the fact there's a bunch of them conspiring together to conquer.","4/10"
"SlashedProductions","11 January 2024","Sure, it's stuff you've seen before. And maybe you've even seen it done better in other films. But Jason Statham beating up bad guys will never get old.The Beekeeper wouldn't work without Statham, and the movie knows it. It has fun with its premise and keeps a brisk pace. Last month's Silent Night was also a been-there-done-that action flick, but it didn't work as well because it was taking itself too damn seriously. The Beekeeper knows what it is and goes straight for it. Jason Statham talking about bee nonsense and protecting the hive was a hoot.I had a blast with it, and hope for a sequel. Probably objectively a 3 or 3.5 star film, but I'm awarding it an unironic 4 star for being so damn fun.","8/10"

"Sleepin_Dragon","11 June 2023","It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.","10/10"

One day a friend of his is taken by scammers, he vows to take revenge.Once again, I find myself thoroughly entertained and very satisfied by one of Jason Statham's high octane, action films.It's way over the top, and some of the dialogue is beyond abysmal, so corny, but the core essence is rather emotive, who hasn't been annoyed recently, hearing of some elderly person being scammed out of their life savings.Some of the talk about bees is honestly cringe worthy, but that's the charm of the film, it's not trying to take itself too seriously.Lots of great action scenes, very well staged, and Statham is just so cool.On the debit side, Agent Parker isn't a particularly good character, and some of the American accents are a little dodgy, Jemma Redgrave's in particular is a little dodgy.I really did enjoy it.7/10.","7/10"

I came away from the cinema feeling depressed, he's now a sad character, but fear not, Helena, the epitome of privilege will save the day.Horrible CGI effects, way too many, some of them looked awful, I can't believe some of the scenes made it through to the final cut.Ford put his usual effort in, how sad though that Indie ended this way, Disney you've well and truly done it again, that's another much loved franchise sent down the pan.I get the appeal of Fleabag, but Phoebe Waller Bridge was totally miscast, Helena was just loathsome, conceited, arrogant, too smarmy, what on Earth were they thinking?I'm genuinely stunned at how positive some of the reviews are for this movie, having recently watched Temple of Doom, and loving every minute, then watching this mess.....Sorry, I thought this was abysmal.

"slightlymad22","28 June 2023","I just got out of Indiana Jones & The Dial of DestinyThey have only gone and done it!! They have made a dull, boring Indiana Jones movie!! This is going to pain me to write.It started out great (the first 20 minutes or so) then it's just very meh as it really drags to its ending!! If you don't like what Mangold did to Logan in Logan, you won't like what he has done to Indiana Jones here. He is an old, grumpy; miserable, very depressed alcoholic, who bores his students to sleep and he has retirement forced on him.The chase sequences are clearly green screen and CGI and it really stands out!! It never feels real.Ford is game, and almost everything he does in this movie is believable. John Williams score is the best thing about this movie.Phoebe Waller Bridge is just one annoying woman, I never bought their relationship for one second, nothing feels real. None of her jokes landed and in the full movie, there was only one laugh in my screening and that was during a Raiders of The Lost Ark call back.Mads Mickelson is as reliable as ever. He always delivers, so no complaints here.It pains me to say, I'll probably never watch it again. Now it's time to drink away my disappointment.","6/10"
"slightlymad22","29 December 2019","I just rewatched Avengers: EndgameAfter 11 years, this is it.... And they pretty much stuck the landing. It borrows heavily from Back To The Future 2, and that's not a bad thing, they even mention Back To The Future.I loved Thor's hammer going to Cap (goosebumps), but I think my favourite part was when Peter Parker first sees Tony Stark, and he starts telling everything that has happened and Tony, so happy to see him, gives him the biggest hug, and despite being shocked at first, Peter cuddles into him and says ""mmmm this is nice"" I actually liked Captain Marvel in this movie. Considerably more than I did in Captain Marvel. I enjoyed Nebula too.I thought fat Thor was funny to start with, but they should have done away with it, by the midway point, the GIRL POWER scene was Cringe-worthy!! I though Don Cheadle's jokes fell flat EVERY time!! Given the situations he makes them, his jokes are awful and badly timed.There are plenty of plot holes and problems with it, The time travel was a lot of fun, but it opens up such a can of worms. Especially the ending, In End Game you can't change your future, by changing the past, as it sinply creates new timelines. Yet Cap decides to stay in the past with Peggy and grows old to meet back up with the team at the end, with all his current knowledge. I'm happy he ended up with Peggy, but it totally went against his character, are we really meant to believe he could just sit idly by as all the bad things happened around him?? It was pretty established that wasn't something he could do. He also stopped Peggy marrying the man who she would marry and have kids with. Changing his life and stopping their children being born.Finally I have to talk about Robert Downey Jr, he IS the MCU!! If the first Iron Man (which worked mainly because of Downey Jr's performance) movie didn't work, there would be no MCU!! And what a way for him to go.... ""I am Iron Man!!"" I'm not going to lie, I cried when he died, in fact I cried a few times. I think it was 4 times in total.Dear, MarvelIf you can arrange for Thor to be in GOTG Vol 3 that would be great.","10/10"

He is a great character, it is pretty much his movie. Continuing how great he was in Thor: Ragnarok, Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as Thor!! No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner.Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!! She does not really have much to do.As usual in a Marvel movie, the action is great and it nails it's humour too!! One of Marvel's best for me.","10/10"
"slydon13","21 January 2024","When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'.","1/10"
"Smarmelade","17 April 2023","Man, I was a bit excited when they announced Quantumania. I like first Ant-Man, second movie was fine as well. I like Paul Rudd... but I kinda never liked they chose Scott Lang: as THE main Ant Man. I always thought Hank Pym, Ultimate version, was so interesting and they did nothing with it. Scott Lang is a blank slate, Paul Rudd playing Paul Rudd, Ryan Reynolds style. But it mostly worked, so fine, whatever.And then I watched this and it was boring, disappointing and main characters didn't grew a bit from the first movie. Script was subpar, boring, mostly not funny or interesting. Characters are completely whatever.It's so sad to see such an expensive movie, with so many visual artists crunching through sleepless nights so you can get a dumb, uninspired and visually incomprehensible movie at the end. Visually incomprehensible to the point of I didn't care one bit for it.Maybe the worst sin though - is to have a movie with this budget, about time travel, wacky physics, etc. And do absolutely nothing with it.Big man hits small man, small man hits big man, big or/and small man shoots lasers. Repeat, hit harder.That's about the extent this whole movie goes. This movie makes dr. Strange defeating Dormammu look like a genius level fight.Story and characters are THE KING of anything, if you don't have those, you have nothing of value. As is demonstrated here.","4/10"
"smblights","1 July 2023","I read a couple of reviews, both good and bad before I went to see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and it's safe to say I was a little nervous walking in to the theater. Not only because of the mixed reviews but because it's another Indiana Jones and I didn't want the series, Ford's last one, to end in a flop with a worse result than the last one. Well I have no idea what it will make or if it will even touch close to its $294,000,000.00 budget but I was completely satisfied and actually thankful that they made it! It was all that I was hoping for, an INDIANA JONES MOVIE WITH ALL THE INDIANA JONES ELEMENTS THAT HAS KEPT ME ATTACHED SINCE I WAS A CHILD. I just do not understand that hate reviews- I think people were wanting something else altogether. Have people forget what an Indiana Jones movies was like? Action, story, adventure , good acting - ITS ALL THERE IN THIS NEW ONE- WITH FORD IN HIS 80's AND ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IT!!! If you are an Indiana Jones fan(truly) than you will enjoy this movie and be grateful that they made it and didn't retire Ford from the roll with 'The Crystal Skull'.Don't be scared about the bad reviews- Go have some fun!!!!!!!","10/10"
"sme3","3 July 2023","For the most part SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE maintains the high-quality of its predecessor while offering plenty of new experiences. The animation is beautiful and eye-popping. The story features plenty of action, some humor, and much heart. Some of the goodwill this excellent film inspires in its audience is squandered by the words ""To Be Continued."" After spending almost two and a half hours building up a complex story and concern for its characters, this film provides no resolution to any of its plot elements, making the end of the film disappointing and frustrating.Miles Morales returns for the next chapter of the Oscar®-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.","10/10"

"smirnoff103","15 March 2019","Being a Dragon Ball fan from the very beginning, I think I have seen all the DB, DBZ, DBGT, DBS episodes & movies from the franchise so far. With the extreme high score (almost 'everywhere') of this episode I was very looking forward to watch this movie, but all my expectations weren't fulfilled.The beginning of the story in this movie is a bit changed from the original story from the series, but it's not such a big deal. Broly looks physically also a bit different than what we used to, he has a scar on his cheek and chest and his jewelry is gone and replaced by a metal circle around his neck. (I have no idea why ?)The animations are (at some point) very well done, but sometimes also so badly (a bit like the DBS saga), like there are still drafts and there was not enough time to finish the movie 100%. The shading is sometimes also very poorly done. The 2D / 3D transitions are very obvious but it personally didn't bother me.The soundtrack would have been great if they have taken that ridiculous ""Go Broly Go"" and afterwards ""Go ... (somebody I won't mention) Go"" track out of it. (For a strange reason there has always be ""weird"" songs in the DB movies, with some not fitting metal / doom-metal tracks imho).The story is also very predictable (like in all the movies), but that's not a real negative point because it's always been like this. During the battle I find it pretty stupid how fast the environment could change, up to 3 times during the movie. I regret Goku isn't transforming into Ultra Instinct transformation like at the end of the Dragon Ball Super saga.It was enjoyable to watch but I preferred the penultimate episode of Dragon Ball Super or the ""Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan"" movie than this movie.","7/10"
"smitastic","5 July 2023","I saw this on the day before the official release, and unfortunately this is the worst of the 5 movies. Yes, Crystal Skull is better. The first 20 minutes, (the flashback scene), are good, and then it's downhill from there. The movie is clearly missing Spielberg's touch and the whole movie didn't feel like an Indiana Jones film. Lots of action with no memorable scenes and weak new characters you don't care about. Indy is a grumpy old man that has his goddaughter bossing him around and upstaging him at every turn. The brilliant and courageous Indy of the previous four movies, is just a dopey old man that no one would have watched in any movie. After leaving the theater I really couldn't recall anything worth remembering and had the feeling that they probably should have not made this movie at all! Should have ended it with Crystal Skull. Now we'll get Helena Indy spinoff, yay!","6/10"

"SnoopyStyle","11 May 2018","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","4/10"
"SnoopyStyle","14 April 2023","Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been basking in his Avengers fame. Unbeknownst to him, his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has been working with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) to explore the Quantum Realm. They all get pulled down into the realm. Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) had hidden her lost time there spent with supervillain Kang The Conqueror (Jonathan Majors).Critical response seems to be middling or worst. I am more in the middling camp. I still really like Scott Lang and Paul Rudd's humor. He remains the best of this section of the MCU. One does question whether he is the one to introduce the big bad of Phase 4. He is the comic relief. He shouldn't lead the universe. I think that it should be Loki. His TV show is what introduced Kang anyways and he could be the unlikely heroic lead. The MCU is becoming unbalanced as the TV shows are overshadowing its supposed superior theatrical releases.As a movie, this feels trapped in the CGI strange world of superhero green screen. It's too chaotic at times. Most of it is super CGI. Kathryn Newton is the new hottie which is a strange thing to say. I miss the baby-faced cutie of the original Cassie. I don't like Janet in this one. Michelle Pfeiffer is stuck in playing the troublesome character. After some time, I realized that she needs to be separated from Hank. They could be arguing over the experiment when it goes off. She is just set up wrong. At the end of the day, this is a pretty simple story and it's the modern-day standard for the superhero movie. It needs more of Ant-Man's humor. He's forced to introduce the next big bad of the new phase which shouldn't be his job.","4/10"
"SnoopyStyle","2 February 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is the beekeeper. Secretly, he's a retired super-assassin from an unrestricted government program. His friend Eloise Parker gets taken by a call center scam team and commits suicide. He decides to track down and take out the entire organization. He is pursued by Eloise's daughter FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman). The scam organization is led by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson) and protected by former CIA director Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons).This is like a less serious Death Wish or lesser John Wick. Statham is doing Statham. It would be better to have Verona join Adam Clay in a buddy action thriller. I get the idea of uncovering the program and choosing the morality of the situation. She feels underused when her character starts so strongly. This is slight fun. It had the potential to start another action thriller franchise, but that's unlikely now.","2/10"

The Simian flu is infecting humans turning them mute and mentally devolved. Caesar leads a team to follow The Colonel. They are joined by a mute girl and a zoo monkey called Bad Ape.There is amazing CGI work here with the ape characters. They are near perfect. This is a pretty dark episode in the Apes franchise. I like the darkness but there are some issues with the story. I don't buy any reason for Caesar to leave behind his tribe. It could only be revenge and I don't like it. I don't buy all the ape prisoners either. It seems more likely that most if not all of them would be murdered by the soldiers. I don't see them taking prisoners. When the enemy soldiers arrived in front of the compound, there was one moment of greatness that almost came to being. I wish that the enemy army is made up of apes. That would be an amazing reveal like the original's Statue of Liberty. It gets buried and the opportunity is lost. Bad Ape is an unexpected and great turn. Despite some great work, I have some issues.","3/10"

There are interesting villains. If you love the first one, you'll love second one.","10/10"
"SnoopyStyle","27 April 2019","Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don't like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes.","8/10"
"SnoopyStyle","31 August 2023","It's the last days of WWII in Europe. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) are trying to steal artifacts from the Nazis. Nazi scientist Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) discovers Archimedes' Dial amongst all the fake relics. It's years later while America celebrates the moon landing. A tired Indy is retiring from teaching. Basil's daughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) shows up looking for the Dial.One thing I don't like is the over-reliance on CG. The de-aged Indy is fine with me. There's no other way to do that opening. They can shoot the back of his head for only so long. The tech has improved to a point of acceptable. The bigger problem is the non-stop use of CG. I'm not a troglodyte. Tech moves on but it doesn't have to be that obvious and in your face. A bit of real world filming would go a long way. Stunts are more thrilling. Vistas are more epic. Everything is more real.As for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, at least she's not Kate Capshaw. I can see why they picked her, but she comes with some baggage. First, she has her sarcastic smirk which works really well in a sarcastic TV comedy. It doesn't work when Indy constantly tells her that they're Nazis. She keeps smirking at him for one of two possibilities. She doesn't believe him or she doesn't care. Neither is appealing for the character. We need to love her like we love Marion. I don't see that happening. If they picked the right actress, Helena could conceivably continue the franchise after trying to do that for Mutt. I don't see that happening either.This is a fine send-off for a beloved cinematic character. It's far from the best of the franchise, but there is nothing outright bad in this movie. It has its big action although they are all CG. Harrison is still Indy. He's having his adventures. There is a wrap-up to his personal story. There is no need to fear a return to the silly Crystal Skull or a screaming Kate Capshaw. This is fine.","6/10"
"SnoopyStyle","9 November 2013","Director Ang Lee adapts the interesting Yann Martel novel. Considering all the big name directors previously attached to the project, he does an admirable job bringing this unfilmable movie to the big screen.Pi Patel lives his childhood in Pondicherry, India with his zoo owning family. Eventually they had to sell their animals to the west, and move to Canada. They travel on a Japanese freighter with the animals. The ship sinks and Pi gets to a lifeboat with a menagerie of animals including a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.Much has been said of the great CG animals. I don't need to add more to that. The lifeboat scenes look great. Ang Lee has filmed the unfilmable. I do wish the island be more otherworldly to clue in the unrealism of the story. And the island had a more religious overtone in the book which is missing here.I also wish they filmed the real lifeboat with the people characters. A visual depiction would be much more dramatic. The violence could be cut out if they needed to keep the PG rating. In fact the ratings might be why they decided to reduce that section to a simple narration.","10/10"
"snoozejonc","2 September 2023","Indy searches for the Archimedes Dial.Like all good Indiana Jones films it starts with a thrilling action sequence and I think this one is almost up there with the best.As the plot shifts in time it plausibly shows the titular character in a place he would likely be at the twilight of his years. It achieves this with mixture of poignant moments and a moving performance from Harrison Ford. I think scenes relating to these themes are the strongest aspect of the film.Ford's delivery of one speech that references his son and marriage is for me the outstanding piece of acting in the movie. Plus the contrasting scenes of Indy at the start and finish of the 60s period is very memorable and at some points emotional.First and foremost it is an action adventure driven by a traditional macguffin search. The nature of the artefact is clever from a thematic perspective, but the adventure itself is mostly forgettable. It allows producers to fill the action quotas, tick nostalgia boxes, and introduce new characters.I think when the artefact is finally used, there feels like a big rush to end the movie in a place where there could have been a more interesting adventure. I personally would have excised earlier scenes and characters to make room for this to be expanded upon. Did it need so many chases? Did it need the underwater scenes? Did it need a certain cameo? Did it need the teenage sidekick? For me this clutters up something that could potentially have been more interesting.My expectations were low going into it, but admit to being pleasantly surprised how well certain aspects are realised. However, I think any film featuring the famous whip and fedora will always be unfavourably compared to the original trilogy, unless it stands out from its contemporaries as they did. It begs the question, if you cannot do it to this standard, why do it at all? The answer to this is 'profit' and even though it doesn't sit quite right with me, at least it is better than 'The a kingdom of the Crystal Skull'.","6/10"

"socrates99","2 December 2012","I bought the book when it was first being touted as a literary gem but then decided not to read it, so I have nothing to gauge how well Ang Lee did in interpreting the book. That said, this is one of the most endearing movies I've ever seen.My first thought having just seen it was, thank God some studio didn't get a hold of it first to do an American take on the book. This movie so deserves and demands its setting and foreign lead actors. I admit I probably would have enjoyed one of our better young leads in the role of Pi, but I'm much better off having grappled with the Indian chosen by Lee who, for some reason, populates this movie with everything from Mexicans, Indians, Japanese and Anglos to tigers, hyenas, orangutans and zebras, but not one Chinese person. I thought that a little odd but perhaps the books that way too.I saw the 2D version mainly because I was expecting some exploration of the god issue, but I was mostly disappointed in that. The talk of religion is very brief and not very interesting. What was interesting is the survival story and the boy's relationships with wild animals.I had no idea whether for the most part I was watching a real tiger or not. Let's just say that if Lee had to wait for the tiger to do everything he does in this movie, he by rights should still be out there filming. Someone with a real love for animals and an eye for their behavior clearly had a hand in making these scenes look real. And then there are the shots at sea. The sea rises in great swells and you would think Pi is actually in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific being carelessly tossed around by a violent storm; it's truly masterful, unprecedented filmmaking.Even my wife who is no friend to animals thought the movie went by quickly and was happy to have seen it.","10/10"

"SoumikBanerjee1996","19 April 2023","I think they named it wrong; the film title should have been Kang: The Caged Conqueror, The King of Multiverse, or something like that. Why am I saying that? Well, for starters, the story's been written and narrated like a prologue, more like an introduction to the freshest super villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than a movie that is solely based on Ant-Man and his heroic adventures.I would go as far as to say that the entire family of Lang was treated like supporting members of the cast, that too in their own franchise, as the narrative was too invested in giving Kang all the limelight; he has got more cool scenes to act in, he's been lent stronger dialogues, and because of all that in the end he turned out to be a character with maturity and a certain level of depth with a clear goal and purpose unlike Ant-Man or any of his kith and kin.Now, is that good or bad? Actually, it's both.On one hand, Ant-Man has been treated like a trivial addition rather than lead protagonist, but on the other hand, we've got ourselves a great new villain who stands firm and could hold his own. Suffice to say, Jonathan Majors played his part with enough conviction, and I hope and I wish the writers will give his character a fitting resolution by the time he gets his closure and his chapter comes to an end.","7/10"
"SoumikBanerjee1996","4 September 2023","Indiana Jones movies were not always about the action or the grandeur, and they also showcased significant character dynamics, convincing comedic punches and, most importantly, the quirky, over-the-top nature imbued deeply in their expositions.All the things that this newer reboot/expansion has missed out on.Now, many might argue that modern-day filmmaking necessitates a modern-day approach and new-age sensibilities, and I could have agreed to that had it not been a part of a widely celebrated franchise!When you think of an expansion, taking the reins of a beloved series, you're obliged to give the audience a fan service. There's only so much room available for amendments. I like James Mangold as a director and adored some of his previous works (Logan, Ford vs. Ferrari). I do believe he's a capable filmmaker, but he hadn't done justice here.The kind of comedy that I treasured during my visits to the previous entries of the series was nowhere to be found. Phoebe Waller-Bridge seemed like a misfit in this universe, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the pacing was also horrendous. The 150 minutes of runtime occasionally wears you down; you would feel the stretch of time, and that's not a good indication.The only positives to take away from this film are the barrage of action blocks and Mr. Jones himself. I've always cheered for Mr. Ford in this character, and I genuinely believe he was born to play this role, and he does play it effortlessly every time. This was no exception. It's such a pleasure to watch him play this character.We will miss you, Indy!","4/10"
"southdavid","10 June 2023","I really loved ""into the Spiderverse"" and so this sequel is one that I've been looking forward to for a while. I'm so happy that it doesn't disappoint and even manages to improve on almost every aspect from the first.Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is invited to join ""The Spider Society"" after helping Spiderman 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and Jessica Drew (Issa Rae) defeat a Renaissance variant Vulture (Jorma Tacccone) in her world. The Spider Society jump between universes fixing anomalies. Months later, she comes back to Miles Morales' (Shameik Moore) world, tracking The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) a villain able to utilise holes in space to commit crimes. Though specifically told not to, she makes contact with Miles and drags him to another universe with disastrous consequences.It's a great story. Clever and well thought through and allowing for great deal of both humour and pathos. There are hundreds of Spiderman variants in the film, most are played for laughs and can have little more than a few seconds screentime, but some are key, such as Hobie - The Spider-Punk variant from England voiced by Daniel Kaluuya or Spiderman India voice by Karan Soni. The main variants from the last film don't really re-appear, until the very end of the movie - with the exception of Peter B Parker - voiced again by Jake Johnson.But visually the film is a step up too, something that I wouldn't have thought possible. The blending of various different animation styles is amazingly well done. How the interactions between these characters work is staggering. It's a genuine joy to just to look at something that this much effort has gone into and is this dynamic.I can't imagine for a second that this won't be very close to my best film of the year, come December. It's certainly the one to beat.","9/10"
"southdavid","16 July 2023","Hitting a franchise again, 15 years after the last, unloved, film in it was released and 34 after the last good one, is a really tricky prospect. I didn't dislike ""Dial of Destiny"" but to say that it's the most expensive film in the franchise, it feels like the cheapest.Having come into contact with The Antikythera, Archimedies' legendary tool, at the end of the second World War, aging Professor, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is dragged into a quest to recover the other half of it by Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) the daughter of an old associate. Also after the device is Juergen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) a Nazi scientist who came to America as part of Operation Paperclip and is helping the US to win the space race. Jones quickly comes to learn that although Shaw is an archaeologist, her inspiration in chasing the dial is not altruistic.I do think, one thing that instantly worked against this film was the opening 25 minutes using the de-aging process on Ford for an action sequence in the closing moments of WW2. Despite the gargantuan amount of money they appear to have spent to achieve it, it's never that convincing and every time they gave us a close up, all I saw was the effect and it completely took me out of the film. Fortunately, that mostly goes away after we get to 1969 (apart from digital replacement of stuntmen, which again never worked). From there, the action scenes are OK, but they're a little below par relative to what you'd see in a ""John Wick"", or a ""Fast and Furious"" film.I liked Phoebe Waller-Bridge in this. She's definitely not the 'shrew' character that aspects of the internet feared she would be. Harrison Ford is great as always and is one of the last few true movie stars. I understand why Mikkelsen and the creative team moved away from screaming Nazi stereotype for the villain, but it does leave both him, and his team, as rather lifeless antagonists. Spoiler free, but I didn't mind the third act 'twist' I suppose. The principles at play are no less fantastical than 'magic god box' or 'Jesus cup'. The film though is surprisingly gore/horror free given how wild the franchise has been in the past.Overall, I'd describe the film as ""not bad"" rather than ""good"". Better than ""Crystal Skull"" but destined for a lot less cultural impact. A low-key end for an iconic character.","6/10"
"southdavid","24 January 2024","I'm not the world biggest fan of this sort of midbudget action film, the ones that seem to end up on the streaming services rather than the big screen these days and whilst ""The Beekeeper"" isn't great it's unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and some decent turns in the support cast elevate it slightly above those.When his landlady Eloise (Phylicia Rashad) takes her own life, after her life savings are stolen from her by a cybercrime syndicate, Adam Clay (Jason Statham) sets out to avenge her. Clay though is not just an ordinary vigilante, he was once a Beekeeper, a member of a special government project, highly trained and given autonomy to make his own decisions about how to progress a situation. As Clay kills his way up the foodchain, chased by Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Clay comes to learn that the syndicate have ties to government agencies, that have the resources to mount a defence against his onslaught.So, all of the good work in this is done by supporting characters, particularly Raver-Lampman, so good in ""The Umbrella Academy"", and her partner in this, played by Bobby Naderi. Their scenes together elevate the film somewhat. Josh Hutchison is having a good time too, as a higher up douchebag who believes, and with some reason, that he's untouchable. One of the problems though is that Statham's character is pretty lifeless. He's proved in other films he's capable of being charismatic but here he just waffles on about Bees every chance he gets, which becomes hilarious the further you get into the film and the more frequently it happens. You can only mumble ""Protect the Hive"" so many times, before it ceases to lose all meaning.The action is fine, if perhaps lacking something truly interesting or memorable. The CGI work isn't as good as the practical stunts, and the fighting remains a touch below something like a ""John Wick"". If briefly threatens to accept its dumb nature, during a fight with another Beekeeper and become more fun, but doesn't commit to it for long.There's probably a desire to franchise the character, like has happened with other Statham films, but I really don't think there's much more meat on what was already a modest bone.","8/10"
"Sparse","27 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes isn't the masterpiece I hoped it'd be. As someone deeply invested in the characters however, it's still a highly satisfying, emotionally- profound final chapter for the trilogy. War also compensates for its relative lack of allegory/social commentary with an intricately complex (and rather poetic) character/story structure, adding new merits to the franchise even if dissatisfying others. I've been studying/writing about the entire Planet of the Apes franchise for the month leading up to my first viewing of War. Down the line (probably when the director's commentary comes out), I'll revisit my thoughts. For now, here are my impressions.Matt Reeves returns from Dawn with equitable ambition, making this the best-directed of the trilogy, addressing all of my primary issues from the previous film. Most notably, the pacing is better than Dawn's, with the emotional core always at the forefront and never sidelined. This film still doesn't have the unrelenting momentum of Rise, but it never dragged for me, and felt shorter than 2 hours (as opposed to the 2+ hour runtime). This was enhanced by the riveting (but admittedly sparse) action sequences, especially one not far into the film, which had me on edge. The sense of scope was far more realized in this film, venturing through different landscapes while not feeling claustrophobic, and implying a massive new world of unknown territory. Overall this was an ambitious film, but it didn't innovate from Dawn as Dawn innovated from Rise- -at the time shooting in the mud and rain, now opting for a tamer, snowy environment.Visually, this is nothing short of a spectacle. The (borderline R-rated) Holocaust imagery is genuinely haunting and unsettling, and crafts a unique tone with the sci-fi premise. Chinlund's production design is more enthralling than Dawn's, even if more greenscreen was used to get the result, contradicting the ambitious physical sets from before. The cinematography by Seresin also improves here, achieving some rather interesting shots, if still less engaging than the symbolic photography from Rise. As for the CG, I'm blown away. As good as the previous films were, there were still moments in which the effects were noticeably computer-generated. In War. . . the effects are flawless--so seamless that I never once actually saw ""CGI"". The effects in here are no less than groundbreaking. Spectacle isn't everything though, as there were various, smaller directorial flaws woven throughout.For one, the title card didn't match the style of the first two films, and the highlights of the former films' titles felt shoehorned-in. Also consider the distracting Coke truck in the middle of nowhere, and the ridiculously thin layers of snow covering the tunnels. How much effort would it have taken to show the characters digging or mining through stone? I can mostly excuse these smaller flaws on merits of the meticulously- crafted story.This is the sole film of the trilogy which wasn't written or adapted from a draft by Rick Jaffa/Amanda Silver, who retrospectively had a better understanding of the franchise's allegorical implications than Reeves/Bomback (who wrote this film). Now, Reeves knows how to create a brilliantly-layered story (not sure about Bomback), but his efforts left much to be desired in the way of commentary/allegory. There are clear (and often brutal) allusions to the Holocaust, with depictions of scapegoating minorities for predicaments the accuser is guilty of. In the way of contemporary commentary, the humans are trying to build a wall which ultimately proves useless (remind you of anything?). All in all though, it doesn't reflect the series' core allegory of racism very well, presenting nothing especially insightful or impressive. The final culprits are a handful of ""Did they really just do that?"" plot conveniences, mainly the tunnels with conveniently placed holes, but where the writing actually thrives in this film is structure.In War, we're presented with an abundance of reversals/reflections on the former films' themes. Consider that for the first time since Rise, Caesar finds himself in a cage and inciting a revolution. We also see him abused with water, and fed slop. Also consider the dramatic irony/poetic justice of the virus: designed by humans, activating the speech centers/enhancing intelligence for apes, now doing the precise opposite for humans, effectively switching their roles in a quite literal interpretation of Planet of the Apes' core reversal. Additionally, Alpha Omega isn't just an easter egg--it's about this film as the end of a trilogy and the beginning of a vast mythology, accentuating the motifs within the film.Character structure in War is also impressive. For example, Caesar kills Nova's father. This draws a parallel between Caesar and the Colonel (who previously killed Caesar's family). This turn not only reflects Caesar's disillusionment with humanity, but incites another parallel with his former opponent, Koba. Note that the now-orphaned Nova is a reflection of young Caesar, growing up and learning to sign with the reverse species. The performances are strong all-around, and there's not much new to be said (also I'm butting heads with IMDb's word limit). I'll add that I really enjoyed the tragic/comedic character of Bad Ape, and that Serkis was brilliant yet again.I still find Doyle's score for Rise to be the best of the trilogy, but Giacchino manages a noticeable improvement from his work on Dawn. Though still simple in orchestration, the music feels far more realized/developed here, and some nice new themes are added to the fold. I would have liked to hear more Goldsmith sensibilities (and Doyle's themes), but what we got was fantastic nonetheless.Not long after screening this film, I wanted to watch it again. Had this movie integrated more intelligent commentary and allegorical content, this could have been the second masterpiece within the Apes franchise, next to the 1968 film. I just hope that Fox keeps their damn dirty paws off my Apes until there's another story worth telling.Score: 9/10","10/10"
"Special-K88","7 September 2023","For likely no reason other than a quick cash grab, famed archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is on screen yet again to do what he usually does: track down a MacGuffin, in this instance being the Archimedes Dial, an invaluable artifact possessing Antikythera properties. In 1969, crotchety old Indy is beset with varying personal problems, but still attempting to educate a younger generation of students until he's needed for the latest search. Oh yeah, they threw in a goddaughter for Indy, presumably to raise the stakes. A bit of nostalgia early on, but really brings nothing to the table afterwards...Mangold has a proven track record as a director, but it's unclear what he's trying to accomplish here; there isn't an exceptional story, there's little to no excitement, there's not even a truly adventurous feel which was such a key component in all of the original films. Even at his advanced age an elder, quippy Ford is still quite engaging to watch, and there are some new characters, too bad they aren't interesting and exist only to service a manufactured plot. There's action, banter, globetrotting, nice scenery, some callbacks, and other stuff, but in terms of pure entertainment where's the true value in any of it? How's this for an idea: instead of dragging down established and iconic cinematic characters in a cynical attempt to try and score big bucks with contemporary audiences who weren't even alive when they originated, just make a new movie altogether. **","7/10"
"speedycomics","10 August 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films. As a huge fan of the first Spider-Verse movie, my expectations were sky-high, and I am thrilled to say that this sequel not only met but exceeded them. From start to finish, it was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that left me on the edge of my seat.One of the standout aspects of this film is its animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI creates a unique and vibrant visual experience. The attention to detail is impeccable, with every frame bursting with color and energy. The action sequences are mind-blowing, with the characters leaping off the screen and swinging through the city with incredible fluidity. It truly feels like a comic book come to life.The story takes place after the events of the first film, and it delves deeper into the multiverse concept. Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man, embarks on a journey across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and high-stakes action, making for a well-rounded and satisfying experience.The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore reprising his role as Miles Morales. He brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and likable. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, also deliver fantastic performances, adding depth and humor to their respective roles.What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex themes and emotions. It explores the idea of identity, the weight of responsibility, and the importance of family and friendship. These themes are handled with care and resonate on a deep level, making the characters feel more human and relatable.If I had to nitpick, there were a few moments where the pacing felt slightly rushed, and some characters could have been given more screen time. However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall excellence of the film.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any fan of the superhero genre. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that will leave you wanting more. With its incredible animation, engaging story, and memorable characters, it deserves a solid 9 out of 10. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Spider-Verse franchise.","9/10"
"spencer-w-hensley","10 July 2023","Although I had many reservations about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as many Indy fans did, I have rewatched it twice since it came out for the first time 15 years ago and thought I would never say this but I like that film better than this one.The ending was horrible and it's obvious Spielberg was trying to recapture the nostalgic feel of his previous movies Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. T. and blend them into the Indy franchise but aside from the awful ending beforehand it wasn't so bad.Spielberg had a good sense of pacing and it was never boring, even the end. It was stupid to be sure but not dull.Well just when you thought Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford were going to hang up Indy's whip for good 15 years ago apparently since Lucas sold his company to Disney they didn't feel that was enough and audiences wanted more Indy so here we have number 5.Spielberg was on board initially as was Lucas but both decided to only produce and hand over creative control to different writers and director James Mangold.At first I thought it could be better. I mean after all Spielberg and Lucas were both responsible for how ridiculous Crystal Skull was but seeing how number 5 turned out I now wish they had stayed on board.James Mangold may be a good director but he's no Spielberg and doesn't have his sense of wonder and adequate pacing that Spielberg and Lucas brought in one way or another to the first four films.To be sure there is some good stuff here. Even at 80 years old Harrison still plays an effective Indy. The actual story is clever and I like what they did with it and the ending is great and ought to satisfy any Indy fan.Yet even number 4 was better so the question is where did it all go wrong?I blame it on Disney for wanting to keep money grabbing Lucas' previous properties with Star Wars and now Indy. I can understand if they wanted one more to satisfy fans who disliked Crystal Skull but the finale should have been much better than this.And while Spielberg might have thought he was doing the right thing passing the directorial touch to Mangold, this franchise needs the Spielberg touch and magic that was in the other films and in many of his others.Mangold let's scenes go on way too long and up until about the last half hour it drags and drags and you keep thinking action will pick up and move along yet it doesn't.Spielberg and Lucas made Indiana Jones to be a non stop action franchise and when they were both in charge even if there wasn't action they had enough strong character development to not keep things boring.To differentiate himself from the original creators I think Mangold is trying to focus more on character development but unfortunately aside from the welcome return of Sallah and Marion the villains are not captivating enough nor are any of the other protagonists not something I can say about the previous four films.It's a nice effort but without Spielberg, Lucas, an effective screenplay and enough actions sequences with adequate pacing for me this goes down as the weakest of the franchise.It doesn't have enough compelling action or character chemistry as the others did.If you're a die hard Indy fan who can't miss this in theaters go for it, I guess some of it does work.But die hard Indy fan or not, I think you will get more enjoyment out of streaming this on Disney Plus in a few months.I think it's time Indy hangs up his whip and we give him a break. His first four adventures had enough excitement to offer this has very little in comparison.I know Ford obviously won't do anymore Indy flicks but if Disney is going to continue to do anything else with this franchise they have got to bring something fresher and more exciting to the table.","6/10"
"spencermcook","30 June 2023","Director James Mangold has built an incredible reputation of his film quality with projects such as ""Logan"" ""Ford v. Ferrari"" and ""Walk the Line"" and even though this 5th Indiana Jones installment provides the ingredients to make fans of the franchise feel nostalgic, it doesn't live up to the standard that Mangold has worked so hard to develop. Harrison Ford shares his vintage stubbornness in a character that is seasoned physically yet equally charming, and complimented heavily by a dominant performance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The opening act teases the amount of green screen chase sequences that take place throughout various scenes, and that lack of plausibility slowly dulls what the film intends to provide as the most exciting, and attention-drawing moments of this experience. Dare I say hearing the score from John Williams was the most impressive element that stuck with me afterward, because it's the one piece that never alters from the puzzle. This is a fun family experience (though a bit more edgy) and a safe watch, however I can't help but question whether or not this deteriorates the classic nature of the franchise by reintroducing the lead character in a state completely opposite of what fans grew attached to.","6/10"
"spiderandwolf","3 June 2023","I want to go back and rewatch this movie again and again. It was so good that it has to be my favorite movie of all time now. The visuals and art are beautiful just like the first movie but this one has so many more plot twists and intense scenes mixed with comedy and it's just the perfect movie. I love how smart he is and his point in the movie, his wants and who he's trying to save it's perfect, I want a year to go by right now so I can watch the second part of the movie. Man this movie is a must watch even if u didn't watch the first movie although things are less confusing and more of wow factors if uve watched the first movie!","7/10"
"spideynw","14 January 2024","Is this movie ridiculous? You bet. Is there a lot of character development? Nope. Is it non-stop action from start to finish? Yeppers! If you are looking for a fun movie, with little depth, that just doesn't stop, this is the movie for you. If not, don't go see it.The main negative for me is the obvious DEI for the movie. White guys are of course the bad guys. The sidekick is of course a dark skinned woman. Obviously the only reason she got the part is because of her gender and skin color. The head of the CIA is of course a dark-skinned dude. Where are the Asians or Hispanics? Nowhere to be found of course.","10/10"
"spotboyfilms","7 July 2023","I really enjoyed Dial of Destiny. James Mangold is an exciting filmmaker because he is able to combine the tastes of a new millenia with the filmmaking aesthetics of greats like Spielberg and the bunch.The movie has excellent De-Aging effects. The Uncanny Valley Curve has been crossed and the de-aging doesn't look weird anymore. There are a couple of noticeable flaws still, but overall it was very impressive.The movie moves fast and checks off a lot of stylistic elements from the original trilogy. James Mangold is excellent at keeping a balance between keeping the mood of the original trilogy without making it a scene for scene ripoff. The newer characters are overall good- just falling short of charismatic- but good enough to warrant a good time with them. I like that the film doesn't refrain from fatally harming a few characters- because it keeps the stakes real and high. I hate it when in modern movies no one gets hurt- and so there are no real stakes. So, Dial of Destiny definitely delivers on the hurt.After the massive disaster that was Crystal Skull, Dial of Destiny is refreshing. The climactic battle I thought was the best part of the movie. It felt fitting for the character and I wish they had made more of a moment out of it.This movie was a lot of fun. Drags at some of the action-less scenes but not too much. I'm not sure why people are disliking it. For me its a 8/10 Minus 1 point for a Long Runtime. Make your movies 2 hrs or less guys if you want that extra point. Cheers.","7/10"
"SPZMaxinema","14 January 2024","Is this another generic action movie where things take place that don't really make sense? Yes. Is the plot ridiculous in the way that it unfolds? Yes. But I really admire Jason Statham and his ability to entertain. The action/fight scenes were noteworthy and it was a very satisfying story of revenge for the most part. I just can't help but love to see him kick some ass. It's by no means like a John Wick 4 or any other mind blowing action movie of today's time with its directing and sequences but it's not the worst I've seen either! I'm pretty glad I saw this, let alone with a date and she enjoyed it too!","3/10"
"SPZMaxinema","19 February 2023","Negatives: No Michael Peña/Luis (in a freaking Ant Man movie which he's always in), ridiculous scenes and dialogue that seemed to be written by children (I trusted you, you gave your word when he didn't know Kang at all, etc), MODOK and how dumb he was/looked and his character's lines (he did not need to be in the movie), and then playing the pronoun game earlier in the movie way too much and how they kept saying ""him, he"" etc talking about Kang just to build tension which got annoying at a certain point.Positives: Kang was a cool and powerful villain and Jonathan Majors acted very well and I can't wait to see him in Creed 3, Paul Rudd did well as Scott Lang as always and his humor worked, and the world building and effects/green screen looked really good and it was creative what they did with the quantum realm.Overall it wasn't a bad movie, the story was good but it had parts that made me cringe pretty hard. I'd much rather rewatch the first one or second one (which are more original and funnier).","6/10"
"srdjankostic91","31 May 2023","I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists. The humor throughout the film is spot-on, providing moments of levity without undermining the emotional depth of the narrative.Just go and see it!","2/10"
"ssatvaya-16480","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","3/10"

"sswilkinson","16 July 2017","I've seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell, I've seen the remake with Tim Roth, I've seen thousands of films during my life. War for the Planet of the Apes seemed to me as simply a showcase for the digital ape effects.It's full of closeups of different digital ape faces against a blurry background. Af if it's 1957 and we should be marveling at new Disneyland animatronic characters. It's full of distant shots of digital chimps scurrying around. That's most of the movie.What people are saying is thought provoking, is a simple illustration of two groups in conflict. Draw comparisons to Nazis and Jews, black and white, Shia and Shi'ite, slave and slave owner. The same ""thought provoking"" questions arise.The only difference here is that it's put into a science fiction context - what if apes were as smart as humans? Well, what if cats were? Or squirrels? Had this been an action film, I'd say OK, it's an action movie and it's fine. But it isn't. It has some action, but is not an action film. It's mostly a very slow moving, dull, inarticulate drama.Inarticulate in two ways. A lot of the apes use sign language instead of speech, and the script is not clever or intellectual. A few flashes of well written dialog come up during an exchange between the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and Caesar (digital ape) and that's all there is. Less than five minutes. The rest of the dialog is mainly focused on vengeance and war or merciful understanding. There's no complexity or intellectual stimulation here.I'm shocked that nearly all professional film critics give this movie a high rating and praise. Perhaps they all received $5,000 checks from the film studio.","8/10"
"Staffenburgen","15 January 2013","Wow. That's really the only word that comes to mind. Watching this for the first time a few days ago, I found myself in a perpetual state of awe; this movie is an absolute work of art. This will be a short review, since it's virtually impossible to say much without giving anything away. The film starts with a small introduction into the life of Pi. It explains exactly how he came to have that name, and how he came to be stranded in the middle of the ocean in only the company of a fierce Bengal tiger. The rest of the story that ensues is absolutely top-notch; I really can't give this film enough praise. The narrative is extremely visceral and interpretive, filled to the brim with symbolism, and the conclusion is very satisfying.As far as acting goes, I was thoroughly impressed. The lead actor is very strong here; he is the only actor on screen for almost a full hour in the middle, and he knocks it out of the park. Now, the truly incredible part. This film is shot in spectacular 3D and I have never seen it used better. Seriously. People in the theater were literally gasping in awe as some of the more engaging visuals flashed on the screen. The viewer is completely immersed; you feel like you're a part of Pi's universe, stranded right there with him on that boat.This is one of the year's best films. It's as simple as that. I give it my highest recommendation. RATING: 9/10","8/10"

Indiana Jones starts off trying to get the lance of Longinus and turns out it's the ""dial of destiny"" created by Archimedes to travel through time portals.Uh-HuhFlash forward 30 years and now he's a retiring professor at a university where the student body is full of disinterested hippie losers, who most likely got in to dodge the Vietnam War. Does this ever play into Dr. Henry Jones' life. Nope. Other than to say Mutt died in the war, nothing is ever brought up again. In a movie this long, you would think a little twinge of disgust for these people would be a running gag. Specifically his estranged (?) god-daughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She dresses and acts like him. You would think the powers that be would understand that perhaps she would have a moment where she wanted to be like Indy but turns out she was turned off by the result of globe-trotting for treasure. Instead, we discover she is a mercenary for fortune (and glory). Ugh. This movie stinks beyond words. Long gone is that twinkle in his eyes. He's addressed disrespectfully as ""Indy"" (you call him Dr. Jones, doll!) and now also has to tug around a street urchin Arab kid Teddy. Does this not look like ""Temple Of Doom""They're racing to get this dial before Mads Mikkelson finds it...and wants to...um...kill Hitler? So he can take over and win the war. Again...ugh.Though the stakes are cleared here than ""...Crystal Skull"" the moments are so forced to really lazy effect. It feels like the gas in it deflated maybe 30 years ago. The charm smirk in the first three flicks is gone and we are left with a guy who drinks way too much and does so very little. The heavy lifting is given to Helena who seems to developed fight skills even henchmen would covet. Where would she learn that when her Pop was mousy Toby Jones? Give us a moment where we can believe she is tough. In ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" Marion does seem like a person who can handle a fistfight in her Nepal bar. She seems so painfully neutered when she returns at the end of this flick.The production design is outstanding but made ugly and cheap by awful digital cinematography. The glossiness of hard light played like a serial are exchanged for a more modern look. Discredit that to utilitarian Phaedon Papamichael who previously lensed better projects. It all just feels cheap.Incidentally, director James Mangold's big mouth fighting back against fans on social media does have credibility. His stance was watch the movie and THEN criticize. Well, sir, I paid and watched your garbage flick and you are a terrible filmmaker. Yeah, he owes the fans a massive apology.I await the day when he goes online and blames the think tank of Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Lucas (especially this joyless hack) for this failure he dumped on paying audiences.","6/10"
"statuskuo","13 January 2024","I dunno, for me, the revenge plot will never get old. In this case Jason Statham plays a dude who gets triggered into action when the only lady who looked out for him gets offed and he goes into action. Have you ever noticed that these revenge films seem to take on an air of horror movies sometimes. Like baddies are sliced and diced away in horrific ways. The hero in this case, seems to be a supernatural entity that can't be killed.The term ""beekeeper"" in this sense means a few things. And writer Kurt Wimmer taps into the mentality of a bee hive. Suppose he got into a hobby and decided to draw parallels between the two. It gets absurd people.Director David Ayer has drawn a ton of fire for some mis-steps in the DC world, but in this world he works well. Everyone will compare this to John Wick. Which...I understand the framework looks similar but this is, to me, closer to ""The Equalizer"".The problem is that we know very little about the relationship between him and the catalyst for his vengeance. It's not catastrophic that he goes into action (a suicide). The ire falls on a party kid who is related to very powerful person. The issue is that his money is also the basis of how this powerful person got to where they are. Yes, the absurdity of the plot is very dumb. But, it's also not that serious.Statham is being pursued by the daughter of the woman who killed herself. Who also happens to be an FBI agent. Keep in mind, her Mother just committed suicide, and she's cracking wise with her partner. Fun as that may seem, it does feel odd.That said...who cares? It's silly. I mean, Jeremy Iron plays a former head of the CIA. He knows he's collecting a paycheck. As is Minnie Driver. And so forth. They know how camp this has to be.BUT, it's not campy enough. In my opinion, it needed to go full cartoon. And they try, with one last villain at the end who looks like a Street Fighter reject.This movie is wildly dumb but also...does have that so-dumb-it's fun.Turn your brain off and enjoy. Statham just likes wrecking havoc, busting chops and dispensing with comical bad guys in gruesome ways.","6/10"

The art style blew me away in the first one and it's pretty good here but not good enough for a free pass. I don't know why they had to make it so long for it to end on a ""TBC"". For me it sums up how I feel about this movie that I don't even care how this finishes, sure I'll probably watch the sequel at some point on a Sunday afternoon. The villain is hardly in the movie and it's just expecting me to sit back and enjoy the various settings and characters, which if this was the first film in this style would be enough.

"Stefan_Loves_Movies","13 February 2022","Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018) is an Animation/Action/Adventure DBZ movie, 1h40m long, directed by Tatsuya Nagamine.

It finally feels like a compelling story. The only thing that bothered me: the fighting scenes were WAY TOO LONG.Conclusion: Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018) isn't a perfect movie, but it's a step in the right direction.

"stephenmadden1982","22 August 2023","I blame myself as everytime I think I will give the MCU another go I end up even more disappointed with their latest cash in on the brands they successfully established prior to the End Game.The previous ant man films were fun with plenty of humour, the latest offering was in the main devoid of humour and followed a dull formulaic plot which felt like a poor rip off of many films that had preceded it including Star Wars. There is some great acting talent in the film all of it was wasted though. Jonathan Majors was decent in it though, albeit the post credits scene almost ruined that. All in all it suggests that it's about time that Disney ended the continued pursuit of the MCU which has long been past it's best. Sadly until audiences stop buying into it they will continue to roll out the same rubbish.","1/10"

"steveinadelaide","15 January 2024","The Beekeeper is not another typical sugary action film. It is a brutal revenge story characterised by biting social commentary and violent fights. The lead role of Adam Clay, a former operative in the secret dark government organisation called Beekeepers, is played by Jason Statham, who wears the beekeeper's hat. Adam has been left without his only friend, who was scammed online. He decides to sting the corrupt corporation that stole away his dear friend, leaving behind maimed bodies and broken secrets.David Ayer, director of macho war movies, has brought the same level of intensity to The Beekeeper. Fights between combatants are raw, with Statham as usual in his signature balletic violence. He acts like a beekeeper, protecting the hive, dealing with thugs, and methodically beating them down one by one; all of these blows hurt the system he opposes.The Beekeeper is not all fists and fights (well, not quite). Surprisingly, it weaves a complex web of themes. This means that its objective is to focus on unmasking the evils of corporate greed and their effects on people. However, Adam's fascination with bees shows how society interacts with everyone, for even little things can cause massive changes.Emmy Raver-Lampman as Adam's friend's estranged daughter and an FBI agent, and Jeremy Irons playing a chillingly charismatic CEO, give impressive performances among others who make up this cast. Raver-Lampman brings some much-needed emotional depth, while Irons drips wickedness out of every word spoken through his unique style.However, at times, this film fails to live up to its own ambitions. The story line, despite being captivating, tends to be somewhat predictable at times, while the pacing occasionally becomes clumsy, going from one action sequence to another without providing much scope for thematic exploration. Moreover, dialogue sometimes becomes clichéd, especially when too many bee-related puns come into play.However, The Beekeeper has enough energy to keep your attention. This is a movie that is not scared of getting its hands dirty in either the literal or metaphorical sense. It's a brutal bee sting of a film that makes you itch to fight for what is right, even when stung in the process.So, should you watch The Beekeeper? If you are just looking for senseless action, this one may not be for you. If you fancy violent movies that have an absurd plot yet still employ social commentary, then perhaps it may be worth your time to go and see it. Just remember, it's a Jason Statham action movie. If you've seen one before, you'll know what to expect!","5/10"
"steveinadelaide","22 July 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny marks the final instalment in the adventure franchise that began in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. James Mangold directs this film taking the reins from Steven Spielberg. It brings back Harrison Ford as our archaeologist and adventurer in his late 70s and contemplating retirement. Joining him is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, a journalist and novelist who becomes his new sidekick. We also see Antoni Banderas portraying his friend and rival, a treasure hunter. At the same time, Mads Mikkelsen takes on the role of an antagonist who is a Nazi war criminal and occultist with an insatiable desire for the mythic Dial of Destiny that holds immense power to reshape history.The movie pays homage to its predecessors by incorporating references to characters, locations, and artifacts. Alongside these elements, it injects energy and humour through Waller-Bridge's sharp-witted and sarcastic performance, impressive action sequences and stunts. The story delves into Indiana's struggle with aging.Nevertheless, The Dial of Destiny has flaws that prevent it from soaring to the heights of its predecessors. The storyline is quite complicated. It seems unrealistic, with many coincidences and contrived situations. The movie's tone feels inconsistent, shifting between serious, silly, and sentimental, without a sense of coherence. While the direction is competent, it lacks the style and vision often associated with Spielberg's work. The musical score is decent enough but fails to leave a lasting impression. The cinematography comes across as lacking inspiration. As for the production design, it's decent. But it's not remarkable. The special effects vary in quality. At times they can appear cartoonish. The editing feels choppy and unpredictable, affecting the flow of the film. The pacing is sluggish and uneven throughout. And the dialogue tends to rely on clichés and predictable lines.The Dial of Destiny cannot be considered a disaster; however, it falls short of being a masterpiece. It ends up being a forgettable farewell to a character and franchise. Some moments provide fun and excitement, but some feel boring or disappointing. It neither tarnishes nor elevates Indiana Jones's legacy-it simply exists in a way that may please existing fans without attracting ones. Personally speaking, I found myself pleasantly entertained by it.","7/10"

They did a great job of making the Quantum realm look alien, but in a good way.Now for a big negative, the interaction between Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer just seemed to stop the movie in its tracks. Gone are the happy go lucky, so glad your back feelings and now there is almost a bitterness because Janet is reserved about talking about her experiences in the Quantum realm.Aside from a couple jokes they really wasted M.

"stevencayer","22 January 2024","To be, or not to be? THE BEEKEEPER is a movie that has Jason Statham in it. There, if you know Jason Statham, I've given you all the knowledge you need for this movie and you can stop reading now. For those of you who might need a little more information, the rest is for you. This is an action movie that is the most accurate depiction of ""It's so bad it's good"". It's about Adam Clay (Jason Statham), who is retired from his job and is now beekeeping for Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), who is letting him stay in the barn. Eloise gets targeted by a phishing scam that robs all of her money. After tragedy strikes, Adam goes on a revenge rampage following the money trail, using his specific set of skills as a ""beekeeper"". It's very rare when I can safely say that I loved and hated this experience. The script is horrible, but hilarious. The antagonists are cartoony, but hilarious. The violent action is great. The non-stop bee puns are fantastic, but not for everyone. The supporting cast is actually good, involving a unique role for Josh Hutcherson, Jeremy Irons, even Minnie Driver for some reason. I enjoyed how similar it is to JOHN WICK. He's just trying to ""protect the hive"". Phishing scams are still very prevalent in today's society, and this movie is a reminder to always be careful online, unless you're friends with Jason Statham. He had a bad year last year with THE MEG 2 and THE EXPENDABLES 4, but this is definitely his niche. We just need to not take his movies seriously. If you see THE BEEKEEPER, just shut down your brain for a couple hours and enjoy the ride. I highly recommend this!","10/10"
"stevendbeard","1 July 2023","I saw Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, starring Harrison Ford-1923_tv, the Star Wars movies; Phoebe Waller_Bridge-Fleabag_tv, Solo: a Star Wars Story; Toby Jones-Atomic Blonde, the Captain America movies and Mads Mikkelsen-Doctor Strange, Casino Royale_2006.This is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones series, and supposedly, the last for Harrison Ford playing him-of course, they could still make the movies, just with a different star. The first movie was made back in 1981 so I can understand Harrison getting tired of playing the same character for 42 years. Anyway, this is a nice send off. Plot wise, there is an artifact everyone wants, in this case, it starts off in WW2 where Harrison-digitally de_aged-and Toby appropriate a magical dial from Mads and his Nazi brothers. The dial-which can literally change history-was made by Archimedes, who broke it into 2 pieces so the bad guys would have to work harder to find it-it was also hidden in different locations. Jump to the present and Phoebe-Toby's daughter-shows up to see if she can get Harrison to help her find both pieces. That's when Mads pops back up too and the fun begins with archaeologists versus Nazis in lots of chases and fights. There are a few cameos that pop up too-I remember seeing John Rhys_Davies, Antonio Banderas and Karen Allen.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 34 minutes.If you are a fan, you should enjoy it-I did-and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","1/10"
"stevendbeard","13 January 2024","I saw The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham-the Expendables movies, the Fast & the Furious movies; Emmy Raver_Lampman-The Umbrella Academy_tv, Central Park_tv; Josh Hutcherson-Five Nights at Freddy's, the Hunger Games movies and Jeremy Irons-House of Gucci, Assassin's Creed.This is an action packed Jason Statham movie and I think it's Jason at his best. Jason plays a beekeeper that takes care of bees. He lives in the barn of an elderly lady while doing his bee business-collecting the honey, etc. When she is scammed out of all her money, she commits suicide which makes Jason mad. That is when you find out that Jason is also another type of beekeeper. There is an organization called Beekeepers that takes care of things the regular police or F. B. I. Can not-or won't-handle. Jason is retired but decides to come out of retirement and use his skills to bring justice to the bad guys by tracking them down and eliminating them, one by one. Emmy is the F. B. I. Agent trying to stop Jason and Josh is the bad guy running the scamming business through several locations. Jeremy plays an ex C. I. A. Agent that works for Josh and knows how dangerous the Beekeepers are and tries to warn Josh about who he is messing with. There are lots of great fight scenes as the F. B. I., police, S. W. A.

"stevenkoenig-16040","5 May 2019","I don't understand the hype behind this movie or most of the Marvel movies. I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It's almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don't understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself ""if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing"" and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE.
The other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy's relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time.
The last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It's almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble.
Other problem with the movie:
1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield
2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it.
3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF
4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out
5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity","10/10"
"StevePulaski","22 November 2012","Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name ""Pi Patel,"" and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long life-story to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pi's father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named ""Richard Parker"" on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original two-hour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dear-life, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) I've ever sat through in a theater.Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the back-and-forth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pi's, of joy and sadness. This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true game-changers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, you'd think Christopher Nolan's modern-day Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and on-par with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful.","9/10"

But still very entertaining and packed. Movie was clean and story was good. Plus it ties to the next phase of marvel movies. I assume low reviews are because people were comparing it to some great ones as the story could have been better and perhaps some might think it's a little random.

God awful script written by someone who shouldn't be writing scripts. I usually love a good action film and the only reason I've given this film 2 stars is for Jason Statham and some of the semi-decent fight scenes.

"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","18 February 2023","Welcome back, Streamers, to this quantum realm version of Stream To Big Screen! This weekend Marvel released its third film on the little hero with a big heart, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. And, child, there is some mania going on here. If you've missed the previous two Ant-Man movies, this edition follows up with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd/Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, The Wasp), along with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), as they are forced to explore the Quantum Realm again. This time they find it's not as barren as previously thought, and they end up interacting with strange creatures and embarking on an adventure that goes beyond the limits of what they previously thought was possible. Oh yeah, they run into Kang the Conqueror as well. Let's see how it goes.Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, this is an MCU movie and it obviously should be viewed on a big screen. How much should we pay for that is the question? Here, we're on the back of two successful movies, even if not primary characters of the MCU. The most successful parts of the movie are the CGI, created characters and general realm. The small package delivers big time with those features. Honestly, if you go to Avatar just for the visuals, Quantamania definitely can can follow suit. We've seen space creatures previously in the MCU but they took it up in imagination for this one.Next to that, you know from the Ant-man genre, they are going to bring the laughs. Here there are definitely a few good laughs, but unfortunately, some moments meant to be laughs just felt corny. Even worse was the fact that they kept harping on one particular joke until the end and it never really worked from the beginning. To this point, I felt the movie lost a bit of its heart or character. It felt more like another MCU-movie instead of an Ant-Man movie. We miss you Michael Pena and TI! Anyway, that issue might also have been due to wrong edits selected or what I felt was a rushed storyline. The movie overall didn't feel rushed but something about the pacing just made it feel thrown together. Was I unprepared or were they? Who knows, but I kept feeling it. Nevertheless, the cast as a whole were very good, even the annoying daughter who unfortunately we're likely to see more of based on the thought of a Young Avengers movie coming to us in the years to come.Long story short, Ant-Man and the The Wasp: Quantamania is a solid and visually stunning movie with a rushed set up that makes the plot a bit average. Viewers will be fully entertained either by action or by the corny comedy but won't be truly wowed by the film compared to other movies in the universe. The MCU is falling victim to the Netflix virus, too much content too soon. The movie is enjoyable, but it felt like it was missing some of the previous movies' heart. Obviously, see this on the big screen at any price, but you'll be glad you saved a few bucks with the matinee.","3/10"

From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.","6/10"
"strizbiz-99429","21 February 2023","Ok, I know everyone has their own opinion, but if you take yourself too seriously, you're not going to enjoy it. If you liked the other Antman movies you might like this. Visually it's amazing, lots of eye candy. If you've read Marvel comics growing up you'll appreciate it more so than people who've never picked up a comic, I'd don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that. I enjoyed it for what it was and it definitely had a couple of cool surprises. If you're looking for a serious Oscar nomination worthy movie, go watch something else, this movie was fun and imo did it's job as an Antman movie. It had humor, action and cool cgi. Would I give it a 10? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.","5/10"
"Stskyshaker","25 November 2012","Through a movie with minimum human interaction.. Ang Lee shows humanity in its purest form.Through the incredible co-survival of a man and a Bengal tiger, Life of Pi shows us how both hopes and fears keep us going.The visual is simply groundbreaking. For moments I almost thought I was hallucinating. Many of the scenes were shot Planet Earth (the most expensive nature documentary) style, but only more stunning, in 3D, and woven together by a strong character and a beautiful story.But visual effects is far from being the only thing that makes Life of Pi extraordinary. Life of Pi is such an all-round hit. Authentic and not over-the-top acting, smooth storytelling, engrossing score.. all in all it struck me as a masterpiece not only made by masters, but also with a heart.I couldn't be more glad to celebrate this as my 700th movie on IMDb. Hope, as is Life of Pi's tagline, is what it gives me. Can't wait for Ang Lee's next movie.","8/10"
"stu-miller-353-329893","28 June 2023","Currently sat at 66% on Rotten Tomatoes as I type this. The majority of recent reviews are good, but I was worried after reading some of the caustic reviews.After just watching Dial of Destiny at the cinema, I don't understand them.Let me be as succinct as is practicably possible.Is it as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or Last Crusade? No; doesn't even come close.It is as good as Temple of Doom or Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Yes.Is Phoebe Waller-Bridge annoying? No, she's fantastic. I wasn't keen on Fleabag, but she's fantastic in this! As strong as Marion was, with the cunning of Elsa. The only people Helena Shaw may annoy are the irascible, misogynist minority of Reddit/YouTubers, that open their servile mouths to be willingly breastfed agenda-laden negativity by nay-sayers & no-marks. Helena can pack a punch & her last one is comedy gold.Is the de-aging tech in the opening sequence good? Yes and no. The more you look at it, the more it becomes a bit uncanny valley, but overall the opening sequence is exciting and brilliant, so it doesn't spoil it.Is the film too long? It depends on your point of view, but as it's Indy's final hurrah, I didn't feel that it was overlong.Is the much hyped third act any good? My favourite ending since Raiders. It's brilliant and totally unexpected. Pure bombastic fun. Hey, if you can suspend your belief for the 'power of god' in Raiders or 'interdimensional beings' in Crystal Skull, then you can easily enjoy this!John Williams' score, especially when punctuating the 'events' of the last half hour, is fantastic. Maybe not as memorable as some of others in the franchise, but so, so good all the same. His discordant painting of Voller is great.I honestly loved it, and am listening to the Original Soundtrack on Spotify as I type this, which was also released today.See it for yourself. Form your OWN opinion. I did, and am so glad.","7/10"
"StuDeb2","28 June 2023","What a great movie. They have kept it to the style of the other movies. Fast paced and action packed. Harrison Ford although now grey has still got it. I loved the story. I was so relieved as being an Indie fan it was a worry that it wouldn't be as good. Definitely worth seeing at the pictures. There are some real brilliant bits to this movie. It's quite emotional watching it. I don't want Indie getting old but he isn't immortal. We have all been on the journey with him. There is only one Indie and that's Harrison Ford. Phoebe Waller Bridge is very good. Very talented woman. Great seeing Toby Jones in this. One of my faves. As is Antonio Banderas.","6/10"

"subxerogravity","12 January 2024","Important to put it like that.This is the type of film I would expect from Statham. It reminds me of films like The Transporter and Crank but in fairness comparing The Bee Keeper to the others The Bee Keeper takes itself a little more seriously with a plot of standing up for the underdog ageist big business that makes the path of revenge this movie goes down even sweeter.Statham takes his homage of the 80s action hero to a new level of invincibility that would humble Dominic Toretto. I mean some of the action sequences were just wild from beginning to end, but I ate it up!Statham is serving up the best man meal i had for a while and its as sweet as Honey!","7/10"
"subxerogravity","17 February 2023","I thought it was good, but it was a little on the fluffy side. It has the same vibe as Thor Love & Thunder, I mean literally the same vibe, because Love & Thunder was trying to be as good as Thor Ragnarök, but lighting did not strike twice and this movie gave me the same vibe of trying to be better than Thor Ragnarök.Visually amazing, I loved how they took Ant-Man to another world, or universe is more like it. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy it looks like their trying to exploit that Marvel in Space works. Loved Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. His funny quips about being an Avenger, fighting alongside Captain America and being mistaken for the other hero named after an insect was satisfying enough for me as a marvel head to keep the continuity going.Ant-Man seemed to be a film about family and I loved that. Plus, a lot of stuff for Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfefer to do, which was perfect sense they play the original Ant-Man & Wasp. Oh and my boy Jonathan Majors as Kang, that's a decent villain.I do feel that it missed the mark. It was fun to watch but I don't see myself repeating this fun watch like I did Captain America: Civil War or the first Ant-Man.","1/10"
"subxerogravity","26 April 2019","Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!","1/10"

"suganthram","16 August 2018","Such a huge hype for this movie all these years and I prayed it shouldn't be like few of the overrated movies of the MCU. And thankfully it didn't. The movie delivered what was expected from it.Full paced action with CGI as a visual spectacle.And the anti climax was a bit of a gamble which paid off perfectly.I would have given it a 9 if not for the unnecessary misplaced humor,which the directors are still refusing to let go.","3/10"

"sujanfaster","21 March 2023","It hasn't been a great last few outing for MARVEL and combined with the streaming shows, the Phase 4 didn't really hit the mark. With Antman and the Wasp: Quantamania, MARVEL starts phase 5 and with much bigger plans ahead. Let me straightway put it out there that the title of this movie is weird and I won't be typing the full name again in this review. Also this doesn't feel much like an 'Antman' movie but it also doesn't feel specifically belonging to any kind of character.This Antman isn't really bad as most of the reviews have described it to be. The movie takes off pretty quickly on its intentions and moving into the quantum world. The how's and why's the characters get there is pretty routine MARVEL movie stuff. We get introduced to new bunch of characters in this world and to be honest it kind of feels like those weird characters from most of the Star Wars movies we have seen. Even the humour surrounding them is pretty similar. As mentioned by almost everyone the movie does pick up with the introduction of Kang The Conquerer. It doesn't come as a surprise to me especially considering how his role was put out at the end of Loki even it was for a very short duration. Jonathan Majors makes immediate impact and takes over the movie. Then its all about how the Antman family battles Kang in the quantum realm and what may be coming in the future. However all that's done in not such a convincing manner. Having said that, the movie isn't really boring but it doesn't also connect emotionally as much. The action sequences are nothing much new but some of the visual effects are pretty good which remind of Multiverse of Madness. There is barely any real world scenes in the movie and this will be a difficult watch in anywhere but IMAX.Paul Rudd does a decent job but doesn't really get much to explore the funny and witty side of character. Evangeline lily and Michael Douglas are just the passengers. Michelle Pfeiffer comparatively has a key role but it isn't an impactful one. However, it is all Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conquerer who plays an immense and intense role who keeps the movie floating. Rest of the side characters doesn't really get much to do. The new Antman is an alright universe connection vehicle at best.","7/10"

"sultan-diadem","25 January 2022","War for the Planet of the Apes, was emotionally dark, beautiful, realistic and a perfect piece of filmmaking from the brilliant director Matt Reeves.It surely is a good finishing for the Planet of the Apes trilogy. Andy Serkis and other actors did brilliant job on Performance Capture and they do deserve highest of awards.It's gripping story gives rise to possibilities of more franchises in the world of Planet of the Apes than ending the story. I was lucky enough to catch the Dhaka Premier of this film, and experienced it on Dolby Atmos hall, it was amazing, I had a great time, specially the fight and battle scenes although not very long. I loved it and I would suggest all to watch this film.All hail Caesar!","3/10"
"sumtim3s00n","25 April 2019","Jar Jar deserves an oscar compared to her. Her presence on screen makes you want to walk out. Not to mention the film is already filled to the brim with unncessary huge number of ""strong"" female characters to the point its absurd. And not cool, awesome strong female characters like Rene Russo's character, whom you believe is a bada5s and has depth.
So female Jar Jar aside (an insult to Jar Jar actually), the movie, the first half, is pretty darn good, with many great comical moments especially. Second half and especially the last third, it slows down and starts becoming the formulaic and typical hollywood film, full of empty fighting, streched out beyond all sensible constraints. The ending is also not very insipiring or clever.
Also at times it suffers from some quite bad writing. Like when Thor presents Valkyrie with Asgard as if it is this great gift to her. Remember Asgard, a majestic, wonderful city on a half waterfall, half clouds, with a rainbow and beautiful weather every day.
Asgard,that is NOW a small sh1thole of a fishing village, cold and damp 11 months out of the year, with pollution and just an overall miserable life. Who the F would want to be a queen of that ?
Anyway I dont see why it has such a high score, it definitely doesnt deserve it. Its not bad but its nothing special either with too many noticeable distractions that annoy you.","7/10"
"sundevilemily","9 July 2023","I find it weird that a movie like Ant Man and the Wasp 3 tried to make this movie like a crazy space opera film and the outcome does not work. As someone who is a fan of the first two movies as fun heist sci fi movies that did a great job at just making it be about that. This film ruins what you liked about the first two films and just see that it got turned into a bland and boring film about characters trying to stop the new supposed villain of the MCU and it also makes an interesting comic book villain Modok become a joke and one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a superhero movie.","6/10"
"sunnycielo","6 December 2023","The first few minites transported me back to the 80's as a kid, first time watching this in the school auditorium on a rainy day schedule. The excitment, the thrills, the music!! Then it all went downhill, quickly i might add. This might as well been a cameo movie for Indy because the women hogged up all the screen. And she wasn't that interesting! Who was this best friend that we NEVER heard of in all of Indys history?? Why was this women given so much screentime? Really, a time wrap, only to stay later on??? And why have this impossible plot hole of a story, at least in the other movies there was a element of realism, this just made you go """"REALLY??"" And most importantly, where was SHORTROUND????!!!! This should of been a passing of the hat for Indy bit we got slighted by this. As i women i am going to say that we do not need a women heroine in every freaking movie. Having said this, *YOU KNOW WHO* should of been more in this movie, it was all about her anyway........","6/10"
"Sunsphxsuns","30 June 2023","It's been 42 years since the release of ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in 1981. Our world has changed quite a lot since then, but not enough to dismiss the vitality and charm of what is likely Indiana Jone's final adventure. And it's a worthy one at that!""Dial of Destiny"" feels very much like a Spielberg/Lucas collaboration without the aforementioned genius duo at the helm. And perhaps this is the film's most redeeming charm: It has the look and excitement of the familiar globe-trotting universe we've come to expect for Indy and his legendary exploits. Yes, Indy is older, and far more physically and emotionally vulnerable than before. Perhaps this is art imitating life. And why not? Isn't that how life actually works?Don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you from screening this film. It's worth every dollar, and perhaps more, because it is likely the last time you'll see Harrison Ford portray this hugely iconic character.No spoilers here as usual, however, after viewing Dial of Destiny, Steven Spielberg quipped to the people seated next to him: ""Damn! I thought I was the only one who knew how to make one of these!""","7/10"
"superduperspit","28 January 2013","2012 is a great film year. Almost all the films I looked forward to delivered. However one stood above them all and that's Life of Pi. I believe this is not only the best film of 2012 but one of the best films I've seen in my life.What makes Pi great is the different way it works. On the surface, if just taking the story for what it is, it's a great film in many ways. It has a likable lead and story and manages to make a boy floating on a raft entertaining. I can't say enough about how well crafted the confrontations between Pi and Parker are. Ang Lee uses the boat as a perfect device for their head to head ""battles"".But of course, Life of Pi is more than just a great story. It is steeped with symbolism. The genius ending by Yann Martel of course gives the entire film a new face. Which Pi story was real? Of course the answer is that neither are meant to be truly real. What's important is what someone takes out of a story and what it means to them. As a film viewer this is applicable to us, listening to Pi's story or another movie's, we can interpret it whichever way we want - by whichever fits our personal code. In the early stages of the film much is made of Pi's personal beliefs (in many different religions) compared to the characters around him. His father believes in science, his mother more the heart. A man even believes in swimming pools as his salvation. This is all important because just as Pi is willing to believe in multiple religions and pick the important parts from each, one interprets Pi's story in their own way and in turn, their own life in their own way But more than just that, to me all of Life of Pi is symbolic of life. We are all boys on a raft in the ocean, braving the coming and going storms and searching for our destination. It bears mentioning that brilliantly, Pi is not going home. He's going to a foreign, new place. Just as in the journey to life, we do not go to the past, we go to an uncertain future.Regardless of whether Pi's story was real or not, what seems obvious is that Richard Parker is meant to represent Pi's internal psychi. Hearkening back to the argument about science vs the heart, Pi is the rational member on the boat and Parker is the ferocious, emotional one. One can read Pi's journey as his rationality fighting with his emotional self. Likewise one could argue the other animals on the boat if not real, represent parts of himself. The zebra perhaps is the side of him that wanted to feel like a victim after the crash, the hyena the side that wanted to flip out and get angry and the orangutan the one that thought his parents had a chance to be alive. Quickly his victim side and his family-loving side is engulfed by anger, which then recedes.One tell that the entire journey is a symbolism of life is the carnivorous island. This is an island that most people visit. The carnivorous island is when we get to a place that's so comfortable and secure, that we threaten to let ourselves get stuck there, instead of moving onto new and unknown adventures in our life. Pi has to choose whether to stay in this place and be eaten by this security of life, or to move on and he chooses to move one.The part that fascinates me the most about this story is the decision to make Parker leave, without turning back to Pi. If one accepts Parker is a representation of Pi's emotional internal self, what does his snub mean? Did Pi lose his heart and emotional self in that journey across the ocean? Did leaving the the security of the island (where he'd have been with Parker forever) require sacrificing that part of himself? Or is it that in the real world, the emotional self cannot roam free with the rational, controlled self. Just as Parker had to be caged up before they got on the ship. It took that journey on the ocean for Pi to come in touch with his animalistic self, but they could never be together in civilization and this is what breaks Pi's heart as he's telling the story.Ang Lee is simply masterful. Aside from the crafting of scenes on the ship as I mentioned, the editing is perfect. Think about the scenes like Parker eating the goat in the cage, or the animals on the boat. Every scene transition is simply perfect. Every cut to Pi telling the story is crafted perfectly. This is a film where a master is truly in control of his medium. Of course I didn't even mention the all time great visual effects Life of Pi is not only perfectly crafted and written, but it is layered with fascinating depth and psychology as a movie about life itself, choices and the meaning we take out of our lives. This is a true film masterpiece and work of art.","10/10"
"supergye","12 February 2024","Statham does not disappoint. His acting has improved over the years. As usual the fight scenes are beautifully choreographed. It looks great to see an actor who has the talent to do these himself. Makes one suspend disbelief even more. The plot is full of overused tropes, and impossible twists. That does not matter to me. I and my girlfriend were riveted to the end. The people who get by with this crime every day deserve justice. Unfortunately, the law gets in the way. Statham balances the scales. If your looking for a release from the CGI of so many superhero movies this one should provide the needed entree to satiate your hunger.","9/10"
"supermellowcali","17 October 2021","I wonder if this was on purpose: the door on the ship?!? Anyone notice?No review needed, this was an amazing movie and the only one I've rated 10 stars.But it looked to me like Pi caused the shipwreck. Most ships like that can weather a storm without sinking IF THE DOORS ARE CLOSED. But Pi left the outside door open in rough seas, which is how water gets inside the boat, which is how it sinks. Did I miss something or was that a production mistake? Why did he leave the door open?","9/10"
"SuperSlim451","19 January 2019","Broly has returned and this movie delivers on all fronts. It has the humor that you would expect from the series. Goku has his moments when he shows he isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. The story is actually engaging and the fight sequence is amazing.In the first Broly movie that turned into a trilogy it was said that Broly didn't like Kakarot because as a baby he was crying. That was the extent and it made Broly look like a mindless brute. This time he has a real story that makes sense. A story, a background that is actually pretty sad. And it went in a bit more depth about Goku's history and even Vegeta.The animation is gorgeous. Especially during the fight. It will keep you on the edge of your seat as you're wondering how each are going to overcome what's going to happen next. Frieza is just a classic villain. Just funny. Feels natural.I will say the movie isn't perfect because it isn't... but it is as good as any other animated movie I've seen in years. And this movie definitely tops all Dragon Ball movies made. Definitely worth the watch.","10/10"
"Suprab_starz1993","8 June 2023","I won't go to the details of the spectacular movie this is. This is just the perfect sequel.I am just here to explain why people are sour even when they enjoyed the movie.Because it ends without a closure.Yes, guys, I get it. You crave for more, we all deserve the end but, that 9 months wait will be worth the wait.This will be perfect than the endgame. I believe that.Every frame is a painting, the emotional dramatic scenes are important and a requirement for a better payoff.Watch it a second time and you will not be hating at the cliffhanger. You will appreciate it more. You will understand the decisions that were made to be where it is now.You are just trying to feed into your brain wanting things to have closure, the satisfaction of your time invested.Fear not, March 2024 will satisfy that even more.As for the movie, I can't stop thinking about it any less. Even after 2nd watch, I want to go few more times to enjoy only in theaters. Your brain gets happy with that art you are being able to witness in such an adorable cost.Appreciate everyone involved in this movie, appreciate the animators, appreciate the sound designers and to the writers.9.5.","10/10"
"SureCommaNot","22 February 2023","I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!","6/10"
"surfisfun","1 February 2024","Wow, Jason still kick ass in is mid 50s .The movie had me laughing out load on absurd violent moment a couple of times, i wisk they were more of those.The overall direction was so so , wt the main actress not charismatic and unappealing , like many actress recently cast in tuf roles. Her and her college are the worst 2 fbi agents cast ever.The script and dialogues where at times repetitive and uninspired. The editing also was not flowing well .The action was over the top, i liked some of it but i wish that when jason fighted large groups of people would have been tone down. Still , i loved some absurd ways some died.The Overall revange story was original, but i wish it would have been more critical of the world of USA politics and a better scripted ending.I guaranty a 99 % follow up to the Beekeeper as a cash action movie serial. Hopefully the writing and direction will be better.Another Wick style movie it is. Unrealistic one man agaist too many adversaries in scenes.","1/10"
"SusieQCP","28 June 2019","I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!","9/10"
"Susisgud","5 May 2019","It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10.","6/10"
"suvechhabose","1 September 2023","The beginning of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny sees the titular hero captured by the Nazis. When they take him away to execute him, they tie a rope around his neck and prepare for his hanging. However, an American bomb lands at their feet, and the Nazis scatter in an attempt to avoid the explosion.Once the bomb goes off, the Nazis are all dead, and the room is eviscerated from the explosion. However, Indiana Jones is unharmed, completely safe from the bomb, despite his only defense being the fact that his neck has a rope around it. Perhaps Indiana Jones surviving a nuke in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't so far-fetched now.I had to write it, it happens before anything
The building survived!Its still standing today guys , i thought bombs that big are crazy but woof.","6/10"
"sventempest","27 June 2023","This is the difference between a super hero movie having something to sell and having something to actually say.I haven't been excited about a super hero movie since having watched endgame part one and never bothering to show up for endgame part two. Eventually, the MCU stopped having stakes. It stopped havj G characters. It just became a succession of adverts for the next movie in the sequence of exhausting cookie cutter same old same old adverts for the next movie.What is obviously now going to be the spider verse trilogy, has for lack of a better word, soul.If you want to go in assuming it's empty spectacle, it can deliver in spades, entertaining and colourful, gorgeous at every second. If you want a story of found family, acceptance, love, stuggling to be your best self, it's there. But if you scratch just a little deeper, you find a scathing metatextual commentary on the destructive rigidity of canon. You find a biting social commentary on the dynamics of power, institutionalised bigotry and othering.You find, an actual damn story.Not just Generic Hero Man or Woman saves the CGI world from Generic Baddie Man or Woman, end credits sting for next film. Not just bland nothings serving up the next bland nothing ad infinitum.An actual story. A modern day fable designed to ask questions, designed to mean something beneath all the superheroic trappings. A fun romp that actually bothers to try and mean something in a genre bereft of any meaning.This is what a comic book, super hero movie, should be. Accept nothing less.","8/10"
"svhot","15 August 2017","""WAR FOR PLANET OF THE APES "" is one of those rare blockbuster movies that has managed to be intelligent and entertaining at the same time.The movie features stellar performances from Woody Harrelson and Andy Serkis. The movie is quite thought-provoking and makes us question our morals, values and ethics regarding animals and other beings that are ""not human"".

Not just the message and that regards I didn't thought it wasn't absolutely awful. In this film the role of Apes can easily be replaced any terrorist organizations in the world. Even they complaint that they are fighting for survival, for protection, society made them bla bla bla. But should we allow them to eradicate mankind? Secondly world is not so small. There is a world beyond US. So I I'm confuse. Was this movie about war between Apes verses mankind or Apes verses US. To imagine that an avalanche can destroy entire humanity is laughable. At the end I was wondering where are other humans? I was certainly expecting a showdown between Apes and Mankind. But it never happened. Overall I went in to the movie expecting 10 but returned with a 6. The good thing about the film was CGI effect. It was really goo and at no point it was over done. 3D effects were good. There were some scenes that was really intense and created tension. But overall it didn't hold onto it.Message was of the film left lots of unanswered questions.","9/10"
"sweidman-28016","4 May 2019","Avengers: Endgame (SPOILER FREE) Review:After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe. Avengers: Endgame is literally one of, is not the, most anticipated film ever. This review is probably going to be shorter since its spoiler free and I have to be vague. I should have a spoiler review up soon (Monday is apparently the day we can talk about the spoilers according to the Russo Brothers). So this is a little late. I saw it last week Saturday and just saw it again last night. I wanted to see if it had the same effect as it did on first viewing. I'm pleased to say that I absolutely loved this film and even more than Infinity War. It's a great story that brings all 22 films in the Infinity Saga to a bittersweet end. The plot is much darker than any Marvel film. The first act was a drama where they're all realizing the events of what happened and it gets a good perspective for the audience. We saw in Infinity War that it affected the superheroes and some people but it makes us all think of the entire universe. It's tragic really. This is also when we get the most character development in any of the films. We see their true feelings. Now I could go on and on about how there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone, but I would like to talk about one. I'm currently on the petition that Robert Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination or at least a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. I believe this is his peak performance and he put all his emotions into it. The scenes at the beginning and end are his best though. Some brought me to tears. It's a very emotional film and I don't know how one could go in to it with at least tearing up. So Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, amazing job with the script. No line felt out of place. Everything came off natural. And also the Russo Brothers did their finest work directing and they're some of the best right now. There's so much to say about those but that's all I can say without giving it away. Now for the technical aspects. Alan Silvestri's score was interesting and beautiful because it had the original melodies like the previous Avengers films but this time he created new melodies that, for me at least, are just as memorable as the Avengers Theme. Also my favorite score of the year so far. The visual effects were good as usual and worked well with the chaos of the action, especially the final battle. Speaking of battles some say you could leave for the action since it's all the same and there was too much going on, but I strongly disagree. There is no time to get up and leave during this film. The cinematography was at its best of the franchise with Trent Opaloch as the cinematographer. And I think I'll leave my review at that. For more content I will have my spoiler review soon. I think this was an amazing film that brings the series all together. I'm pleased to say I liked it more than Infinity War and it's my favorite film of the year just beating Us. Therefore this is my first perfect film of the year. Please go see it if you haven't. I think this film is special and one you can never forget.My Grade: A+","6/10"
"Swizords","12 January 2024","It was a good, well put together picture. Plenty of action and backstory to keep your attention throughout the entire movie. Like I said above, if you like JOHN WICK, you'll like this. It is extremely exaggerated but entertaining at the same time, just like WICK. If you expect the normal laws of the world to be true, you're in the wrong place. You should be here for the completely over top action and martial arts that Statham brings. I would like to see some more installments of this. I'm not sure on the background of this story or if it's based off of a books series but I'm all in. Ready for more.","8/10"
"swjg","15 July 2017","Saw it on opening night.My Girlfriend - An important prequel to the Charleton Heston ""Planet of the Apes"". Explains so much in the original. Fabulous special effects. Loved it.Me - Some really corny stock lines to show apes have feelings too. Action shots that probably look way better in 3D. The ending is reminiscent of Moses crossing the Red Sea.Idle thought while waiting for something to happen in the movie - the apes are nowhere near anatomically correct. But then it would have had to get an R rating instead of PG-13.I was left distinctly underwhelmed.I suspect the small audience that barely filled 20% of the theater was too.","1/10"
"sydsyc","3 July 2023","This movie is an insult to the paying audience and hopefully the last nail in Iger's and Kenndey's coffins. It is bad from start to end. Even the first part with a de-aged Harrison Ford are somewhat lame. We have all seen fights on trains in much better quality 15 years ago and the fact that it takes place during darkness in order to cover up atrocious CGI makes at even worse! Fleabag Waller-Bridge is the most despicable character they could have found! Annoying, unattractive and unfunny! Her sidekick is as bad and adds nothing to the bad plot which consists of plot holes and bad writing mixed with disrespect for legacy characters. My recommendation: avoid at Al costs!","6/10"
"synchtapper1","14 January 2024","Straightforward entertainment. A mindless romp filled w great actors acting simply. I was looking for an escape. I have to also state that had the actors not nailed the intimate moments, it would not have worked. I will also write that I would have enjoyed more screen time for Ms. Rashad and Jason. Casting everyone's perfect mom was wonderful. I wanted more. Further, the motivating factors were not developed, more of a - here eat this - kinda thing. I'd of enjoyed more backstory that may have informed her character's actions. Stunts were awesome, great choreography and acting overall. One guy played his personality disorder versus being, but it didn't interfere to much. I thought he missed a great opportunity. Looking forward to Beekeeper 2!","6/10"
"szydzio","28 December 2018","This is THE BEST Dragon Ball movie ever. Perhaps one on the best animated movie in history of anime. We have everything in this movie, intresting plot, memorable characters, amazing fight scens and even more! Every DB fan must watch this movie for sure.","10/10"
"t_n_g_s","15 August 2023","The only MCU movies I watched in the theatres are Spiderman no way home, Avengers: endgame, Captain marvel, and Guardians of the galaxy. All of these were enjoyable films so I was expecting the same for Quantumania but god nothing really got my attention.Nothing here was funny, the funniest parts was the attempts of comedy and emotions. The only humorous part of the entire thing was MODOK And the story of how Kang came to be was really generic plus thing whole thing was very forgettable, I usually remember the movie for at least a year and years if it's a memorable one but I forgot most of the thing that happened here. Me and my friend had more fun eating popcorn than watching this crapThe only thing that holds this from being the worst film I've seen {that goes to Despicable me 3} is the 3rd act climax. The action was great but Kang and Antman's climactic duel was just so dumb.Rating: 3.8/10, one of the worst films I've seen in my life.","7/10"
"ta-98251","19 February 2023","The Ant-Man series was appealing because it was a small scale Superhero movie which allowed Marvel focus on a fun, personable and acceptably comedic story.Quantumania steps away from this as it serves as the major introduction of Kang the Conqueror on the big screen. This has a positive and negative impact on the film.Kang is easily the best part of the film. He is played excellently by Jonathan Majors and for the most part, has a great on screen presence. He's by far the most menacing villain we've seen in the Ant-Man series and pretty much carries the film alongside Ant-Man.We also get to explore the Quantum realm which looks unique when compared to most other marvel properties. There was a lot about it that felt like Star Wars. For the most part the CGI in the Quantum realm looked really good but one of the sub villains is by far the worst CGI character Marvel has ever created. It was legitimately off putting.There was also a lot of exposition to try and fill us in on what happened off screen to tie the Ant-Fam and Kang worlds together. It felt like I was listening to an audio book and the explanations weren't always well thought out. Not to mention, we get another Marvel child genius pop out of nowhere.Quantumania was an average entry into the MCU. It's not as bad as some critics have suggested but not enough to get you really excited for Phase 5. Whilst the scale of the movie increased it did manage to keep some of the charm and wit that has made the series enjoyable although it wasn't as well placed in this movie.","7/10"
"ta-fb","6 March 2019","First 20 minutes was good but the remain was terrible.","5/10"
"tabuno","26 April 2023","Visually quite stunning with delightful and creative designs, shapes, and forms while the storyline is less than original without much in the way of intellectual or emotional, ethical depth of other recent Marvel movies. Apparently this movie was focused on being acceptable to a broad audience range, including young people, Quantumania loses some of its sharp refreshing focus. The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions. Yes, this movie provides an amazing backdrop or canvas and yet the substance and plot of the movie does not rise to the same level. What one ends up with is a movie with a lot of flash but less than satisfactory bite.","6/10"
"talllwoood13","6 February 2024","I saw this movie the other day and there were parts of it that were really well directed or written, however that ending was just poorly done. The casting was all over the place, it's like they had to find a balance between ""woke"" and hipster like casting. I hate the hairstyle that someone had to have agreed upon for ""Verona Parker"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Then of course the other bee keeper Jason Statham fights in the gas station just made me cringe. Just another person trying hard to embrace the 1980s style and culture but probably didn't grow up in it with her awful haircut, the jacket and anything else just made it look like they were trying too hard. However that was one of the best scenes in the movie without any doubt. In the call centers I would have rather Jason fly to ""South Asia"" and do all the destruction that he does over there as we all know where most of those scams are coming from! However language barriers and all that would be a bit difficult. Instead Jason barely drives across America. Maybe a state or two maximum and he just beats up or murders hipsters for the most part. Sure there are actual soldiers and everything but those call centers are mostly hipsters who the only time they have probably ever seen a firearm was playing Call Of Duty while they ate Doritos and drank Mountain Dew to be ""ironic"".The bad guys plot was horrible, we didn't need the 28 year old. However he played his role well to be that unlikable. I do feel Jeremy Irons should have been the actual bad guy instead. The worst thing that hipster looking kid probably did was forgetting to tip a waiter I'd look at him as. The second the movie got to the second call center it REALLY went downhill. Finally revealing how the mother got where she was and trying to link all these silly things together. It's like the movie ""The Painter"" which came out recently where the movie was good but the endings were awful. I even sat through until the end of the credits hoping we'd get a bit more but nope!The final fight was well done, it wasn't a one sided Steven Seagal fight. The fact that Jason was fighting against men he didn't intend to kill and shooting them in the body armor to knock them out was good. They even tried to implement bee facts in the movie as besides that the most we had was Jason tossing a jar of honey at someone. They had a few creative kills as well in this. I loved the bridge scene the most or when they are in the barn.The current rating of 6.5 is a perfect rating for this. It had a ton of potential to become a better movie but a different director and work on the script may have improved it. Who knows maybe in 2034 or 2044 there will be a remake. They've made them for lesser movies.","6/10"

"tankace","20 July 2017","Having now watch and the newest film of this series I will start reviewing in a reverse chronological order very movie from the Planet of the Apes series up until the original. Now to our film we follow our tribe of apes as they are in conflict with the human due to the events of the previous film and their leader Ceasar as he fights to keep his family (both actual and more broadly speaking his tribe) and after the soldiers try to invade in his home he goes on his personal journey for revenge. What I love with this film is how real is the drama for this group ,which we now follow for six years in films and we have seeing to becoming a proper society. Also the effects are spectacular and at times you forget the these creatures aren't real but actors and actresses in tight costumes! The best of them is of course Ceasar who now is a grizzled leader and he is willing to do everything in his power to protect his family and if he fails avenge it with extreme prejudice. And this single mind approach is mention by his close friend Maurice ,the best Orangutan in film history, that is very similar with that of Kompa ,the chimpanzee who is partly responsible for this conflict.As for the humans, we don't get a lot of them, this a very ape-central movie(but we humans aren't also apes so again the previous films were ape-central...whatever). However their reason to continue this fight is revealed later and it makes sense for them to try their best to exterminate the apes. Also the main antagonist played expertly by Woody Harrelson is the kind of person that is willing to do anything to in his mind prevent apes form replacing humans as the dominate species. So his actions and words though show that he is of his rockets, they at least make him a believable person in that post- apocalyptic environment.Side note here if Andy Serkis doesn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance here I will go bananas on the committee. Sorry I had to write that for I don't understand why he hasn't an Oscar yet for his work in both her and the Lord of the Rings.As for cinematography ,pase and action great and beautiful just that I have nothing else to say truly the creating team has put a lot of work in this project. One thing that shows this attention to details is who the apes communicate with out actually speaking using just body language and sign language.Over all a great film and if the series ends here I will be satisfied and Apes Together Strong.","7/10"
"taooftri","4 March 2013","This is by far the best Ang Lee's film, at least to me.I read a lot of comments about this film after watching it just yesterday. Many discussions revolve the topic on whether the animal or human version of the story is real. My view is that none of them is real.It is a film about faith. Both the animal and human versions are not real. The human version is made up. The animal version is a figment of Pi's imagination and the animals are merely metaphors. The four animals personify the 3 religions and logic that Pi has been exposed to in earlier life. This adventure allows him to find the religion that means the most to him (we all have our preferred gods). Logic - most likely represented by the orang utan - is not enough to help Pi tide through the ordeal at sea. Only the tiger - his chosen religion/faith - is able to last him the whole way. In effect, the boat is Pi, his heart; and the sea and storms are life itself. Through life, and experiencing life, Pi finds his god.What is the island? The green interwined roots of the mystic green trees most likely stand for the serpents of Vishnu and the shape of the island does remind one of Vishnu. The fact that the island gives and takes away life provides further proof that it is actually a metaphor for Vishnu.There are many other interpretations to this film but I think this is the beauty of Life of Pi. The human version of the story was made up for the two Japanese investigators and it is actually a sarcasm toward the conventional minds, which do not believe in faith and miracle but embrace only the logical.It is a film not to be missed.Bravo, Ang Lee and team!","9/10"
"tariqmk","28 January 2019","Let me be right to the point, this is an incredible new leap for DragonBall.They took an old character, a villain with no personality and made him lovable, enjoyable, deep and even stronger. The animation in this film was astounding, you can feel the thuds with every blow, and the backstory (while aspects were retconned) provided the all important context without making you feel like you want to skip to the DragonBall we all know and love.This film has masterfully muscled its way to the top of many charts, and rightfully so. I will remember watching this live in cinema for many years to come.If you are even the slightest of a DragonBall fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this!","10/10"

Ok Sony this one is PHENOMENAL! I ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second.

"taryllsbaker","18 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Karin Konoval, Steve Zahn, Terry Notary, Ty Olson, Toby Kebbell and introducing Amiah Miller.After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. (12A cert; 140 mins)There was a Rise, there was a Dawn, now there's a War. Through each instalment of this rebooted franchise we have seen the mastery of visual effects taken to new heights. 'Rise' began the story of Caesar (Andy Serkis) with an incredible response. 'Dawn' took everything that was great and expanded upon it, both in story and in visuals. 'War' continues that leap in modern filmmaking – with Matt Reeves returning to direct – and doesn't lose what made the previous films so remarkable; the characters.What makes War for the Planet of the Apes so special, along with its predecessor, is how Reeves shows us two sides to the story. Sure, we root for the apes, but in this film we feel a sense of guilt and sadness for the humans (sometimes). The battle isn't just depicted in the film, it's in your mind. As I watch, I'm conflicted. I find myself wanting someone to call surrender, but of course this won't happen. There will be chaos. There will be death. 'War' shows it all; the riveting opening sequence prepares you for what's to come, and does so stunningly.Andy Serkis has made quite a name for himself in recent years. His role as Gollum in LOTR was of course a staple in his career, but I truly believe this franchise put him in the spotlight for many. There's no doubt he's a talented actor. He brings all the intricacies of feelings and emotion into his performance, with motion capture providing a phenomenal effect. His eyes show heartbreak, rage, love. He connects to the viewer, just as the viewer connects to him. 'War' continues his winning streak, he's truly wonderful in this film.Woody Harrelson plays the leader of the human army. He's evil, but as the film explores his reasoning, we become sympathetic. This is the stem of those conflicting thoughts, and something I love about Reeves' writing. Harrelson performs alongside Serkis very well, every scene is filled with tension, their rivalry is enthralling to watch. There's been a lot of great talent chosen for this franchise, and Harrelson is definitely one of the strongest.Surrounding the two relatable leads are a cast of superb characters, ranging from Rocket (Terry Notary), to the sweet Maurice (Karin Konoval) and the kooky but fun Bad Ape (Steve Zahn). The film also introduces Nova (Amiah Miller), a young girl saved and protected by the apes. Miller is a surprising addition to the cast and turns in a delightful performance.As I mentioned, this film is visually stunning. Michael Seresin returns as cinematographer, shooting on 65mm film, capturing every scene with impeccable skill. Each shot is carefully constructed, and the sets look beautiful. The motion capture is groundbreaking, the performances are expertly implemented into the apes and the result is seamless. The same applies to the visual and special effects; which have both developed significantly since the last instalment. A large amount of the environment is created with CGI, but it's well established and fabricated enough to be wholly convincing. The sound design also has a hand in how realistic the world is, and it's outstanding.Michael Giacchino returns to the Apes franchise with a score that evolves from his previous material, amplifying his use of percussion and woodwinds, embellishing his unique style. The opening cue is a suspenseful rise of apprehension and the reoccurring motifs perform well aside the visuals throughout. It's a terrifying, huge and atmospherical score, but there are moments of true beauty as well.'War' is an impressive film and highly entertaining. But in retrospect, I still find 'Dawn' to be the superior picture. People will expect a different kind of war, admittedly I did too, however that's not necessarily the reason I felt underwhelmed. 'War' needed some trimming; it's not butt-achingly long, but there were moments where the pacing felt a little monotonous. 'Dawn' had an equal share of action and storytelling, which made the picture a lot tighter as a whole. But 'War' is still a ride of emotions. Andy Serkis is the highlight amongst many highlights.Verdict; War for the Planet of the Apes is an engrossing, visually impressive picture and a fitting end to the Apes trilogy.War for the Planet of the Apes – ★★★★ (8/10)","10/10"
"tatbtsisb","16 October 2019","Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10.","10/10"
"taurusent","20 February 2019","First of all I have to say that this movie amazing, but mainly thanks to the animation. I think is the best animation I have ever seen. Except for some CG parts which seems really unpolished, the animation is a 10.
The story is quite ok, but retelling the same old stuff for that long is not that great in my opinion. And Broly, now has a personality, wow, but it is nothing crazy or unexpected. He is better because the old Broly is a screaming beast.
But yeah, it is Dragon Ball so the complexity of characters and story are not the main thing.
And here comes my main complaint, the power levels are nonexistent and completely destroyed. For me it makes no sense whatsoever. Yeah, Super anime ruined the power levels, but now they are irrelevant 100%.
I get it, Broly is gifted, he had a harsh life etc. But so are Goku and Vegeta!! They are stronger than some of the gods, they defeated countless opponents, they trained all their life...but this doesnt matter at all.
What is the point of transforming in Super Saiyan GOD if that stupid ass Broly can handle it in his base form. Whats the point of changing hair colours every 5 minutes? Because thats how transformations felt in this movie, honestly.
It just seems a big big fan service for 10 year olds. They made Broly that strong just to have a reason to put Gogeta in the movie...it felt so so so forced.
Anyway, what can I say, it is clear that this movie was made with passion, love, and a lot of money and hard work, they ruined it with the fan service, the Gogeta thing.
In my opinion, Broly at his maximum power should have been easily handled by Blue Goku or Vegeta, to make some sort of sense...
I waited so long for this movie to see how everything becomes pointless. Goku and Vegeta should have started in Blue form because it felt like base form anyway.
It was a show, an amazing one, but it has to make at least a bit of sense to me to be enertaining.My ratings are:
Animation: 10
Storyboard: 10
Music: 9
Story: 6
Any sort of logic: 2Hope you find this useful, and maybe share the same opinion in some regards. Have a good day and enjoy the movie!","10/10"
"tavismelvin","5 June 2023","Not great but it's good. They could of made this movie about 30mins shorter tbh. There's a few things I don't like about this movie. I found it sort of stupid that in a world of Spider-Man, not one Spider-Man could catch Morales. Just found it odd. You watch a whole movie to get a Clift hanger. Which wasn't that great. I felt like we were missing a big climax that never happened. I found the characters in the first movie more funny. They sort of tried too hard on this one. The cgi comic book art is cool. I find it distracting at times and it takes away from the emotions. I don't know I just had higher expectations from what reviews were saying.","10/10"
"tavm","3 December 2012","Just watched this Ang Lee-directed film with my movie theater-working friend. He thought it was ""weird"" but enjoyed it as much as I did. I mean, it was so fascinating watching this Indian teen survive being in a lifeboat for who knows how many days with a Bengal tiger always threatening to eat him. And his later adult self telling it to an author provides some explanation for his beliefs and what have you. And the visuals, which we saw in 3-D, were so awesome! Ditto the music. I can't think of anything else to say but oh, what an experience! I really can't think of anything to say except what are you waiting for? If you like adventurous filmmaking, I most definitely recommend Life of Pi!","7/10"
"tavm","3 May 2018","If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!","8/10"

""Spider-Verse"" animated movie out currently. If you plan on watching, make sure to bring large sized bucket of joy and a fizzling soda full of adventure. Not only is the movie great to watch alone, this PG film will be a movie loved by families watching. If you enjoyed the previous, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" this will bring you into a shock with how incredible the movie is. I literally cannot stop talking about how good this movie is, the reason? Because it is one of the greatest Spider-Verse movies currently, and don't even try to get me excited for the next one because i'm already am, even with the ending cliff hanger, I am still rating this 10.","8/10"
"taylorsimon-54156","17 February 2023","The critics have fair points when they talk about the excess cgi, but it's the quantum realm - what are we expecting here? The Godfather?

It was on par with Guardians 2, a fun flick with little depth but a great night out at the movies.It would have been nice to see a little more justice done to Kang's character, but I suppose this is just the beginning.Looking forward to Kang Dynasty and Loki S2.

"TaylorYee94","2 May 2021","'Life of Pi' satisfies all the requirements a movie should accomplish. Imaginary and interesting story but not too far-off from the reality: magical setting and enhanced visual art the reality cannot provide: messages to communicate with audience. It is such a pleasure to find a gem that assures all three, mentioned above like a treasure hunt, and I have found another one right here.Plot: right in the middle of reality and imagination, a perfect recipe to create a captivating story. Movie plot has to be more exciting, dramatic, and adventurous than ordinary life, but it cannot lose grip of reality such as probability or morality. It is implied that what have actually happened in the boat might be more truthful but more hurtful and evil at the same time. That story can be good but not great. With the sprinkle of imagination of tiger, zebra, and orangutan, 'Life of Pi' finds the perfect balance between the two.Cinematography: Genius work of art. God created Earth, light, water, sky, plants, living creatures, and humans. Ang Lee beautifies all the gifts from Him in similar order God created the world. I have appreciated harmony and art created together by nature, animal, and humans. Magical, marvelous, enchanting.... I cannot praise pictures and visual arts enough with any word I know. Especially, the scene where a shoal of flying fish appears and the tiger catches tuna is groundbreaking. Lee changes the frame ratio several times to create 3D effect and to subtly hint that tiger's point of view is the same one as that of Pi. SUCH a genius move. The use of noctilucence to create mysterious and even godly ambiance is clever as well.Messages: Pi's story is indeed the story in which one can find God's presence. Lee communicates that the creator of the world and the absolute goodness exists (whoever that God may be, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, or other) to audience without preaching. 'Life of Pi' is such a consolation for me. Life does not necessarily give out candy every single time. I see vice, become the victim of evil, and even act evil sometimes. It happens, but it all depends on how I take on. Also, I can always come back to good side and heal the wound as much as I can. As Pi effortlessly tries to survive, I have to keep paddling, never losing hope among all the difficulties.","10/10"
"taz1004","30 April 2019","Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time. I said I hope it wasn't using Quantum realm because it would be repeatable. And that's exactly what happened.The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.Avengers can travel back in time where they first made the Ironman version of Infinity Gauntlet. Borrow it, defeat any villain with a snap, and return it to exact moment. Avengers of the past will understand since they did same thing when retrieving the stones.Also now everyone is Antman. Everyone can shrink, go to Quantum realm, and time travel. Nothing special about Antman now. These are just fraction of all the plot holes.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And these rivals that plot hole.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future.","8/10"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","2 June 2023","After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales(Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.You can watch this without having any prior knowledge of the original movie, the comics, or other iterations. It will tell you everything you need to know. Certain things won't have the same emotional impact, and you will have to pay extremely close attention. But they actually managed it. Your average Spider-Man movie says that a person(way too frequently a Peter Parker, about time we got some more diversity) bitten by the right spider will gain superpowers, don a suit and fight crime. This one expands that into Various animals, shows literally dozens of them, in addition to featuring some great representation(ethnic, gender, age, body size). I would have loved to see openly trans individuals, especially considering the intense reactionary backlash against a split second frame in one of the trailers. Here's hoping we'll get there in part three.This is rated PG. There is no swearing or sexuality, and violence is mild. I recommend this to everyone. Regardless of your age, you can find something to love in this. 10/10.","10/10"
"tchitouniaram","29 December 2023","Reasonably entertaining , hence the 6 stars ... To begin with , I never was a big fan of Indiana Jones movies , but somewhat simply enjoyed watching them for decent action and a very good sense of humor amid great supporting actors ... This film seems to follow in the footsteps of the previous ones , but feels kind of deflated and forced ... Like with a lot of other films now , made by famous directors with famous actors and great stories , this film's biggest mistake , it's a simple truth : humans don't get better with old age , like wine ))) unfortunately , the geriatric elite of Hollywood , just doesn't know when it's a proper time to quit ...

Unfortunately , in this instance , supporting staff is atrociously bad ... I would really like to know who in their right mind cast the female FBI agent ??? Absolutely no acting skills , and the grace of a running hippo , while trying to picture a professional agent at the peak of her form ... Pitiful and not clever .. Better films of Jason Statham shine because of the better actors refining his insane action style ... 5 stars out of respect for him...","5/10"

"tedg","8 January 2013","How is it that Scorsese can get 3D so wrong and someone like Ang Lee get it so right?Sure, there is some dimensional silliness — a hummingbird in the first few moments... a message thrown into the water that lands in our laps — but the general philosophy here is to use the technology to define *space*. Usually, we are given an array of objects, but here the goal is space itself.I have been seeing very few movies recently, but I think so far as the handling of space, this film is important — a real advance over what went before. Compare for instance the handling of the water in the shipwreck to that of ""Titantic"" or ""Perfect Storm"" or ""White Squall."" The water here is architectural, dynamic but conceived as a whole. When I've noted previous advances in the cinema of space, they have been less in the architecture and more in the introduction of height, the position of the virtual camera and the emotions evoked by how that camera moves.Following the ideas of the book about the folding of experience, story-telling and religious ecstasy, we have visual metaphoric blending of underwater, various effects on the surface of water, stars, storms and modes of fluorescence in each of these. The notion is that the story with the tiger is likely fiction, and that the 'real' story was not 'as good.' We have strong hints that this is so in the written dialog, so the cinematic notion of merging dynamics below the sea with action above the sea makes sense. This begins early in the story with a shot of the famed swimming pool after which our hero is named. Late in the shot we realize the camera is underwater. Soon, the water becomes sky.But because we have shared what came before with our own eyes, we can't unknow it. It becomes folded reality.Another example: early we see a Hindu ceremony with thousands of candles floating on water. The father-voice-of-reason says ""do not be fooled by the lights."" Shortly thereafter we have the lights on the ship moving underwater and presumably triggering the untrusted narration. These lights were previously on the surface, and it seemed to me that the same visual cues were present in these — and later — lights as those we saw in the ceremony.This sort of visual coherence is only possible now where essentially every background is a synthesized one. When you create the world, you can create it your way.So the larger framing has an underwater with the ship named after the kabbalistic (recent kabbalah, not genuine historical kabbalah) notion of truth coalescing around the most attractive story. That ship is lit — again a kabbalistic reference, and the lights morph to totems: animals, symbols and memories. The sprites used in the software to model the flow of particles under the sea is used to model the turbulence on the surface and sky. Further, an associated notion is that everything must be considered as a whole situated assembly; in story terms that is the truth of coherence; in cinematic terms it is the focus on the coherence of space.Lee has always done something like this, even in his student films about dinner tables. In ""Crouching Tiger"" the fight choreography was calligraphic and was shown that way, so this was expected. But it IS an advance in the vocabulary and should be seen if only for the cinematic thrill of being present when our imagination advances a step. Note especially how the final shot does a reverse rack where the background moves closer after his feline self has 'left him.'But it fails as a compelling narrative for me. The kid in the boat seemed too Mowgli Disney perfect and not sufficiently broken to be believable. Though the cinematic tone is well thought out, it is presented too much as reality for me. The distance in abstraction between the framing device (the adult recounting a version of the story) and the story is too close. We might have done better to have the framing bits use a different technique, and the tiger be more supernatural.We do have *some* supernatural elements: the magical whale, the storm that seizes the written story, the fact that corpses and excrement vanish from the always sterile boat. The magical island's tooth (truth). The fact that a Japanese ship packs a survival manual in English. But these are plot points, not parts of the world. Tarsem Singh might have done better in this regard.We can assume that the 'alternative story' was shot, because you wouldn't hire Gérard Depardieu for one part of one scene. Perhaps we can see it in a recut version. Hey, if Decker can be a replicant in later versions of ""Bladerunner,"" maybe Anandi can be a life-dancer, the real narrator.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","10/10"
"templar77099","10 February 2018","Well, that was a bit of a letdown. It´s not a bad film by any means, but my whole perception of the trilogy is now not as untouchable as it was. I might have to rewatch ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"", but, apart from the effects and the performances, specially Andy Serkis - he really is out of this world - there's not much else to hold the film, that really suffers from a thin plot where many incongruences can be found. Its what you'd expect from a tentpole blockbuster but it can elevate itself beyond that so keep that in mind if you're gonna give it a watch.","5/10"
"teodoreh","2 May 2019","There was so much hype about this movie. The social media made a good deal of fuzz about the ticket records it broke, its length etc, etc.To start with the obvious: It's not a bad Marvel Movie. But it's surely not the best. Regarding the script and the pace, I think it reminds me something like Avengers 2 and Thor 2 and that's not the best movies Marvel made.To me, Thor 3 is the best movie of all Marvel Universe, because it has a super good balance between action, dialogs, script, and humor. You never felt bored, you never felt you knew what's coming.On Endgame, sometimes I felt bored. It was a combination of medicre editing, script or acting. For example, fat Thor joke wasn't halve as good as bad haircut Thor. The scenes that should produce laughs, were between average and good.Although 3 hours long, it failed to show the extension of misery the planet has fallen into. In the opening scenes they easily kill Thanos, next scene misery, third scene hope, fourth scene Stark rejects the idea of time travel, next scene he finds the solution, next scene, the machine is ready. It's the very same Tony Stark that on Iron Man 2 spend half a movie trying to figure out how to create a new element.Time travel movies are always problematic because no matter how much mumbo jumbo terminology you add, the truth is that no matter how the heroes avoid to interact or change the future, their own existance on the past will change their universe. So, Endgame can laugh about Hot Tub Time Machine, but the truth is, it is still a HTTM movie.. ;DAlso, it's disappointing to continiously upgrade Thor's powers and on the final battle scenes, to take them back without a proper explanation. Thor easily defeated a Thanos that was on the maximum of his powers using the Infinity Gauntled on Infinity War, but on Endgame, he's unable to beat him even without Thanos having full power! That's silly.Yes it's a huge movie and even with 30 second cameos from top actors like Robert Redford or Michael Douglas you should need 1 hour for all characters but in the end, it's not about how many people you will squeeze into the movie. It's about how you will build a good pace with balanced action and humor.Maybe it's about the fact that everybody pretty much knew how things would end while on other movies like Thor 3, things were a bit more chaotic. Maybe it's because there wasn't much time about showing the details of a 5 year period. Maybe it was the fact that the first memory that jumps into my mind every time I recall the movie is Black Widow standing on a desk and coordinating x-avengers. Maybe is the fact that Thor from an arrogant young person, became super-strong in 5 movies (Thor 1,2,3, Avengers 1,2) and then, back to mediocre again. Maybe is the fact that Hulk was portrayed like the Beast from X-Men now. Maybe it was because we never got answers from the previous movie, like what Loki meant when he talked about the sun rising again, or why Hulk refused to help Banner. Even on this movie, Hawkeye becoming a renegade, makes no sense. All heroes that presented a second chance (Stark, Thor, Hawkeye) react like ""Nah, I will pass"" instead of be super-excited about it. I know 5 years passed, but the movie fails to show how this period changed our heroes.Thanos final fight on Infinity War, much inferior to that of Endgame.
Humor much much inferior to Thor3.Of course it is not a bad movie, but it could epic - and despite all those Anchorman cameos, it's not. But I guess, when you have limited time to repeat a wordwide success, surely you will have fails now and then.Endgame was destined to be an epic ending. It was. But only 8 out of 10.","8/10"

"TerrificTom","9 February 2024","I'm afraid too many people don't know what a genre movie is.It's a movie with a very specific audience in mind and it caters to that audience, almost to a fault. In a genre movie certain things MUST happen and certain things CAN'T happen! These are NOT up for negotiation. Think: EVERY Hallmark movie EVER made. Does the girl ever NOT get the guy? Is the guy EVER a Bad Boy or a Bad Boy by the end of the movie? NEVER. I'm not even sure Hallmark movies EVER have bad boys! I'm only familiar with Hallmark Christmas movies because that's what my mother had on 16hrs a day from Thanksgiving to Christmas and if we visited you couldn't escape them.Well, this is an Action Genre movie and it hits just about EVERY cliche it MUST hit to fit into that genre and the RING is satisfying! Maybe one or two were missed but I didn't notice. The ones that do hit are hit HARD bringing real satisfaction!I forget. Does HE die in the end? Cuz that can happen in a genre movie.Who cares? If he did they can always resurrect him for the sequel! It happens in genre movies all the time. Why? Because when an audience decides it LIKES the hero, they want to see him again. And again. And again, etc., etc., ad infinitum! Genre movies and genre books are NOT ""literature."" There are no unwelcome or unwanted surprises in a genre story, UNLESS they are reversed before the final curtain.The challenge this puts on the writer and director is massive. They must find a way, against all odds, to make something unoriginal and formulaic LOOK original and innovative, without really originating or innovating anything. Now I admit, all of this sounds bad to the over-educated and highbrow among us - genre movies are what Martin Scorsese was talking about when he ripped on the MCU - but it doesn't have to be bad at all. If it can be done WELL. Hundreds of millions of people LOVE genre stories. Writers, producers, and directors have made untolded BILLIONS of dollars from them. Because when they succeed at the impossible, the millions and millions of action genre fans will reward them with word-of-mouth advertising and their film will make MONEY. Sometimes a LOT of money!I said all that so that if you identify as a fan of the action genre, this movie is definitely worth your time. But then, if you are a real action genre fan, you already intend to go see it!So go. Because you will enjoy it as much as I did.","9/10"
"Tessa11","9 May 2018","Unfortunately, computer-generated mayhem is much more important than character development. One-liners is not good writing. There was such hope with the Dr. Strange movie and nice writing....but this ""Avengers"" film does nothing to add to any of the previous characters' story lines...especially Dr. Strange. It's a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it's constant grinding noise. All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it. It's sad when money drives a movie rather than writing. Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn't mean it has to be on screen at all times. I thought SE was supposed to be light-seasoning...not complete coverage.The offering lacks in so many ways. Sad...had high hopes.","7/10"

"tfminfl","13 January 2019","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","8/10"
"tfoxk1","18 July 2017","The focus of the film is entirely from the perspective of the Apes. Humanity is devolving into mindless, mute, psychopaths. Only two human characters receive any character development, Woody and Nova. Nova realizes humans are garbage and tries to become an ape. A nice reference to the original, amazing Planet of the Apes with Nova's name. The naming should have been more creative than having an ape name her from the discarded vehicle badge from a Chevy. I left once the avalanche destroyed the human Army. Like Woody, I kept hoping humanity would survive the war of the apes. This movie turned the United States, US military, mankind, logical movie plots, and the original masterpiece into a travesty. The CG was at least good.","6/10"

The story itself is a bit thin but when you accept that it's not really about the main stars in the title, but KANG and Janet, you can really see what they're trying to do and that is to establish the new narrative going forward and everything it entails. Overall, KANG will be a very formidable foe for everybody. Looking forward to the rest of phase 4 and 5 and finding out Kang's motivations for doing what he does and why he does it.

It's cheesy, in the extreme. It's chock full of the usual tropes and character motivators that plague Marvel films. It feels like we are being force fed the same story, over and over, in all their films. Most of the characters are unlikeable, shallow and forgettable. I stopped caring about any of them about 20, yawn inducing, minutes in. This is not good film making. Loud colours, over the top character dynamics and a weak plot, do not give you a good film.

"The_Film_Auditor","29 April 2019","No spoilers!!Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not.","8/10"
"The_Film_Cricket","25 November 2012","Oh! And what a life it is! What a visual masterwork that Ang Lee has brought to the screen. Here is a story brimming with excitement, adventure, poetry, and the strange whims of drifting destiny. Here is the story of one life, one extraordinary man and his adventure to find himself and his way back home. It is based on a best-seller by Yann Martel, but it reminds you of the kinds of stories by Rudyard Kipling. It's that good.Life of Pi tells the life story of an Indian boy named Pi (Suraj Sharma) whose father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, India. We meet him in a series of opening passages that have a tone all of their own. He was born with the name Piscine, a word which, when translated from French to English means ""swimming pool"", but his parents overlook how the word looks on paper and so everyone calls him by an unflattering euphemism for urination. He silences their mockery one day in the classroom by demonstrating his wizardry at mathematics by showing them the constant of 3.14. From this, he shortens his name to Pi. We follow his upbringing as he comes to questions the nature of religion, settling on theories of Muslims, Hindus and Christians, trying to get a grasp on his purpose in life. His mother wants him to explore, but his father wants him to be more practical and real. These are lessons he will take with him all through life.The zoo starts losing money, so Pi's father informs the family that they have to sell the zoo and move to Canada. They pack up their belongings and a few of the animals and board a Japanese freighter bound for their new home. Then one night a storm hits that is so ferocious that it could have come from the Bible. Pi falls into a 25-foot lifeboat and the freighter sinks. All on board are apparently killed but Pi finds himself briefly sharing the lifeboat with a zebra with a broken leg; a seasick orangutan; a hyena; and an ill-tempered Bengal tiger that turns the other animals into lunch (not to worry, it happens off-screen). Pi builds himself a raft out of oars and life-preservers and sits tethered to the boat until he can figure out how to deal with the tiger who has taken up residence in his boat.Much like Robert Zemekis' Cast Away much of this movie deals with one man's fight for survival. The two are similar in their observations of trying to deal with survival under limited conditions, but this one takes place almost completely at sea. Pi tries to keep himself hydrated with rainwater and freshwater that was stored aboard the lifeboat, and with the few rations that he has. He also tries to keep the tiger – named Richard Parker – nourished with fish that he catches with his bare hands. He knows that the beast will eventually get hungry enough to turn on him if he doesn't keep its belly full.The relationship with the tiger is not what we expect. Pi has several chances to let the beast drown or starve to death but he refuses. He admits, in his journal (which makes the excuse for voice-over narration), that the tiger is giving him instincts that he never felt before, like a new sense of alertness. What is so brilliant about the relationship is that Ang Lee never makes the mistake of making the tiger sentimental. This isn't one of those bond-with-animal movies from Disney. Lee never takes away the tiger's savage nature and that brings the story tension and a sense of grounded reality. A bond does form but it is more out of respect for the situation. Their final moments together are as real as they are touching.That reality is necessary because the film occasionally breaks away from the real world and allows us some moments that are surreal, like a visit to a living, breathing island that seems prepared to have Pi and Richard Parker for lunch. Visually the movie is breathtaking. There are shots here that are not just computer effects but are shown just to allow us some moments of pure beauty. One shot in particular takes place underwater as we are looking up at the boat with the sky behind it. There doesn't seem to be any water there and Pi seems to just be floating on air. The CG effects here are miraculous, especially in giving life to the tiger. He is a savage beast, yes, but eventually we see him as Pi sees him, and we come to like him without finding him cuddly. This is a movie that respects animals by not making the mistake of trying to humanize them.What happens in the film's final act is a question left to the viewer over the validity of what we have just seen. There are many questions to be raised about those moments and many that are difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. The ending will illicit many deep discussions afterwards.To watch Life of Pi is to observe how few films really consider their characters, how few consider the spiritual journey of the adventure they are undertaking. A lot of films are about journeys of violence or revenge but can hardly be bothered to deal with what the characters have learned. This movie is so much more than that.","9/10"
"the_mysteriousx","31 July 2023","This seems to be the last Indiana Jones film with Harrison Ford. I certainly hope they do not make another, even with another actor. Indiana Jones was created in the late 1970s as a homage to movie serials of the 1930s. This character, therefore, is tremendously out of place in the 2020s. No one living today really remembers the 30s and the 1980s were a very long time ago now. James Mangold, however, has succeeded in giving the movie serials of yesteryear a fitting ""Goodbye"" with this film.The core theme in Dial of Destiny is about what happens when you get to the end of life and I think the somewhat depressing nature of that reality is why the film hasn't done what was expected at the box office. Younger audiences not embracing it is not surprising - they want something fresh and new. The last Indiana Jones film came out in 2008 and you need to be at least in your 20s to remember seeing that in the theater. When you combine that with the mystifying fact that Disney has owned this character for 10 years and done absolutely nothing to promote it (Disney never even bothered putting it on Disney + all these years until now!!) makes it easy to see why only fans who watched these films in the 1980s were the ones who primarily saw Dial of Destiny in the theater. I don't think most people under 20 give a thought as to who Indiana Jones is. It's going to make about $400 million and when you stop and think that any film with an 80 year-old lead can do that, it's pretty amazing honestly. Why did Disney think a franchise with no new material in 15 years and with an 80 year-old lead could do a billion?!?!Indiana Jones, the character, is out of his element in 1969. American culture has completely changed from his heyday in the 1930s. Harrison Ford plays a lonelier version of the adventurous character. He is not a family man and never settled down, so we see him at the end of his job as a professor and retiring to his small apartment in New York City with no real plan for what to do with his remaining time. This is when adventure comes to find him one more time.His goddaughter, with unknown motives, tracks him down during one of his final classes and is looking for the Antikythera mechanism, a real artifact discovered in 1902 off the namesake Greek Island. It's entire purpose and design are still a mystery and the film goes big on this. I won't spoil it, but the ""magical power"" of this device gives the Indiana Jones character an opportunity for a poetically appropriate finale. Indiana Jones has always been a passionate student about history. I was very happy to see him embrace this passion in a way he never could in the previous films. Mangold succeeds in delivering a final story arc for Indiana Jones.There is a good deal of action, but really 3 main set pieces - the train scene of 1944; the horse chase in NYC and then the chase in Morocco. Other moments rely more on suspense than action and this is a smart and logical way to deal with Indiana Jones, who is supposed to be about 70 years-old in this film. Ford is simply terrific in his iconic role. He nails the emotions of this character without the nostalgia or self-pity that would be so easy to instill. It was nice to see John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen have solid moments of support. The other actors were all excellent with Mads Mikkelsen making a terrifically deplorable villain, who has a major bone to pick with Nazi history.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is far from perfect, but it's a terrific closer for Indiana Jones. Disney is who failed this film. Indiana Jones should have been promoted by them for many years and the budget was simply bloated. The cast and crew should be proud of the film. The filmmakers honored Indiana Jones, the original vision of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and the serials that inspired them as children.I have a feeling this film will gather admiration with time. As age and reflection on life are the main themes and as we all get older, more and more audiences will identify with what Indiana Jones has to go through in the film. Thank you, Harrison Ford, and Thank you, John Williams, for everything.","10/10"
"The-Sarkologist","14 May 2013","They said that this was the unfilmable book, and, well, this and countless of other films also fall into that category (such as Cloud Atlas, which I plan on holding off seeing until I get around to actually reading the book, though I have since seen it because I could watch it on the plane), and I would also suggest that maybe books like Ulysses and To the Lighthouse also fall into that category (I know they have made a film out of To the Lighthouse, but since I am writing this at 38000 ft and have no internet access, I cannot comment on Ulysses – yep, they have).For those who have not seen this film, you will know it as the film about the boy who is trapped in a life boat with a tiger. Actually, many of you that have seen this film will probably say the same thing, I know I will. In fact, it is amusing sitting on the plane and looking around at the other seats to see who else is watching it (and the fact that I am stuck in this flying coffin for eight hours, I might as well watch it, but I do draw the line at Cloud Atlas – which I ended up watching anyway, and quite enjoyed it). Anyway, enough of me rambling, let us talk about the film.Visually it is beautiful, but having never read the book I cannot comment on whether it actually catches the themes of the book all that well. Based on the film, and the story that is told at the end, I suspect it is about how one struggles with one's animal instincts and the desire to remain human. When trapped alone, out of touch with the rest of humanity, it is believed that one will no doubt descend back into an animal nature.It is an interesting thought though, that the only thing that keeps us civilised is the existence of other people. The reason I raise this thing is because there are two stories, and one of them involves the boy stuck in the boat with the tiger, but this is a metaphor, in a sense. The boy is, well, the boy, and the tiger is the animal urges that are trying to take over the boy's mind. However, how do we know that that actually happens. Maybe there have been studies, maybe there hasn't.However it is not simply about controlling one's humanity because, in a sense, we also have a scene where boy saves the tiger's life, and we question whether that, in a sense, is his desire not to let go of his animal nature. In a way this struggle, as he says, keeps him alive. Maybe it is the case that by killing the tiger he kills himself. In a way, it could be the animal instinct finally winning, so by showing the tiger kindness, and mercy, one retain's one humanity, whereas by killing the tiger, one sinks and becomes lost in one's animal instincts.","8/10"
"The-Sarkologist","25 April 2023","After a number of rather dull Marvel movies (and series) they have finally released something that actually kept me interested right the way through. Okay, it does seem that it hasn't been received all that well, and it also seems that it hasn't met the box office targets that were estimated, but a part of me feels that maybe, just maybe, people has started to become somewhat bored with the whole idea of the superhero film. Mind you, that probably has quite a lot of do with the success of Endgame, so, yeah, I'm somehow not surprised.However, I actually really liked it. It is basically a science-fiction film, but it takes place in the universe of the Quantum Realm. This is a place that has been teased in previous films, but never really explored. Now that the Thanos arc has been completed, it is certainly time to return to this realm and actually see what is down there, and personally, I thought they did a really good job with that as well.So, the film begins with Scott Lang simply enjoying life, though honestly, it reminded me an awful lot of the opening to Spiderman III. However, things turn a bit sour when his daughter, Cassie, ends up in locked up because she was protesting the eviction of homeless people in the park. After a family discussion, it is revealed that she has been experimenting with mapping the Quantum Realm, though it turns out that Janet hasn't been telling anybody what she discovered when she was trapped in the Quantum Realm, and as such they are all sucked into it, and need to find a way to escape. However, while they are down there we are introduced to the next big bad guy in the series - Kang the Conquerer (though we did meet him once before at the end of season 1 of Loki).I have to say that Jonathon Majors was absolutely outstanding. He really played the character well, and gave us a taste of what this new villain was going to be like (though recent events may change that somewhat). Mind you, unlike the previous cycle, where we are slowly being introduced to the main villain of the piece, in this one, we meet him almost straight away, then the films give us an idea of the nature of the conflict. Actually, another thing that I've noticed is that they have pretty much told us what all of the films are going to be, and the titles of them as well. However, it does sort of make me wonder if we are coming to the end of the Marvel era.As I said, I actually really liked the film, and there are definitely people out there that agreed with me. I personally thought that the whole sci-fi aspect to it, an also exploring the quantum realm is basically what attracted me to the film initially, and I have to say that it certainly did not disappoint, at least where I'm concerned. However, if there is one definite gripe that I did have, and that was with Modok - that just looked so horrible, surely they could have done better than that with all of the experience that they have.","4/10"
"The-Sarkologist","28 August 2023","You know, come to think of it, I almost feel as if the third Indiana Jones film sort of gave me the impression that it would be the last - especially with a title like 'The Last Crusade'. Mind you, I guess Ford really did want to give it one last crack, especially since he has pretty much said that he is retiring as an actor. In fact, him retiring as an actor, and Jones retiring as a university professor, does fit the character well, and apparently there had been plans to actually release four sequels.Anyway, the film starts during World War II, where Jones and Basil are attempting to retrieve some artifacts from a train heading to Berlin. They believe that the Nazi's have procured the Spear of Destiny, that is the spear that was used to pierce the side of Christ, but as it turns out that it is a fake. However, another artifact has been uncovered - the Antikythera device, which is apparently a lot more powerful.Actually, I was quite thrilled to discover that this whole movie was focused around the device, which was recovered from a Roman wreck off the coast of the island of Antikythera. Apparently it is said to have been one of the earliest examples of a computing device. Mind you, this is Indiana Jones, so of course this device ends up being more than a simple calculating machine.Look, I did like the film, though I have to admit that the chase scenes sort of start to get pretty boring, especially when there seems to be one after the other, and they drag out for way too long as well. However, one think I did like is that there were hints in the film as to what was coming up, especially with the puppet play that they encounter in Sicily. However, there were some problems, namely with one of the explanations as to how they landed up where they did at the end of the film. Honestly, continental drift has nothing to do with it. The other thing was how did the bad guy's find them in Sicily so quickly - I thought they had been given the wrong co-ordinates.Still, other than that, yeah, it was a fitting end to the Indiana Jones films.","7/10"
"The-Sarkologist","29 July 2017","In a way I'm not all that surprised that they have now released a third film in the reboot series. A part of me was thinking that maybe they are prequels, but when you consider that the original films created a time loop where apes from the future come to the present, and then give birth to a race of sentient apes, the whole prequel idea really doesn't seem to work. Further, it seems to be a movement away from the original remake, which was actually set on another world on the other side of a black hole. It seems, thus, that they have gone back to the drawing board and have have come up with these prequel reboots, for want of a better word.The problem with these series is not so much not seeing the previous films, but having seen them so long ago that one actually forgets what happened. While they do give us a bit of a recap, this film is unfortunately not one that can simply stand alone. Still, considering the fact that it was a full house when I saw it suggests that there is some popularity with the franchise. As for me, I simply saw it because I had seen the previous two, even though there was really no burning desire for me to actually go out and see this sequel.The film starts sometime after the previous film and the apes are being tracked by a militia. During one such even Caeser's wife and son are killed, so he decides to go off and seek vengeance against the killer. However, he also sends all of the other apes off to find a new home, though this doesn't work out all that well as they eventually end up being captured by the humans and put to work as slaves. Caesar also gets captured, and the film simply descends into what is basically a prison break film. Sure, there are a few twists and surprises, but in the end it is basically a film sit in a prison, where the prisoners happen to be apes.Honestly, I have to say that when I sat down to watch this film, other than feeling rather cramped in my seats, I pretty much asked myself why it was that I was actually watching this film. In part it was fun, but in the end it really just seemed to drag that little too much. I guess the whole premise of sentient apes going to war against humans, and the humans slowly dying off in favour of the apes, is something that seems to have been done to death in the past. I really didn't grab my attention, and for most of the time I was just sitting there quite restless. Maybe, just maybe, if videoshops were still around I'd be waiting for these films to come out on video where I don't have to watch it in one sitting, but since I am too stingy for Netflix, and do other things at home as opposed to watching films, I guess seeing movies of this quality is going to be what the future holds.","2/10"
"TheBigSick","10 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel to the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The film is plagued by pacing issues, a reliance on clichés, and a lack of focus.The film's biggest problem is its length. At two hours and twenty minutes, it feels like two movies crammed into one. The first half of the film is slow and meandering, with too many subplots that don't really go anywhere. The second half of the film is much better, but it still feels rushed.Another issue with the film is its reliance on clichés. The theme of family is particularly overused, and it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling too short.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.","6/10"
"TheBigSick","26 April 2019","The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long.","8/10"
"TheBigSick","4 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes. The film is just too long, and you keep looking at the watch to see when it will end. There are too many characters, and if you did not view the previous Marvel films, you would hardly get any sense of who they are. It is an OK film for Marvel fans, but chaos for a general audience.","6/10"
"thebosontheory","27 July 2017","After I watched this film I saw endless reviews giving the film a 1 out of 10 and I honestly do not understand them at all. I walked into the cinema knowing that I was about to watch a good film due to the success of the previous two, but I didn't realize how good this was going to be!The films grabs you straight away with a fight against the military and the apes and show you where the two factions stand and what has happened since the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. After that the film never drops in quality or entertainment. When you think about it, the story is pretty basic - bad guy kills family member, protagonist wants revenge, gets revenge - simple. But when watching the film you don't even realize how simple it is because they execute it in such an amazing way. In all fairness I was quite disappointed in how the Colonel died. This is the only reason I am giving this review a 9 and not a full 10. I was expecting a big fight scene between him and Ceaser but he ended up killing himself instead? There were so many moments in the film where I was almost in tears, especially at the end when the Apes finally found sanctuary and Ceaser had passed on. The writers did an exceptional job with this scene and didn't make it over dramatic or anything like that and I love them for that.The CGI is again, outstanding and flawless. I have honestly never seen a film with better CGI and Andy Serkis really benefits that with his incredibly performance yet again. The character development in the film is also amazing. Once again Maurice was wise and stuck to himself making him still my favourite character of the franchise. But coming into to a VERY close second is the new character Bad Ape. I've never fell in love with a character more with his shyness and him just being so darn cute with the things he does and says.I've read loads of reviews of this film saying ""there was no war"" or even ""there was no combat"". Well I genuinely think they were watching another film because for a solid 30 minutes the military base is getting blown up and shot down by the enemy.Overall, I believe this film was by far the best film of the franchise and you should all ignore the public reviews that people have posted on here and listen to the Metacritic score of 82 which I think is absolutely spot on!","8/10"
"TheDanielBaxter","9 August 2023","The plot is so tight, the animation is absolutely insane, I honestly have never seen a more incredible looking movie. On a technical and visual level, this film incorporates literally every style of animation and cinematography that is available. It is jaw dropping what has been achieved in this movie. The characters are brilliant, with perfectly selected voice actors to match.SONY really have achieved something unique here, and the animators should each be given their own award for the level of skill and attention to detail in this film.I have superhero fatigue and am tired of Multiverse plots. But all that goes out of the window, just for this film.A visual masterpiece. True art.","10/10"
"TheDanishMovie-Nerd","12 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' achieves something extraordinary, not only in the realm of animated superhero cinema, but in the broader landscape of film. It transcends boundaries, merging art, narrative, and emotional depth into an awe-inspiring spectacle that stuns in every frame.This movie doesn't merely satisfy, it surpasses expectations and redefines the creative frontier. Sequels rarely surpass the original; examples are few and far between, such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Empire Strikes Back.' However, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' takes its place in this esteemed echelon, a testament to the filmmakers' astonishing creativity.Each scene is a visual marvel; a testament to the tireless dedication of the artists involved. The filmmakers have weaved a vibrant tapestry of eye-catching colors, groundbreaking animation techniques, and arresting visuals that is nothing short of revolutionary. The audacity of its visual language is only paralleled by its storytelling ambitions, placing it alongside the great cinematic masterpieces of our time.The depth and nuance of the characters are another highlight. The voice actors have breathed life into these characters, delivering performances that are both genuine and touching. The film portrays Spider-Man (Miles Morales) with all the complexities and struggles of adolescence, amidst his inter-dimensional escapades. The depiction of his relationships - with family, friends, and even himself - are as authentic as they are affecting.The narrative arc of Miles Morales strikes a chord because of its universal appeal. It is a tale of growing up, finding one's path, and navigating life's trials, albeit through the lens of a multiverse-traveling teenage superhero. Even amidst the extraordinary, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' maintains a grounding in the utterly relatable, a feat that few films accomplish.In a perfect balancing act, the film manages to evoke laughter, tears, and cheers in equal measures. The humor is sharp and clever, the emotional moments are heart-wrenching, and the action sequences are thrillingly heroic.'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is more than a movie - it's an experience that resonates on many levels, and one that raises the bar for future films. It isn't just a great animation or a remarkable superhero movie, it is a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. This is not just the perfect Spider-Man movie, but a perfect movie. Truly, a testament to the transformative power of cinema and a love letter to fans and newcomers alike.","10/10"

"TheFearmakers","1 July 2023","For diehard defenders of the entire INDIANA JONES franchise (not just those who feel that RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stands alone since it was never called INDIANA JONES AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK), they'll throw the titular Ark of the Covenant coming alive with floating spirits whenever the later episodes go too far into the fantasy or, for the last two ventures, science-fiction and/or science-fantasy realm... but had RAIDERS ended up with Indy in Jerusalem B. C. or seated at The Last Supper for THE LAST CRUSADE, well, then...To give one small thing away with DIAL OF DESTINY would blow the entire cover, but basically new helmer James Mangold deliberately makes the Steven Spielberg action-directing-playbook a helluva lot noisier and way more needlessly violent: anyone helping-out the now extremely-aged and initially grouchy Jones will wind up quickly dead, making those random map-scattered characters not matter much beyond moving the bombastic adventure from one point to another -- in itself an important action-packed aspect which is often done decently enough...But the worst fan reviews have gone to the newest sidekick in Indiana's goddaughter played by the extremely tall and cocky Phoebe Waller-Bridge, actually more an attempted female version of the selfishly-driven RAIDERS French archeologist/middleman-heavy, Belloq, wanting fast cash for what's pricelessly meant as a museum artifact...Which is what Harrison Ford is at this point... an artifact... and the movie plays the old gruff sore-boned fella not only too much at times, but the randomly rejuvenated ""I've been doing this stuff all along"" hero doesn't seem very natural while, during various pockets of chase sequence escapades, the plot gets dizzy in a tiresome and complicated balancing act...Following the too-often-separated goals of Jones, the goddaughter Helena (with her own spry child sidekick, basically a sidekick's sidekick), and the central German Nazi, here played by Mads Mikkelsen, donning an omnipresent dull frown despite the usual Indy-villain obsession of obtaining the impossible by any means possible ie shadowing Jones since he always gets there first...Making DIAL ultimately feel more like a high-priced, multi-level video game (in particular the de-aged young Harrison Ford prologue) but that often feels maneuvered by a true franchise fan, trying their best to present a sky's-the-limit finale that ironically only works when it's not trying so hard to be... an INDIANA JONES movie.","8/10"
"theffachrif","10 July 2023","Directed and co-written by James Mangold, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is set in 1969, the film follows Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw trying to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can take it for himself and change the outcome of World War II.If there's a word that I would use to sum up this movie is probably underwhelming. The movie starts with a much-hyped de-aged Harrison Ford fighting off a Nazi on a moving train to Berlin, the de-aging looked pretty good for the most part but it gets obvious and uncomfortable to look at when Indy gets into action. While director James Mangold tried his best to make the action as fun as the last four movies (yeah I enjoyed Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) but he's no Spielberg and it's nowhere near as memorable and impactful. Only the first 20 minutes or so truly felt like an Indiana Jones movie, the rest of it is just off, excessive, and dull at the same time even the score by John Williams couldn't really help it nonetheless, I quite enjoyed it. Seeing Mads Mikkelsen's name as the bad guy gets me excited and all but later disappointed by how they handled his character, so you can't put all the blame on his performance. He even got very little screen time to shine, looks like he appeared only when the time or situation is convenient for him, and he's just there. Thomas Kretschmann as a Nazi Colonel is more menacing, they probably should have just developed him as the villain instead I guess.So this is it right?, the last one for Indiana Jones, ever. Why not make him have an adventure with his actual family in his swan song, they instead write a new character that's basically his annoying goddaughter who always tries to get under his ""hat"" with her own Short Round wannabe. (Spoiler Alert!!) And turned him into a sad, broken old man by killing off his son and on the brink of a divorce. What could be a happier ending for his character than the one we already got in Crystal Skull though, it's a more fitting closure to me.Frankly, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is just another action blockbuster that happens to feature the iconic character who seems not enjoying what he should've in his final outing.6,5/10.","7/10"

"thejefflewis-92228","1 July 2023","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite movie. I did not feel that ""Dial of Destiny"" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. ""Dial of Destiny"" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like ""Dial of Destiny"", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.","6/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","10/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","26 July 2017","First thing off the bat, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' were thoroughly enjoyable films, more so than expected them to be, though they were not quite masterpieces. 'Rise' was exceptionally well made and very entertaining, provoked thought and had heart. 'Dawn' had a bigger and bolder approach and delivered just as much, if not more so, on the brains and heart.So naturally, expectations for 'War for the Planet of the Apes' were quite large. Unfortunately, despite really wanting to like it (have never watched a panned film expecting to hate it or an acclaimed expecting to love it, regardless of the general consensus, always thinking for myself and always try to be respectful and perceptive), 'War for the Planet of the Apes' was a disappointment. It is a long way from a terrible film, and is not deserving of the 1/10 ratings it's garnered (it's a 4 at least), that implies that there are no redeeming qualities at all that coming from a subjective person that is further from the truth, but out of the 2010's rebooted 'Planet of the Apes' trilogy it's the weakest by quite some way.There are a number of things to admire about 'War for the Planet of the Apes'. The best things about it are the production values and the design and characterisation of the apes. Simply put, the production values all round are exceptional. Once again the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and the scenery is strikingly atmospheric. It's the special effects and make-up that deserve the most praise, that the apes look so real and that it is hard to believe they were made with a mix of motion-capture and CGI key frame is once again testament to how good they look. Characterisation for them is every bit as incredible. When they communicate they don't need to say much and it is the most nuanced the film gets, when saying or doing little (as little as a glance or a gesture) it still feels like they're saying a lot.Just as good is the character and performance of Caesar. He has always been a hugely relatable and complex character and is much more compelling than any of the human characters here. One really roots for him, he is impeccably designed and remarkably nuanced in how he moves and communicates and he actually feels like a real character. One cannot talk about the film and not mention Andy Serkis, the man very rarely fails to amaze me and he gives an intensely moving portrayal of Caesar, definitely deserving of award recognition.A few of the action sequences are thrilling with much visceral tension in the best moments. The first 15-20 minutes are remarkably promising and highly suggestive of it being a good film. Although very closely indebted seemingly to Colonel Kurtz from 'Apocalypse Now', Woody Harrelson gives it his all and fares well compared to the rest of the human cast.On the other hand, the human characters are nowhere near as well-written or compelling as the apes. Many are underwritten to the point of banality, underused and some add little to nothing to the story (especially the little girl). Harrelson aside, the acting from the humans isn't so hot either, the little girl is really annoying and very overwrought.The script is also very messy, lacking the intelligent simplicity and nuance of the previous two films, and instead resorting to awkwardness and cheesiness. The story started off promisingly but went down the plug fast. The pacing became incredibly dull and stayed that way for most of the film, seriously struggling to sustain the overlong running time, and is filled with crass and gratuitous graphic violence, cartoonish villainy that has more cheese than threat, a strong lack of emotional core and tension, nothing to drive the story forward and a general lack of cohesion. Things feel very rushed, leaden and confused in the final act.Matt Reeves did a great job directing 'Dawn...'. Here one really questions what happened and whether it really is the same guy. His direction here is overblown and lethargic, things that he very cleverly avoided previously. 'War...' is big on the spectacle and looks mighty impressive, but is one of those big and noisy films that forgets to properly tell a story or do anything with most of the characters. It also feels heavy-handed in its portrayal of fascism and slavery. One gets what the war of the title is referring to, but with only the characterisation of the apes working the tension and conflict just doesn't work.All in all, looks amazing but not the sort of film that makes one think or treat its audience with respect and it is severely lacking in heart and soul. 5/10 Bethany Cox","5/10"

"themarvelheroeslildoop","3 July 2023","The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was. I hated her in this movie.","7/10"
"TheMovieDiorama","9 March 2018","Just when I thought no blockbuster would be worthy of a perfect rating, this beauty comes along and proves me wrong. Oh. My. Word. This was absolutely phenomenal. Flawless in terms of the summer blockbuster season. A damn masterpiece in conveying conflict in both war and within one's self. A defining film that will change motion capture imagery for the future (Avatar may have just lost its crown). An action spectacle that knows how to balance explosions with thought-provoking themes and dialogue. A finale that ends a fantastic trilogy (that really we didn't deserve) and cements it as one of the best trilogies of all time. Another reason to love Andy Serkis even more due to his captivating lead performance and consistent hard work on and off screen. So much grit and realism that you'll be questioning to yourself halfway through: ""...hang on, these are CGI apes right?"" as your mind melts and becomes entranced by the sheer perfection of every piece of fur that's visible to human eye as it blows gently in the snowy winds!! So. Much. Emotion. I teared not once, not twice, but three damn times. It's relentless, the waves of emotion just kept crashing down on me...and yet I didn't want to escape. I've grown attached to these complex emotive characters for three films, every chapter felt like getting to know them. The beauty of it is, that the dialogue is minimal...is all in their eyes! So many scenes where the Apes look directly into the camera...into my soul! The human girl added a much needed symbol to the plot: innocence. The dialogue between Harrelson's ""Colonel"" and Caesar was palpable, a five minute scene just of raw powerful dialogue. Bad Ape was a much required lighthearted character who brings some smiles because this film is relentlessly depressing, I warn you now, your soul will be drained of all emotions. But my God what a journey, no regrets whatsoever. Without a doubt, War for the Planet of the Apes gets the perfect rating.","2/10"
"TheMovieDoctorful","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","1/10"
"TheMovieSnob247","16 February 2013","I've been waiting for a film to really capture my imagination from 2012 and I was beginning to think it wasn't going to happen. Life of Pi finally did that. Stunningly beautiful and inspiring, it's the best movie I've seen from last year. A young man (Pi) and his family are shipwrecked while moving to America with the animals from their family zoo. While he manages to survives the ordeal on a life boat, he must find a way to co-exist with some of the other survivors of the wreck; particularly a Bengal Tiger curiously named Richard Parker. A few minutes into this I knew I was going to love this movie. The opening scenes were beautiful shot and the musical score was joyous and whimsical. I was intrigued from the start and the film kept me that way throughout. There's something about well made movies with animals just I can't resist (yes, I'm a sucker that way). I don't think I've ever watched Two Brothers without being moved to tears. First off all, Ang Lee does a lot with very little on screen out side of the ocean and a boat. You would think there isn't much you can do with a film story like this, but Lee makes it work (his creativity is clearly on display). There are some really beautiful visual effects scenes (especially at night time) and the CG Tiger was beyond belief! I still can't believe that Tiger wasn't real, just outstanding work by the visual effects team that worked on that. I also felt the 3D worked really well for this movie. 3D works when it's used to make the film more immersive (like in Avatar) and not just as a cheap gimmick in order to charge more. The pacing was very good at no point in the over 2 hours did I feel it dragged or lost interest. There was also more than enough to keep you entertained (again, it's hard to do this when limited with what you can do) and plenty of humour was sprinkled throughout. Combining this with the soothing score and great storytelling, this film just seemed to work for me on every level. There are some definite parallels to Cast Away; this seemed unavoidable given the nature of the story. While there were similarities, at no point did I find this film was a cheap imitation or ripped off Cast Away as some would suggest. This film stands on it's own merit and I even felt had a number of powerful scenes that rivalled Robert Zemeckis's classic. It takes great acting to make both these movies work and fortunately that is the case here. Newcomer Suraj Sharma (young Pi) creates a character you can't help but love. And Irfan Khan's (adult Pi) narration is outstanding and pulls everything together. Together they really bring this character to life and are very believable; when the emotional scenes come, they hit home. The ultimate scene of this film for me comes when Richard Parker and Young Pi's journey comes to an end and it's so heartbreaking it had me fighting back tears. Both Suraj and Irfan are completely broken and their performances lift the scene to what I think maybe the most emphatic of 2012. It reminded me of a similar scene in Cast Away that is one of my favorite movie moments ever and gets me every time. There are philosophical and spiritual elements of this film which I found really interesting as well. I tend to hate most movies where you watch most of the film and at the end the film does a complete 180 and says ""Oh, what you watched the last 1.5 hours didn't really happen; *this* is what really happened!"". That gimmick is often used to create shock value and most of the time is a cop out by the director for a bad story. The difference here is that mechanism serves a legitimate purpose in this film. In another moving scene in the film Young Pi tells another version of the story. The author (and Ang Lee via proxy) doesn't treat you as a child and dictate to you what to believe and why. Two stories are presented and it's up to you to believe in whichever you choose. The film makes it clear it's not so much which story you chose to believe, but why you chose it and whether or not you're at peace with that decision. And in making your choice, I think the film forces you learn something about yourself. I confirmed what I've always believed: that I'm hopelessly optimistic. I loved that this film challenged me in this way and it sparked a really interesting conversation on the drive home and among friends later. This for me is always one of the elements of a great movie; the lasting effect of it. What was the film saying? What does the film mean to you personally? How does it make you look at life or circumstances differently? These are all questions I was asking myself in the days after and even now still. And everyone has their own answers and opinions, as they should. And that's kind of the point. While I'm pulling for it to win Best Picture next week, Hollywood politics are always in play. It looks like that's going to either Zero Dark Thirty or Lincoln. Which is really unfortunate, because this is a better overall film than both of those films. I wish this had maybe come out in a weaker year where it would receive the praise it deserves. If this were to match up against say Slumdogg Millionaire or The King's Speech, it would be a no brainer in my opinion.This film blew me away and it's not to be missed. Movies like Life of Pi are why I love going to movies.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob","10/10"
"TheMovonka","4 August 2017","To start short and simple, yes the ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" shows no war at all. The misleading title, trailer and even posters let expectations arise to see the conflict of the second movie intensify and peak in an enduring battle between last human armies and the settled ape fighters to establish their colony for good. Well, you don't get thatAccording to this aspect, I understand a lot of disappointment in the critics, but let me tell you, audience trades in that expectation with an intense emotional experience about the desperate fight for survival of the apes, led by their liberator from hour one, Caesar. This is why in Austria and Germany, this movie is called ""Planet of the Apes: Survival"" and suits much better.You feel with the always on the run colony of apes, as Woody Harrelson hunts down the enemy race of wild animals in his perception in a classically established psychopath Apocalypse Now manner as the Colonel of a separatist human army. As he drifts away to madness, long and slow pacing scenes as well as high class CGI close ups bound viewers with the fear of the chased ones. As the brutality narrows down to single destinies of ape characters, fear changes to will for vengeance and the guerrilla fight for a better future of apes begins.Here the movie establishes the pace and structure of how should inferior technology beat the crazy humans with all their military power. Consequently, as war is brutal, there is no Rambo story to see the good fighting the bad, but a story taking you deeper and deeper into the desperation of being chased and jailed. Suddenly Caesar and his tribe find themselves captured and enslaved in a concentration camp, mixing the movie temporary with Schindlers List and Unbroken moments. But as apes are strong together, the fight for survival continues for a better future, for which Caesar would sacrifice everything, even his principles.But let's be honest, there are obvious issues with the plot. From the very slow speed to allow strong bindings with ape characters and a good side of the human race, embodied by a lost lonely girl who shows a solid performance to enrich empathy, the movie takes a long road until the big dramatic final. Slow motion and long dialogues dominate over swift fight scenes like in part two. As this is subjective to like it or not, still some problem occur in the script. Entering a front door, when you follow as guerrilla troop is linked to high risk of loss. Even without military education the apes could know better how to avoid being seen. On the other hand, entering a concentration camp, leaving it or hundreds of apes disappearing out of a cage is not recognized by any guard who should be trained? I don't think so And yes, the final has its peak as a second human army is just deleted by a coincidentally useful avalanche. That was an easy script move to shorten the end in favor of the apes. But well, to be honest, history is written with such coincidence, and even if it looks ridiculous, would anybody have thought the Spanish armada is beaten by British thanks to storms and winds or did anybody complain about that in Dunkirk the German troops stopped to march on? Still it happened like that, so you just can accept the ""history of the planet of the apes"" by the creators of that movie even if there would have been more elegant ways of pursue that development of the story.Fighting against those harsh critics, giving 1 out of 10 stars, just because of the stated issue points is absolutely absurd. Still the movie is well paced, breathtakingly executed and well-acted. Not meeting the strong expectations of certain viewers does not make it a bad movie I would say. But please go and decide for yourself. You are now well prepared to enjoy or avoid the big final of the Planet of the Apes Trilogy.","4/10"
"TheMysteriousReviewer","14 August 2023","I will be honest, it will be debatable to pick either this or Into The Spider-Verse that's the better. But either way, it truly blew me away. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is not just among the best Spider-Man movie, but also one of the best animated superhero movie ever created next to The Incredibles. It has exceeded to the expectations people wanted with an exciting story that takes the Spider-Verse to a whole new level, top notch animation, unforgettable characters that has given more personalities to get us to know old and new, intense action, and one of the most shocking cliffhangers since The Empire Strikes Back. To fans of the first film, Spider-Man fans, superhero fans, and even fans of movies, this is the movie I think you are truly gonna enjoy. I really encourage to check it out. After watching this myself, this already got me excited for Beyond The Spider-Verse and hopefully it will give us a perfect ending to all this. I have no idea when that movie is going to come out. But when it does, let's go over this one more time.","10/10"
"TheNabOwnzz","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the cliché fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","10/10"
"TheNamelessCzar","1 July 2023","I've never been a huge fan of the Indiana Jones movies, but my kids were excited to see this and given the legacy of the franchise I thought I needed to see the final film in the theater. The action sequences are exciting as long as one doesn't put too much thought to them because otherwise, the movie completely falls apart. So many things happen that force you to disavow all common sense and logic, it becomes laughable at times. The first half was a little boring, and the second half was a little silly.

The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees.

It was the title of the film that kept people away. Personally, I didn't watch this in theaters because I thought it was going to be just like the last apes film- which felt like a ""war"" film. Not saying the second apes film wasn't great but we were lead to believe to was going to be the same exact film - which would have been a put off if that was the case. But much to my delight this was an epic odyssey of a film that did not disappoint and helped to put this trilogy as one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.

"thePopcornExplorer","24 June 2023","I think as audiences we know how hard it is for sequels to meet our expectations when the first installment of a saga was already an outstanding piece of art, it feels so good when sequels keep those standards...The sequel of the Spider-Verse gets almost everything right, it manages to bring you back to the insanely original multiverse storyline that was introduced to us on the first film, yet it manages to not fall into the trap of being a repetitive storyline with the same elements.I can't even properly comment the animation work, there are no words to describe how amazing it is, the detail that each universe depicted seems to have its own kind of animation is insane and it continues to be without a doubt the only Marvel / DC movie to make a proper homage to comic books, the original super hero format.It keeps the frenetic energy that the first got us used to, something is always happening and it's interesting to keep following, elements of the first story are brought to continue the protagonists journey and it's an organic narrative, doesn't feel like a forced story line for the sake of a sequel, it makes sense.All universes are beautifully animated, the soundtrack gives you ton of energy, everywhere in the movie you see marvelous imagery, a true piece of art.Adding the this the voice acting is also on point, it's an animated movie and it feels that it is leading the way on how animation should be used specially on the super hero / comic book adaptation world.Filled with dramatic and eye tearing moments and of course with themes that are transversal to probably every person either parent or child and that most of us can probably relate, gives soul to an already beautiful film.

Wow!Sometimes, as a producer, you should finish the product, then watch it and decide not to release it out of self respect.Even The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull couldn't ruin the legacy for me but Phoebe Waller Bridge managed to do it in 5 minutes.A young Harrison Ford CGI dubbed by the actual one was just tragic.","6/10"

"TheRealPetraeus","3 June 2023","An unparalleled feat in the animation genre and cinema as a whole. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece and everything a Spider-Man fan would want. Truly a masterclass in juggling plentiful references, amazing character moments, an interesting and well thought-out story, mesmerizing action sequences, and an incredibly memorable soundtrack. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse handles all of this, along with the best animation that has graced the film industry. The different styles of each world and character mesh with each other so smoothly, it leads to every frame being pure eye-candy.While the breakneck pacing, frantic action sequences, and immensely colorful animation can lead to some viewers feeling overwhelmed (me included), those same viewers will find themselves ready to roll into the sequel once the credits start to roll. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse uses animation to convey so much emotion, which is incredibly difficult to do in the live-action medium. Even though this movie is still a kids movie, the story becomes so much darker and more emotional than I expected. Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse was much more mature than your average kids movie, but this is able to crank the maturity up a notch, but still maintains a fun atmosphere.The comedy is also genuinely great, and manages to be leagues funnier than your average comedy show such as Family Guy . The banter and dialogue between the characters is so natural and well-written that the slowest parts of the movie are still incredibly entertaining. Each bit of long running dialogue has so many hints and jokes throughout, that the chance of your brain processing all of them in a single watch is unlikely. This also applies to the bountiful amount of references in the background of so many different shots. The soundtrack is also just perfect, and is filled with very memorable tracks.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is just perfection. Is it better than its predecessor? No doubt, and that's coming from someone who believes Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is perfect. Yes, they somehow made a movie better than literal perfection. I can't wait for the conclusion to these two cinematic masterpieces and I have no doubt that they will stick the landing. There is so much to love in this movie, that I doubt I could cover everything in a single review. I believe Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has solidified itself as the best Spider-Man film, the best superhero film, and quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made.","10/10"
"theredsky","17 June 2023","I'm kind of getting tired of the MCU's constant stream of quantity over quality and this film is just another example of that problem slowly getting worse and worse. It's probably the most visually interesting of the trilogy only because it has more colors than the first two films combined. He actual visuals and cinematography aren't great though. Everything here feels very unmotivated and bland. It doesn't feel like there is a purpose to any of the shots and they are just going through a checklist of basic shots to get for the scene without feeling creative or interesting. The visuals effects range from okay to just bad. Clearly they didn't spend enough time on them and it really shows here because almost every shot has a lot of visual effects work done on them. There is no sense of size or space in these shots especially towards the end where Cassie Lang is over 10 times the size of MODOK but you really couldn't tell if you just watched the clip and not the whole scene. The story is kind of interesting? They definitely had a really solid first draft that just needed a little more work done but instead of doing that, they just took that first draft and ran with it so a lot of ideas and concepts feel underdeveloped and uninteresting. This could have been solved with a rewrite or two but clearly Feige and them don't care about actually doing that work. Most of the performances are good. Paul Rudd is still doing a great job and Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas are good as well. Jonathan Majors did a great job as well but with everything that came out after this film came out, the less said the better. Shame that he screwed up his career just as he was taking off. Bill Murray was kind of awful though here but thankfully his scene is short. Kang as the villain was the best part of the film. He was fun and engaging and his plan was interesting but his final scene is awful. For an all powerful being, he goes out really poorly. The humor is all over the place. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's unbearably unfunny. There really isn't a whole lot here to like but it's mostly just boring and not bad like Thor 4 and Black Widow. You can honestly probably skip this one unless you really wanna see Kang.","1/10"
"ThereelscoopwithKK","12 July 2023","Overall the movie stayed true enough to its roots and it's still acceptable in the Indy series but just barely.Pros:hits the Indiana Jones cues with some nice Easter eggsevokes some nostalgiaopening sequence feels very Indiana Jones like.still an adventureSalah returnsCons:overly long run time, poor camera angles on the action sequencesincredibly large plot holes. More than ever the villain just seems to always know where they're going and arrives at the perfect time.the acting is quite poor and wooden.the script has weird jokes that don't really hit.new things about the Dial of Destiny are just made up on the fly, you still don't know exactly how it works by the end.the face editing on Indiana Jones in the opening sequence doesn't match the voice.","6/10"
"ThereelscoopwithKK","21 February 2023","From someone who enjoyed Thor Love and Thunder while others detested it this movie took it to a whole new level of awful for me. I enjoyed the first 2 Ant Man movies. There was something comforting to the humble Paul Rudd playing Ant man. The characters all fit in perfectly with a simple story. Nothing spectacular, but simple , comedic, and worthwhile.This one on the other hand totally sacrificed Ant Man's character to serve as exposition and did a poor job with that. The characters themselves all felt like different people. Hank Pym feels uninspired , Hope goes along for the ride, and Ant Man is the opposite of his old humble persona which I loved before. His character served as some relief in the past for the other bombastic Marvel personalities. The casting of Cassie doesn't quite fit well with me either.This movie felt like a combination of the worst parts of Spy Kids 3D, Star Wars , and Sharkboy and Lava girl. There was a lot of opportunity to do much more with the quantum realm and this just felt like no effort was put into it. The sets themselves look like they were made in an early 2000s movie. At one point someone in the theaters chair broke and instead of laughing at the movie the audience got amusement out of that.For all the build up nothing ever quite adds up in the story. The one saving grace is that Jonathan Majors is a high quality actor. Even with his skill set they still nearly ruined him with a full and uninspiring script. I came into this so excited after how they concluded Loki season 1, but what a let down.They are going to need another stellar Loki season to try to get this phase back on track. I hope they don't spoil Guardians for me as well with their final send off not long from now.","1/10"

"theroo200182","26 April 2019","I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.","8/10"
"TheSeaLion","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","10/10"

"TheSupertramp","23 November 2012","Ang Lee takes Yann Martel's much acclaimed novel and turns it into a collage full of masterful imagery and dream-like visuals, which remains at the core a profoundly simple tale of spirituality, in a manner which might leave you either with a wry smile and shake of head at what you just experienced or with a euphoric feeling equivalent to the one you get after seeing a magic trick. The thing with this magic however, is that it won't leave you for quite a long while and it might even make you question your most core beliefs. Or the lack of them.I don't believe in God but I do believe in the power of stories, imagery, art in it's most simple yet beautiful form and most of all in the power of words. I believe in the power of cinema, the moving images that can move you in more ways than you can imagine. That can transport you into another space and time, into a World full of possibilities. Of everything. Of nothing.And come to think of it believing in God may not be that much different.'Life Of Pi' is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement in terms of visual effects and images but it's real beauty lies in the story that is so simple in it's depiction yet so profound in it's impact.There are scenes of such wonderful amazement that words fall short often. Right from the beginning credits to the poignant scene when Pi leaves his lifeboat just after the ship-wreck and watches the mammoth ship sink underwater, the heart-pounding introduction of Richard Parker on the lifeboat, the surreal dream sequence of Pi, the many sunsets and nights at sea, the mesmerizing scene with the jellyfishes and blue whale and just so many other scenes that each one can be paused and made into a collection of brilliantly picturesque wallpapers. Such brilliant cinematic quality is very rare and it needs to be experienced on the hugest screen possible. It's why we go to the movies for. Ang Lee's direction is minimalistic and focused. Gentle and caressing. He does not make movies. He nurtures a baby and lets him out to play with us when he deems fit.The end is somewhat abrupt in it's flow but nevertheless compelling in it's effect. Suraj Sharma as Pi is very good. Tabu impresses in her short role and Aadil Hussain is effective. But like it's always in almost every movie that he does, it's the brilliant Irrfan Khan who etches out the older Pi with an absolutely touching performance. 'Life Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a shining crown jewel in this oceanic, gigantic world of cinema. Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't happen very often.""I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?"" ""The one with the Tiger."" ""And so it is with God.""I'm a believer. In something not very different from God I think.And yes, always ""the one with the Tiger.""","8/10"

"TheVictoriousV","24 January 2019","""Human get sick. Ape get smart. Human kill ape."" That is where the final story begins. Matt Reeves' War for the Planet of the Apes starts at a point where any hope of peace between the dwindling human race and the increasingly intelligent apes has vanished. It has been hailed as a modern masterpiece and while I will not go that far in my verdict, I can see why viewers would find that this one stands out amongst the usual summer movies.The leader of the apes is Caesar, once again portrayed via state-of-the-art motion-capture by Andy Serkis, and the force of humans they are primarily up against is led by a figure known simply as The Colonel (Woody Harrelson, fantastic as usual). After this ruthless officer invades the jungle-based safe haven of Caesar's followers, killing his wife and child in the process, Caesar elects to seek him out while the other apes search for another sanctuary, rumored to lie beyond the wastelands, where the humans never travel.He is joined by such fellow apes as the wise Maurice (Karin Konoval) and later a human child nick-named ""Nova"" (Amiah Miller) who has mysteriously lost the ability to speak. I was expecting to see more Internet-based complaints with regards to how the most important female character in the film doesn't say anything, but I suppose it's less obvious when the only characters with bigger roles are non-human. Also, I imagine the recent Doctor Who announcement has given the opinion-having web crusaders other things to think about.I must say, though, that the decision of showing this film exclusively from the point-of-view of the apes was the right one, especially considering the walking clichés that all the non-Oldman human beings were back in Dawn (I needn't remind anyone of Mr. ""I'm The A-hole"", capital T intentional). Also interesting is the fact that not all of the chimps, gorillas, and orangutans have mastered speech yet and are thus forced to communicate via gestures, if at all.I was surprised at how much of the film was conveyed either via sign language or in complete silence, noting that this sort of patience is not normally expected from the audience of a summer blockbuster. There were some moments where we got subtitles even though the characters didn't seem to do much of anything with their hands, and at some points Caesar would respond verbally to sign language occurring outside of his peripheral vision, but I admired the minimalism all the same.Another thing that has always set the Apes trilogy apart from most modern garden-variety blockbusters is the characterizations. I maintain that Caesar the Ape is probably one of the most intriguing and complex characters of recent mainstream cinema, thanks both to the writing and Andy Serkis; even at his most vengeful, we understand his wrath because we have seen his suffering (plus, it may be part of his increasingly human mind), and we can believe his status as a respected leader to his ""people"" because we know his courage and sacrifices.The next thing is, as you won't be shocked to learn, the outright astonishing effects, which have only gotten better and better with each film. And it isn't just in terms of the flawlessly natural movements of the animals or the way their bodies interact with the environments. As my dad confirmed after a local screening, they've also improved the lighting issues of the last chapter and opted for physically based rendering instead of ""tweaking"" everything until you can see all the little details of the textures, even in scenes where it wouldn't match the rest of the lighting. In War it looks bafflingly good and it is never once blatantly obvious where the CGI ends and the physically real objects begin.Sure there are some stupidly plot convenient moments, instances of questionable geography (I don't know where in America this takes place that the characters can travel from a desert to a snowy pine forest within a seemingly short time), one downright jarring product placement, and a few remaining character clichés such as the ""Five Man Band"" Caesar puts together once he vows to hunt down The Colonel, complete with a ""Sixth Ranger"" in the form of a cowardly chimpanzee called ""Bad Ape"" (Steve Zahn). There was also a point near the end where the human side began to seem a little too overtly evil and I detected some not too subtle allusions to Trump's ""Adolf-ian America"" wherein the fascist humans are constructing a wall at the expense of the apes and there comes a time where we must ask ourselves who the REAL Mexicans are.Luckily, they saved it somewhat during a conversation scene between Caesar and The Colonel, where we more clearly understand why The Colonel does as he does and how he fears a sort of ""great replacement"", as I've elected to call it to make it even more topical. War for the Planet of the Apes is still an inordinately complex and thoughtful action film (especially for one that happens to star Simians with machine guns) which also boasts top-class visual effects, a powerful score by Michael Giacchino, great photography throughout the whole show, characters as memorable as they are intriguing, peak performances, and a few interesting references to the original Planet of the Apes that make me hope this is not just the end of the reboot trilogy, but of the whole franchise.When Caesar fell to his knees outside The Colonel's fortress as though he were about to shout ""you maniacs"", I felt that the circle was complete.","1/10"
"thinker1691","18 September 2013","Director Ang Lee teamed up with writer Yann Martel to craft this imaginative tale for the silver screen. It relates the story of a young Indian boy named Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) growing up in India with a caring family and an acute sense of curiosity. Pressed by a sense of wonder and an insatiable drive to understand life, Pi and his family undergo a long and dangerous sea voyage aboard a Japanese cargo vessel. Encountering a huge storm and a shipwreck, Pi soon finds himself alone in a lifeboat with the remnants of what used to be a Zoo. The struggle to survive in a boat is arduous enough, but to maintain himself and a hungry Begal Tiger is doubly difficult. Still, the adventure taken by Pi to strange places unknown, prompts questions which lie between reality and mystical illusion. In addition the fantastic movie invites the audience to experience the incredible and harrowing ordeal with him. The result is a film not easily forgotten especially with the help of international stars like Gerard Depardieu. Easily recommended to all. ****","10/10"
"thinkMovies","3 September 2023","The first 21 minutes is a video game about WWII Nazis hauling archeological treasure for the Fuhrer. They were hoping for the lance that drew Jesus' blood on the cross, but they got a fake instead of the real one, yet, they had no idea that another of the artifacts in their possession could find holes in time and do the time travel thing. It's the Antikythera mechanism! An AI de-aged-for-1945 Indy keeps the breakneck pace of the video game going.The next 25 minutes are also a video game gone awry, that's trying to bring the funny, but Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins would find nothing funny in this mess.The minutes roll on relentlessly and, now, we are chasing the Antikythera mechanism. The real one was discovered in 1901-2 in a Roman shipwreck 130 feet underwater near the island of Antikythera estimated at approximately 70-130 Before Common Era, and all of it was found in one lump -and nobody knows when it was constructed or by whom. The movie artifact is supposed to be a perfectly preserved half part of the mechanism, constructed by ancient mathematician Archimedes in 260 BCE, discovered in 1905 at 130 and at 260 feet, with the Indy-travel-map showing our heroes searching off Athens instead of at the real discovery location... Indy must find the other half of the machine but a Nazi wants to travel back to 1939, change history and have Nazi Germany win WWII. Indy has a Greek diver friend with a boat off Athens but his friend with a boat off Athens turns out to be Spanish. And, the Aegean Sea is referred to as an ocean.They find the thing in an underwater cave full of eels instead of the usual snakes, fly through time in a Nazi plane, land in 260 BCE instead of 1939 CE, they meet Archimedes during a Roman siege of Syracuse speak perfect modern Greek to him, he responds in perfect modern Greek, Indy wants to stay but his goddaughter punches him unconscious and flies him back to Manhattan, circa 1969 where Marion stops the divorce proceedings and brings the groceries.Are there any questions as to why Steven did not direct this one?I was 23 when I saw Raiders. I'm 65 now. If I live another 23 years to 88 it will be a nice book ends for a life lived with Indy.

"thomasbungay-80306","28 June 2023","Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a great conclusion to the franchise. The director, James Mangold does a similar job to what he did with 'Logan' and does a fantastic job concluding an old man Indy on his final adventure. Surprisingly, Phoebe Waller Bridge was a highlight of this movie and a great inclusion along with Ethan Isidore who plays 'Teddy' a young character much like Short Round. They keep the franchises tung and cheek comedy going throughout and Mads Mikkelson does a great job as the antagonist. The story is actually really solid with the time travel element keeping you on you're toes throughout. Harrison Ford obviously is fantastic once again as Indiana Jones and does a great job performing an older and more run down interpretation of our favourite archaeologist. As an action and adventure movie on its own it's consistent and fun throughout however you can't help but feel it's missing a little bit of that Indy charm that Steven Spielberg brought to the franchise. Of course it's not as good as any of the original three films, but other than that, it's a really enjoyable film and a great end to one of my favourite movie franchises of all time!","7/10"

"ThomasDrufke","14 July 2017","It definitely couldn't have been predicted after Tim Burton botched his 2001 remake, but this particular reboot/re-imagining of the Planet of the Apes series proved to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time. The fact that they managed to make a film that forces an audience to root for the apes over humans is an accomplishment on its own. Caesar's arc through 3 films is one of the most unique and emotionally powerful things that any franchise has given us.Let's start out with the most obvious thing to like about War for the Planet of the Apes, the visuals. In just 6 short years, the CGI/performance capture effects have gone from being impressive to astronomically important. There are recent films that still don't hold up to the precedent set by 'Dawn' a few years ago, and I'm sure it will be years before we see anything close to what Matt Reeves and company did with 'War'. It's also worth mentioning how expanded this cast of characters is to the last film. It's not just Caesar & Koba anymore. We got a deeper look into Maurice, who has always been a favorite of mine in the past few films. Caesar's family grew, hence giving us more apes to care for. And a few new apes that I won't talk about to avoid spoilers. All of them have their own personality and look to them, which makes the visual feats even more impressive.Woody Harrelson came on board to the series as 'The Colonel', a typically bada** character name for Harrelson. Of course, it's no surprise that he stepped up to the challenge of taking on the villain role, after Gary Oldman did a wonderful job the last time around. Much like Oldman's character, the great thing about The Colonel is that he's more than just an intimidating face. As much as this is a 'war' for the planet in a literal way, it may be even more so a 'war' emotionally between Caesar and The Colonel. As expected, Reeves does a great job of balancing out the physical and emotional conflict to incredible results. Actually, because of this, the film ends up going a much more unexpected route than I imagined.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the imagery. This won't be the first review to commend how well Reeves manages to portray Caesar, but I love the way in which he's essentially made into a mythological figure. A figure that will clearly inspire them for generations and all the way up until the original timeline started in 1967's Planet of the Apes. There's nothing more terrifying for a human in this film to see hundreds and maybe even thousands of apes become inspired to revolt because of Caesar. But not just on Caesar's end, the imagery spans every character and every big moment. Nothing was broken up by untimely humor (though there was some surprisingly funny moments) and there weren't any unwarranted or unearned emotional triumphs and losses. This series took its time with storytelling, and it showed.My only real complaint would be that there's a particular group of people that get talked about quite a bit but don't ever receive the proper screen time to warrant them being considered integral to the film. But that's more of a just a comment on how MacGuffin's usually work in films and how it can be frustrating. In all, it's hard to imagine a better conclusion to the Apes trilogy.

"three_dead_crows","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","1/10"

"ThunderKing6","6 March 2023","It wasn't as bad as people said. It was a decent film. Still Thor Love and Thunder is still goatedThis review was made on March 6 23About: The Ant family gets shrunk into the quantum realm. Jane has secrets. The conquer is revealed and Scott must make decisions to save the ant family.Story and production: The story was basicly simple. Find their way out and meet the conquer. It needed a bit more flavour. I almost fell a sleep when Scott meets Kang bits.Kang was good though. He's I mean they are going to be the villain I mean villians of the century.Scott and Janet were the only ones with some development. Everyone else was either just there or annoying/looked weird man . *cough* Cassie.When she said the D word to Modok it was so cringe funny.Overall the production and story went well. Way better than reviews stated.Highlight: I liked the possibility scene. Very creative.Quaz was good too. His queen reminded me of Rita. I liked her too. Kang too was iCONIC. Skrull Kang.Goofs: Cassie looked weird. I'm not sure why it was called Antman and Wasp. Wasp was very minor. She had no story.What can be learned? Secrets and Time are a dynamic duo.Should you watch this?: I say yes. Ignore the reviews and box office. Avatar 2 and 1 made a billion but those moves were not good. Antman 3 sets up a couple new events.","6/10"
"thunt","14 March 2023","I watched the Ant Man quadro mania in IMAX 3d At the nearby alley on teh theaters. The IMAX 3d was impressive the characters did seem as though they were separated from the backgrounds standing out in three dimensions for at least the first 15 minutes of the movie until your eyes adjust and you forget about it. The film mainly shot in the quantum realm of blues and purples gives an amazing otherworldly feeling to the picture. Although I feel that it lacks some of the humor of earlier Hitman films, as it rarely is in San Francisco, and does not feature at man's crew of foolish criminal robbers, who are excellent supporting characters. Much missed in this film. The plot pretty much a direct ripoff of Star Wars, does not impress and even gets slightly laughable at times with the female character, his daughter declaring how great she is, and then starting off the entire crisis because of her greatness. Hubris perhaps. Still, I feel it was an excellent introduction of Kang the Conqueror into the MCU and that it will set up the other movies as they intended it to. Many have complained about the special effects but as a novice, I didn't see any major glaring mistakes or holes. I'm sure they're there. But as a movie goer and enjoyer of movies, it was delightful entertaining, comic book fair. Can't beat it.YouTranscribed by Otter.","6/10"

"timeblank","21 January 2024","I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!","9/10"
"timeblank","8 June 2023","I felt a bit lost watching this fast-paced movie with great animation, as some of the odd animation made me dizzy. The first half mainly focuses on Gwen and her encounter with Spider-man 2099. Although I may have missed the tragedy in her universe, the movie expands the Spiderverse and introduces The Spot as a new villain, shedding new light on Miles Morales as the new Spider-man. The scene to keep an eye out for is when Miles is bitten by the spider, leading to a shocking conclusion that will permanently alter him. Overall, this film is a continuation, and I'm excited for the next installment.","10/10"
"TimelessFlight","5 June 2023","Life of Pi is a wonderful film; creative, troubling, moving and stunningly beautiful.It tells the highly unusual story of 'Pi' - a young boy - who is stranded at sea on a small boat after the ship on which he was a passenger sinks during a violent storm. He is not alone - sharing the tiny boat with him are a handful of animals, including a Bengal Tiger who he calls Richard Parker. They too were aboard the ship (part of a zoo being transported) and made it to the lifeboat with Pi.If this seems a rather fanciful plot, don't let it put you off. By the time you get to this part of the story you'll be well immersed in this fabulous film, and indeed such is the exceptional skill of the film makers that you'll feel well and truly onboard the boat with them.The animals are of course cgi creations, but so brilliantly done that it doesn't seem that way. The journey that unfolds takes us through moments of danger, despair, hallucination, survival and tenderness. It is utterly gripping and leads us to an understated ending that invites us to question just who or what was on that little boat.A highly distinctive, visually original and emotionally compelling film that I can highly recommend.","9/10"
"tink-28108","29 June 2023","I loved it. From start to finish and the music. It's art really. It had really cool twists that I did not see coming (and I'm usually really good at calling those). It also has some great cameos and Easter eggs in it that I was excited to see. It does say ass quite a bit. Probably at least 3 or 4 times but that's it. We took our school so it was hard to hear it over the kids. Meaning the cuss words are well placed. As a mom, the speech that Mile's mom gave had me tearing up. I also think it's something that my three year old would enjoy. So it's definitely family friendly (unless you're super strict about cuss words.)","10/10"

Leave it to POW Indy to break out and foil Mads Mikkelsen's evil plan. Even with the anti-aging CG effects, I'm stoked!

"TK32","28 April 2018","I love all the Marvel movies - well, until now. It doesn't seem that the movie ends so much as two-thirds of the way in the writers got bored and said ""let's just phone in a bunch of failures and quit. Note: bad guy winning doesn't automatically make dramatic tension. And you can't just write the characters acting stupid to make them lose. If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing ""even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest. AnAndd what about a simple ""The battle continues in..."" All in all, skip this one and wait for the next.","3/10"

Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care? Thanos is the Bad Guy, so defeat him and move on! Then the Ending --- utterly pathetic!","3/10"

It´s one big LET DOWN :(Again it´s a good movie, but great.... no way.

"tmaria1","3 December 2017","As much as I liked this trilogy and this movie I really wish they would lean more towards getting us closer in time to the original 1968 version. I understand these are prequels but if they are going to continue with these then I suggest fast forwarding a thousand years or more to just before when Heston arrives in the original 1968 classic. War was a good movie. I truly liked everything about it. I see the humans turning mute setting us up for the future. What I really want to see next is what caused the future nuclear holocaust? Show me what went on in the forbidden zone prior to Heston and crew arriving. Show us how the mutants from Beneath the Planet of the Apes came to be. If the ending of this movie was a foreshadowing of the lake that Heston crash lands in then we are going to have a problem. Remember he landed outside of New York City not over the mountains near California. Perhaps another trilogy can tie up these loose ends.","9/10"

The movie is exactly what you expect it to be, nothing more nothing less. It seemed liked the writers & director knew how absurd the plot was and embraced it well. If you looking for a straight action movie with some badass scenes then you will like this movie. Not to mention Josh Hutchinson did a great job playing a character which seemed to be almost identically based of the current President's son.","6/10"
"tmservo","17 November 2012","We were able to see this at an early screening but per that paper, not to say anything until after other screenings. So, now it's screened elsewhere I can pitch in my thoughts.Life of Pi is a film that absolutely surprised me. I had not read the book, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I knew that a film from Ang Lee would be exceptionally well done, and I wasn't wrong. This is an incredibly strong work, on par with ""Crouching Tiger"" .. Not through action or events but in the way the cinematography, camera movements and beautiful settings help draw a viewer in and really sell the story.The Life of Pi is so well crafted that it moves effortlessly between a story of youth to a story of adulthood. If you have not read the book, the ending is the kind of twist that while completely understandable redefines your entire film experience in a way I hadn't been a part of since ""The Sixth Sense"". You immediately think back over the entirety of the film and see it in a drastically different way and it works.No matter the perspective you chose, this is an amazingly well acted, well directed film that goes into my list of some of the best films I've seen this year.I watched in 3D, but this is a film full of so many bright colors and scenes that I will seek out a chance to see it in 2D just for the beauty of the scenes. Strongly recommended.","1/10"
"tokoroos","25 June 2023","I want to have this movie in my home, right now. So I can watch it a few more times. As I watched in the cinema, I got emotional of how beautiful this movie is. Everytime Gwen's storyline came up, I got goosebumps. The backgrounds fits every character perfectly. It's freaking funny, it's good for nerds and non-nerds, there's a lot of depth and emotion in it. Various life stages are touched in this movie. From teenager to parent. From puppy love to hardcore grief.When the movie ended the audience sighed. Nooo we want moooore. And I will wait patiently for more of this beautiful artpiece. If the third one is half as good as this one, it's still the best series in the history of film.","10/10"
"tomasmug","2 June 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible. I strongly recommend watching it in a theatre - I don't believe you'll get the full experience on your home screen/laptop/etc. Might I recommend you see it in IMAX if you can.The Spiderverse animated saga is going to be remembered as one of the defining film series of this generation.This is the Empire Strikes Back, the Dark Knight of this generation.I know comparisons aren't particularly helpful to anyone, but I can't think of a better way to describe this film. It is absolutely fantastic in every way a I would say even more so than its predecessor, which was already a 10/10 film. Visually dazzling, hilarious, tense, dramatic - Across the Spider-verse has it all.","10/10"
"tommy-97761","22 April 2023","Do you recall the Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser from 2008? I got a similar feeling watching this. Though the CGI had somewhat improved in the past 15 years, you still don´t give a damn about much that is happening onscreen because it is very obviously fake and shot on a green screen. While the Journey was fun in a guilty pleasure kind of way, this movie just puts you to sleep. I am so glad that I skipped it in the theater. If this is the way marvel movies are heading now, I will skip any future releases as well. Thor Love an Thunder looked horrible, this does as well. The only redeeming quality was Kang, who managed to wake me up in the second half of the movie, though I've heard rumors that due to some allegations Disney and other studios might want to be disassociated with Jonathan Majors for the future. There was little chemistry between the actors, the jokes are flat, the movie looks painfully fake and the third act fight with faceless soldiers against no-name troops is anticlimactic. Why even bother with this movie? Why even bother with Marvel past Endgame? So far, none of the post-endgame movies had really justified their existence. They are hardly worth a cinema ticket anymore.","7/10"
"tommy5677","29 September 2018","That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers. And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. 
In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","10/10"
"TomTalksFilms","28 June 2023","It's been 15 years since the last entry in this much loved franchise (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) was released and after the (putting it very kindly) mixed reception that film received you may have thought that would be the last time we would see Harrison Ford put on the fedora. You'd be wrong though as once Disney get their hands on a property they love to squeeze every penny out of it until it's run right into the ground. I'm sure Disney execs would argue you that this film gives the franchise another chance to end on a high, so the question is does it?Honestly?Not exactlyThe main plot of this film is centred around unsurprisingly The Dial of Destiny or it's proper name as it's referred to in the film the Antikythera (copied it from Google because I can't spell that). The Dial is an artefact that was created by Archimedes and is said to possess the power to let its owner travel through fissures in time (I had one of those on my a** once, it was painful 😬). This results in The Dial being sort after by three main people, Indy himself, A Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) and a student called Helena (Phoebe Waller- Bridge) who all have different intentions for what to do with it. From there the usual Indiana Jones action adventure ensues and firstly I have to say, it's at least better than the Crystal Skull which depending on who you talk to might mean very little.Firstly the positives, the main thing I felt this film did well being that it's confirmed to be the final Indiana Jones film is that it wraps up a lot of the loose ends, in particular it answered a lot of the questions I had after watching The Crystal Skull, so in a list of things you want in a concluding film of a franchise it gets a big tick in that box. Also, seeing Harrison Ford on the big screen is always an absolute joy, he's such an icon and just like all his roles he gives 100% percent in this one.I also felt John Williams score really stood out in this one, another cinema icon and you can't help but smile when a John Williams score plays and it brings back the memories of watching all those classic films for the first time. I also felt that overall as a film in itself it was an enjoyable big screen experience, certainly better than a large number of the films that have come out this year so far.Now for the not so great, most notably that while it's an enjoyable film on its own, other than the score it fails to capture the magic of the original trilogy. It's ultimately just not that memorable and I think that largely comes down to how great the original trilogy is and how great Steven Spielberg is a director, it's really difficult to replicate that kind of cinema magic again with a new director hence why I think the franchise should have stayed as a trilogy.I also felt the trailer which is everywhere and hard to avoid shows you too much of the film, there are even some cameos in the trailer which I would rather have been left as a nice surprise for when I saw the film. In fact most of the first half of the film is in the trailer, it's only really the last 30 mins that comes as any sort of surprise.This film ultimately isn't a bad film in itself but it fails to capture the magic of the original Indiana Jones trilogy and I don't think it's one I'll find myself revisiting all that often.","8/10"
"TomTomH","13 January 2013","Ang Lee's 3D VFX film adaptation of Yann Martel's 2001 award-winning book of the same name, ""Life of Pi"", is such an amazing film with stunning artwork. Sitting in the cinema last night with friends, it was quite a jaw-dropping experience. I've got to say this would be impossible to do with real animals. Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, if he was real, not CGI, would have not been easy on set. The way they animate the tiger and background is incredible. Whenever I saw a clean shot of the boat (that Pi and Parker sail in) and the sinking ship, it reminds me of the look of the animation they do in Spielberg's Tintin.Pi's life is told in three stages: childhood, teenage life and adult. The adult stage is quite emotional. The story is delivered by adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) retelling the story about his unbelievable past life to a writer (Rafe Spall, Prometheus). Pi's childhood (portrayed by Gautam Belur, age 5 and Ayush Tandun, age 13) starts with him being bullied at school because of his unusual name, which then he shortens, but still causes teasing. He soon begins to become interested with different religions which causes some amusement. His father owns a zoo and he teaches Pi how to take care of the animals. These lessons Pi's been taught helps him later on in his life. The teenage Pi's life (portrayed by Suraj Sharma) begins his perilous journey when sailing on a ship moving to Canada, when his family agree to move from India. On the way, Pi and the ship encounter a heavy storm which ends up sinking the ship and him ending up on a lifeboat, becoming the only (human) survivor. While lost at sea with no hope, he discovers that a tiger (Richard Parker) has come aboard. Although he knows the tiger wants to kill him, he eventually works out a way to control him. Thinking about Parker, he reminds me a little bit of Aslan from C.S. Lewis' Narnia series; when he walks and roars and uses tiger facial expressions, but not when he attacks. He's a lot fiercer than Aslan, who is more calm and friendly.For Suraj Sharma (teenage Pi), this is his first ever acting debut in film and already he's received his very first Bafta nomination for the Orange Rising Star Award category (and that's what I think he deserves). He brings a touching and rewarding performance as Pi, I think he's the perfect choice for the role. It's special effects and 3D are fantastic. Whenever you see the animals and human extras, you even wonder if their completely CGI. Of course whenever I saw Richard Parker I knew it was going to be computer-generated, but I've just learnt that four real tigers were used in some shots. and you still can't tell which is which. It would have been completely impossible to film right out at sea, so thanks to computer-generated imagery, it couldn't be easier. The 3D effects are incredible (like Martin Scorsese's Hugo but in a different way). This isn't a gimmick. No. These are unlike the other 3D films we see today in which 3D is sometimes unnecessary. Lee (I think) uses 3D almost like they use it on 3D wildlife channels on 3D TV. In this film the animals look as real as on a wildlife programme. You wonder how they manage it, and that's what gives the film an amazing look. At one point it feels like the sea will spill into the cinema. You'd be amazed. Life of Pi is a film that should be seen in 3D to experience the special effects. It isn't the best film I've ever seen but I still think it's spectacular. A must-see!","10/10"
"tonypeacock-1","18 January 2024","Jason Statham films are so predictable to me it appears. In fact every one of his films I watch could have the same review template! I don't have much choice about not watching the films as he is a favourite actor of my wife?It requires little in the way of intelligence it is just easy going action fun. Which is what you want sometimes don't get me wrong!Here Mr. S. plays a retired U. S. Government secret service operative, Adam Clay who who looks after bees (hence the name of the film) in his spare time in between knocking two bells of **** out of people who upset him along the way. It later transpires that Clay was a member of a unit called The Beekepers.In this film, the target of the Beekeeper's anger is phishing criminals who clear out people's savings. In one such case, the criminals exploit the retired schoolteacher who The Beekeper is renting a garage off for his Beekeeping activities.

Sets up for a sequel as well. Like the bricklayer and the painter he's just an average Joe living a peaceful life as a beekeeper until he's driven out of ""retirement"" by forces unseen who destroy his benefactor and friend in a viscous data hack and causes them to commit suicide. There are a few people out there in todays world that do go after these despicable groups who do this heinous hack crime and kudos to all of them. This is taking it to the next level, makes me wonder if the current administration did the same thing to get elected, who knows. Most enjoyable fun I've seen in years.

What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.","6/10"
"Top_Dawg_Critic","26 April 2019","The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10","10/10"
"Top_Dawg_Critic","30 April 2018","A film that exhilarates and cheats you at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes. Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.","9/10"
"Top_Dawg_Critic","6 September 2023","Nothing is ever going to compare or be as epic as the original blockbuster films, but at least this film was a nice send-off. The production value of the sets, props, landscapes and s/vfx were outstanding. The score was the same as the original films, so that complimented this one. All casting and performances were spot-on. What dragged this film down was the the second act. The first and last acts were excellent and were as close to having the magic the earlier films had, but the middle act felt too long and dragged out, that made the 154 min runtime feel like it was much longer. Had the middle cut some of the filler out, I feel the entire film would've been more enjoyable. Nevertheless, a decent final installment and farewell to the franchise.","3/10"
"torgis","20 February 2023","I might be the last person on earth who doesn't compare every movie I watch to another, I feel like comparisons can ruin any movie for someone.I thought this one was a pretty good movie. I can't say there was a moment I remember where I was genuinely concerned for the main characters' well-being or safety, or any memorable ""emotion"" moment (but to be fair, that doesn't happen too often). I was a little annoyed with Janet for a good portion of it and I'm still not a huge fan. I liked Cassie, thought her character was a pretty good interpretation of the comic character, but much smarter. I agree it wasn't as light-hearted as previous Ant-Man appearances, but I think the situation warranted it. I loved Kang, thought that was done very well. Interested to see how it plays out in the long-run.","2/10"
"toutouguy","30 January 2019","Action was insane, one of the most intense and best anime fight scenes I've seen in a long while. However, do not like the idea that Broly might be stronger than a destroyer though. Goku and Vegeta should be the ultimate (strongest) fighters of Universe 7 imo and for that reason this movie gets a 9 instead of 10 lol","10/10"
"ToxicJug","28 June 2021","War for the Planet of the Apes may not be as good as its two predecessors but it still manages to send the trilogy off on a high note. I may have mentioned this in both of my reviews for the previous two films but its simply impossible not to mention when reviewing this trilogy. The visuals throughout this film absolutely steals the show! War for the Planet of the Apes easily has the most convincing visual effects of the entire trilogy which is obviously an impressive feat to say the least. The action sequences are also incredible as expected from this trilogy by this point. Where the film falls behind for me in comparison however, is it's pacing as well as its ending. War is paced nowhere near as well as the first two and can feel a bit slow and even boring at times which was a major issue for me. Ontop of that the ending just wasn't satisfying for me at all especially given that it was the finale of Cesar's story. Cesar's story and his legacy is something that has been built throughout the entirety of this trilogy and ends rather abruptly within this film.. other than those issues, this is still an incredible sci-fi action film that will tug on your heartstrings as much as it will have you cheering on the edge of your seat!","1/10"
"tpcatoz-90650","13 November 2021","I've watched this movie countless times and it is just flawless and is truly the Empire Strikes Back of the MCU.From start to finish Infinity war provides top of the line action, funny moments and great dialogue. It puts together so many characters and balances it all out beautifully. The movie also provides beautiful cinematography.I will recommend this movie to anyone til the day I die. Thank you Marvel for making such an awesome movie.","5/10"
"traceytak","24 November 2023","Ok so I understand she is flavour of the month but this film became unwatchable as soon as she appeared in it. I loved the Indiana films up till this one and it started out good. Mars is great casting, he plays his part well. But the character played by Phoebe is just so unlikeable and horribly british (which I am too but she is an embarrassment in this) and I think there must be plenty of other actresses that could have played it far better. Maybe she just belongs in downtown abbey but she is very one sided. Harrison has the capability of doing a really good job but I'm sorry to say in this he was completely let down by his supporting actress.","7/10"
"tranat71","8 September 2023","Watching this final Indiana Jones movie reminded me of the comparison between the old original SW (Episodes IV, IV, VI) vs the newer SW. The old original SW and Indiana Jones movies were masterpieces The newer SW and Indian Jones movies were/are pure crap.Everything is just boring as heck and completely drawn out.I don't even know what else to say. I felt like this movie was written and directed by some idiots, but I know that this movie was written by some really excellent writers and directed by a good director. So I am not sure what the heck happened here.Oh, shoot. I do know what happened. Disney happened! Disney will turn anything into crap.","7/10"
"trebordjackson","6 May 2019","I saw Avengers Endgame and it was incredible I absolutely loved it. The only blemish on this otherwise perfect movie is Captian Marvel she is the most *obnoxious* characters I have ever seen in my entire life. Annoying, Stone cold, smug, unsimpathic, ridiculously overpowered when Thanos punches he she just takes it WHAT THE ACTUAL H**L. All the other characters can barely land a punch. She flies through Thanos' ship like it is cardboard. She is a very unnecessary charcater. What bugged me the most is that when all the other Avengers were depressed even poor Thor was trying to drink his troubles away. Then this sarcastic a**hole comes in completely insensitive to them. What is wrong with you! Horrible Horrible Charcater. It reminds me of the Spongebob episode *Artist Unknown*. Squidward was the art teacher. Spongebob came in and was perfect at everything while barely trying. Only that was annoying for comedy purposes this is annoying for bad writting purposes.","8/10"
"TreeFiddy53","14 August 2023","I had a chance to watch this in IMAX/Dolby, chose not to. I regret that decision now. If you're like me and haven't watched it yet, please go to the theater and don't get a digital rent/wait for streaming.Getting back, this has easily shot up to the top of my list of movies I enjoyed this year, by far the favorite. I'm probably late with this so I'll keep it short.Visuals - STUNNING! I haven't seen these many colors in an English film before.Animation and Editing - EPIC! I have no idea how much effort went into making the Paramount Pictures/Sony logo and editing it to get the glitch effect, let alone the entire film. *slow claps*
Music and Sound Design - AMAZING! The OST and the way it's been used throughout the film - I'd watch it again for this and the visuals alone.Writing - AWESOME! It's not easy write for a film, I can't begin to think how tough it would have been to write something to bring everybody in and make a Spider-society without making it feel choppy. And I am not even going to attempt to comment on the writing for the storyline.A cinematic experience like nothing else - don't miss this in big screens. You can always re-watch on digital/streaming.","10/10"
"treeline1","29 November 2012","A young boy's family is moving their zoo animals from India to Canada when a storm sinks their freighter. The only survivors are Pi, a hyena, a zebra, and a tiger named Richard Parker, who find themselves in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean.On the plus side, I liked that the movie was faithful to the book. The photography and special effects were breathtaking; director Ang Lee has created a dreamy, magical, and stunningly beautiful world for Pi. The CGI tiger was excellent; I could not tell when he was drawn and when he was real. The soundtrack is lovely.On the down side, I found myself glancing at my watch at times, wondering when it would be over. The pace was too slow for me and I think it would have been an even better movie had 15 minutes been cut from it.The acting was outstanding and fans of the wonderful book will not be disappointed.","4/10"
"trevormenard","15 July 2023","Was it great? No. Was it watchable? Yes. Harrison ford always steals the show no matter what the content is. A true professional and veteran at the craft. Was not a fan of the female lead. Very aggressive and annoying and nagging and argumentative. Like.... I think Indiana jones knows what he's doing at this point. He doesn't need you arguing every decision he makes. Chemistry just wasn't there. I LOVED Mads Mikelssen as the antagonist along with Boyd Holbrook as his sadistic right hand man. Very convincing...Mads never disappoints. Wish there was more content for Antonio Banderas though...I was very intrigued when we met this character only to leave him after only 10 minutes of screen time. Not the best Indian Jones film...but definitely better than Crystal Skull.","6/10"
"trevorwomble","29 January 2024","This is actually one of Statham's better films of the last few years. An original story about a mysterious agent seeking revenge on the despicable con men who indirectly caused the death of his friend and neighbor starts a chain of events that spiral out of control.This is pretty standard stuff for Statham but it's very well directed by David Ayer and has a good solid cast. Statham was never particularly good at accents but at least his weird hybrid is explained in the story. However as expected he excels at the well filmed action sequences, and although there is a certain preposterousnesd that someone as distinctive looking as him can somehow keep evading capture without a disguise, his coolness in a gunfight is part of his charm. It's just the Stath doing what he does best, beating people up who step in the way of his retribution for an evil act.There's blood, gore and violence as well as bad language (although he rarely swears here) and the film is a great popcorn movie providing you don't mind that sort of thing. Statham may not be the worlds greatest actor but he's not terrible either. He knows what he's doing in films like this and does it very well, especially with a solid director like Ayer behind the camera.","6/10"
"Treyroo","20 December 2012","What would you do if you found yourself orphaned, alone and in the middle of the ocean? Drown, surrender, pray? Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator. We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.","9/10"
"triadne","17 February 2023","This was really disastrous combination. The Antman films have come to be known for comedic moments so when they pivoted to such a serious story with such a supposedly threatening and monumental bad guy, you expect a tone change, but then along comes a certain character and brings down the whole thing with absolutely pathetic humour and the worst looking special effects I've seen in years. This is on the level of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, or Jar Jar Binks. It's really bad.Then there is the tropes that have become all too common for mcu movies at this point; large scale battle, cross cutting between individual characters, misplaced comedy... All detracts from at least one really powerful moment, that could have made the core of a fantastic movie, a moment when Scott regains his focus and works toward one goal rather than being drawn in all directions, that was very powerful.This is just the latest MCU product though and exhibits the same issues that I have been starting to notice in the past few years. At this point it's hard to ignore and it's stifling any creativity and good storytelling. This will probably be the last MCU movie I pay for.","8/10"

"trinaboice","1 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
This is only Part 1 of a two-part sequel. Sweet! Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team.Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.THINGS I LIKED:
The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out!The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham.The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time.We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses.Lots and lots of action!The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It's the largest crew of any animated movie ever made!So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow.This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that...two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can't see it all.I've never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material.I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. Haha
I've always loved animated movies that include live-action characters.The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment.Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet.There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual.I've just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It's another fun adventure into the metaverse!You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you'll understand and appreciate it even more if you have.If you love Hailee Steinfeld's character of Gwen Stacey, you'll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn't actually end at the end and they'll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024.Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don't have time to really savor the moment.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not just some random kids' movie. It's very mature and filled with humor and insights that adults can enjoy.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles.!","6/10"
"tristanostara","12 February 2024","Verona Parkers Character was terrible, and her acting was terrible , scrunch up your face and throw a tantrum like a child then storm into building with teams of marines and mercenaries spraying bullets every, all the while hindering the guy that's avenging her mothers death and punishing the people responsible for ripping off her mother,the other replacement female ""bee keeper"" was way too comical and never stood half a chance ,
other than that I thought the movie was fantastic they make a sequel asapjust dont put that horrible verona Parker in the film she sucked , good to see jason statham going hard out in the combat scenes.","8/10"
"TristanSilya","22 January 2019","Although I am a big Dragon Ball fan I went into this movie with no expectations except for expecting to see some cool animations and good fight scenes. This is so I can rate the movie with as least bias as possible.I believe if you're completely new then it may be a very shallow and confusing movie and the only thing that might do it for you is the animation and fights.Pros:Animation is very fun, exciting, and refreshing to watch.Gogeta looks amazing with all the blue effect and auras.Sound does a great job at conveying how strong and powerful the moves and hits and blasts are.Backstory helped set up the narrative and fights a little (more later).Has decent funny moments.
Cons:A little too much screaming, even for Broly. A few times in I was shaking my head and thinking, ""okay, I get it, they're overdoing it with the screaming."" Yes, it's Dragon Ball, they do that a LOT and they still overdid it here.When Goku was getting ""Broly Smashed"" in red form he was screaming like he was getting murdered although he sort of just let it happen. It did show that Broly was strong but it also showed how unnecessary Goku can be for no reason when we all know he can go blue form and prevent wasting time and taking a ton of damage for no reason.The last bit was pertaining to Broly. He was introduced as a very strong and loving boy who respects his dad and wants to protect Cheelai when she was getting bullied. He also explains how he made friends with a creature and how he wears it's ear as a sentimental piece. But they also push him as a brute, merciless, killing machine that has no self-control if he gets mad. During his fight he literally became an entirely different person, completely. Yes, he was strong but at the same time it felt like the Broly that we saw throughout the whole movie wasn't there. The explanation was that his dad, Paragus, raised him to be that way. If that were the case then he would also be a jerk when he is calm. Instead, he is a nice, honorable, caring and sentimental person until he fights and he transforms into a merciless monster that would hurt bystanders and innocent people as seen when he tries to attack Frieza (as far as he knew Frieza didn't do anything evil) and Whis for being in the way even though Goku/Vegeta were his main opponent. The fight DID start because he wanted to get revenge for being abandoned by King Vegeta but quickly turned into something more and entirely different. I wish they gave Broly a little more motive and control during the fight to give it a little more meaning and purpose.Some of the jokes were a little cringe-worthy and was a bit forced. One example is when Goku asked for a definition of a word right before a fight. I didn't like the break of tension that it did for me and wanted to hold on to the tension that was built up.","10/10"
"troublethedog","12 April 2022","I'm not gonna say much, but watch this movie. I have seen PLENTY of higher-tier Indian movies but none were that good besides this one GLARING exception, this movie is absolutely phenomenal and should be at the top of your list, gorgeous SFX, and a wonderful and imaginative story. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out hardcore.","10/10"
"Troy_Campbell","1 January 2013","A gorgeous motion picture that wears its heart proudly on its sleeve, this epic survival tale is sweet, poignant and thought-provoking. As castaway Pi (played in adolescent form capably by Suraj Sharma and as an adult by the phenomenal Irffan Khan) defies death whilst stranded on a boat with a ferocious Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker, themes such as religion, faith, companionship and solitude are all explored. The beauty in David Magee's screenplay (adapted from Yann Martel's best-selling novel) is that each audience member will walk away with their own opinions and feelings on the aforementioned themes, depending on intelligence, maturity and cultural upbringing. This is not a film about religion in itself, but the context is there if you wish to acknowledge it. Otherwise it's a movie about belief, and having the strength of conviction in whatever it is you do choose to believe in.If the story wasn't impressive enough, then Life of Pi also serves as a breathtaking display of visual splendour and wonderment. From the sweet opening credits to the majestic island that is inhabited by an untold number of meerkats in the final act, Ang Lee has put every ounce of effort behind the camera (and with his computer effects team) to create an awe-inspiring landscape, in 3D no less, for Pi to exist in. This is our world to be sure, but rarely has it been seen like this. Glowing jellyfish lighting up the way for a whale to jump out of the water at night, a sunrise mirrored in perfect symmetry by the still ocean or a gigantic freighter sinking to the plumbs of the Pacific; every shot is one of glorious realisation that could easily be photographed and hung on a wall. Most importantly, Richard Parker is rendered utterly believable thanks to the seamless combination of a real tiger and flawless CGI. A bona fide masterpiece.","8/10"
"Troy_Campbell","29 July 2017","A trilogy-closer for the modern Planet of the Apes outings, we reunite with ape leader Caesar (a motion captured Andy Serkis) as he seeks to locate a safe haven for his clan whilst avoiding war with the humans. Trouble is, after the high-casualty conflict caused by Caesar's troubled right-hand ape Koba (Toby Kebbell – back here in dream sequences only) in the previous film, a battalion of men led by Woody Harreslon's ruthless Colonel are out for blood. Opening with two gripping battles—the first loud, intense and full of explosions; the second a suspenseful sneak attack with brutal results—the action stakes are set high and the narrative tempo is set fast. So much so the remainder of the movie struggles to maintain either. Screenwriters Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves continue the series' bleak theme of how narrow-mindedness causes self-destruction, the uncompromising sombreness and occasional over-sentimentality tolerable due to the immense intelligence and maturity imbued in the story. Reeves, who also directs, furthers this world primarily through character development, Caesar again proving to be one of the most complex and engaging protagonists in blockbusters today; his potency as a revered leader coming from the sacrifice and emotional turmoil he endures to protect his kind. Caesar's ability to captivate comes courtesy of a joint effort, with Serkis' passionate and tormented performance captured and enhanced by the visual effects team who then produce beautiful and flawless photorealistic CGI. There are also relatively minor moments littered throughout that have a lasting effect: meeting Steve Zahn's lonely and slightly crazy simian Bad Ape, Caesar's rage at the torture dished out to a slave ape, and mute girl Nova (Amiah Miller) quietly entering a prison to feed the hungry. It may not stick the landing due to a finale that strangely restrains Harrelson's villain, but it's easily forgiven thanks to the goodwill built by the franchise through crediting its audience as grown-ups who can engage with the weighty and intellectual themes on offer. Arguably the greatest trilogy since Nolan's Batman films, WFTPOTA provides this rebooted series with an appropriately epic, affecting and contemplative closing chapter.","9/10"
"Truedutch","28 June 2023","I think this is better than the crystal skull, I think the story was way more engaging and a better plot. Nazi's and Indiana Jones are required. It was a movie of up's and downs and I don't mean emotionally, I mean there would be a sequence I like but then straight after it would be an annoying sequence.I don't know about everyone else but I feel Indiana Jones was the worst part about this. The Daughter was also soooo good at everything of course and I also found it hard to hear her? Especially in the ludicrous chase scene in Tangier. I felt like the kid added zero to this film apart from having him there the whole time just to follow them through the time portal to fly them home. The first 45 minutes there were about 50 one punch knockouts with also about 10 captures of Indiana where you're left thinking just maim the guy or kill him. He escapes so many times it blows your mind.Mads was great as the villain but seemed to just have that timing like the French guy from raiders of the lost arc, just always turned up jusssst as Indiana worked something out.I did enjoy the mystery solving I'm a sucker for that and some good action mixed in with some average action I'm fine with. I was glad that at the end they went full speed into the ending and didn't hold back, I was hoping they were actually going back in time and I loved that they did and didn't fake out not go through the portal.If you like Indiana Jones and didn't like Crystal Skull you'll still go see this.","6/10"
"trumpsportal","8 July 2023","Disney is becoming more and more synonymous with disaster and desperation. This movie gets a 10 on both these measures. A complete and utter disaster and desperately poor on any measure.The film is a series of geriatric movie ""chase scenes"" with no originality, defined purpose or any reason to merit interest, from the viewer.Harrison Ford is his usual self, only he is now old and tired. It is just another movie where Harrison Ford is once again, Harrison Ford, but, this time, reading lines from a completely unoriginal and banal script.There is no meaningful story line, original or inspiring script to support his complete lack of the remotest semblance of any acting skills.To top it off the leading ""actress"" role is played by an equally talentless British ""comedienne"" who contributes nothing but pure ham to this movie salad.The movie is only successful in so far as, it has completely destroyed the Indiana jones franchise and any hope of a sequel.RIP Indiana Jones.","7/10"

"Turfseer","27 December 2012","Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who his father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.In the end, the Life of Pi 'main course' will be remembered for Pi's 'story #1' and Ang Lee's masterful visual presentation. The rest, including the lumbering narration, simplistic spiritual stance and ambiguous alternative ending, are the leftovers.","10/10"
"turleymjennifer","20 June 2023","I had such high hopes for this sequel, but the extreme artistic liberties with the constantly shifting backgrounds made it difficult to follow the dialog, the emotional scenes lost their impact for me when the characters were changing colour with every camera angle shift.I enjoyed the continued character development and additions of all the new spidermen, but I just could not get past the non stop swirling, flashing and dripping colours.The extreme use of the glitching and flashing graphics had me closing my eyes for periods of time just to get a break, as well it made the fight scenes and swinging scenes very difficult to follow.I understand the first movie had taken liberties with artistic aspects as well but I feel the second film was just over done with them.I still love the story line and where the film is going I just hope for my heads sake they tone it down a little in the next film.","9/10"
"Tweekums","10 December 2014","This story opens with a writer visiting our protagonist; an Indian named Pi. He wants to hear the story of how Pi survived alone on a lifeboat after a shipwreck; Pi corrects him he wasn't alone he had Richard Parker for company. As Pi introduces his story we learn how he got his name, his unusual 'multi-faith' belief system and most importantly we learn that Richard Parker is an adult Bengal Tiger! His father runs a zoo in their hometown but when it looks like they can't continue running it he decides to emigrate to Canada with his family and the animals. Shortly after entering the Pacific Pi goes on deck to watch a storm then Pi finds himself thrown into a lifeboat as the ship starts to sink. He isn't alone; part of the menagerie is with him an injured zebra, an orang-utan and a vicious hyena. The hyena soon kills the zebra and orang-utan then the previously unseen tiger erupts from under a canvass and kills the hyena; it then turn its attention to Pi. He gets out of its reach and constructs a raft so he can keep away from the creature. Over the course of the film he comes to realise that Richard Parker's presence is keeping him sane while never forgetting he is still on the menu!This film was a delight. Even though we know Pi must survive to tell his tale there are plenty of tense moments and I was genuinely concerned for Pi's safety. For most of the film we are just watching Pi and the tiger; this works because both characters are so believable perhaps a little surprising when one knows the tiger didn't exist it is however the best CGI I've seen; it is hard to believe it isn't real. Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a great job convincing us that he is on a small boat in the middle of the ocean with a tiger. The whole film looks great; at times it takes on an almost dream like quality as the boat is becalmed on a mirror flat sea and when the sea lights up thanks to bioluminescent plankton. Some may find the ending a bit of a cop out as it appears that much of what we have seen didn't actually happen; an alternate scenario is presented and, as Pi says, the viewer must decide which story they prefer.","10/10"
"Tweetienator","1 October 2017","I was never a fan of the new versions - imo the first Planet of the Apes from 1968 with Charlton Heston is way better than the new ones altogether. The first one of the new movies was okay, but this last one is just bad.On top the guy responsible for that bad kitsch soundtrack should be banned from making any kind of music for a movie ever ;) Some scenes spiced with that cheesy music - I really had a good laugh, but I think there was some other emotional reaction from the audience intended or the ""drums"" as Woody hit first time the screen, jeez, really bad stuff it is. And the piano plong plong, really, mostly a not so good soundtrack at least doesn't disturb me, but this is an exceptional example of kitsch. If I ever get caught by whatever mad-hatter and tortured with that soundtrack I will be dead within the hour :DSumma summarum: you get a lot of apes, standard CGI-action, and a plot that could be the script for some C-Western from the 50s.This and last year Hollywood's output mostly really sucks - one by one bad or mediocre movies are released: even big franchises (Tarzan, King Kong, Apes, King Arthur, Transformers etc.) or big actors can't save or disguise the fact that most of the stories told are just bad and ueber-generic stuff, in comparison even the cheap stories published in the good old pulp magazines read like the writings of Satre or Kafka himself.","4/10"
"Tweetienator","19 April 2023","No wonder all those ""creative"" people in so called creative businesses and crafts are afraid of AI - no doubt, in the not too distant future, AI will do the work - cheaper and better than humans can do. At least if Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and such movies (and books, comics, whatever, quantity beats quality these days - in all fields) are the best human mind can come up with. The first Ant-Man movie was a nice one, the second one was okay, but if you take away all the (finally by computer generated) visuals and effects, there is maybe enough story left in this third chapter to employ two or maybe three and a half brain cells of the viewer. The rest of the neural network goes quickly into stand by and sleep mode. I like the production and a few scenes, this is the only reason why this one does not crash totally. But in the end, this is at best mediocre and sometimes even really bad.","7/10"
"TxMike","18 November 2017","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are great, the several explosions made my viewing room shake. Of course you need a good powered subwoofer for that.This all started, moviewise, with the 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"", based on an earlier French book. In that story 20th century space travelers somehow zip to the far future where Apes are the intelligent species and what we know as Humans are the ones captured and caged. At the end we see the remnant stubble of the Statue of Liberty and realize something very bad happened on Earth.The current series of Apes movies actually fill in that space in time between a catastrophic event and the rise of the intelligent Apes. In this version it isn't a war, it is Simian Virus stemming from experiments with caged Apes.The Ape leader is again Andy Serkis as Caesar, raised from very young by a human family, and as a mature Ape speaks well and has human qualities. All the surviving Apes want to do is live peacefully in their home in the forest.That plan is upset by Woody Harrelson as the rogue military Colonel. He and his men seek to exterminate the Apes and that conflict is the core of the story here. We can look at it as sheer entertainment, we sense that Apes becoming human-like is just a Sci-Fi fantasy. Or we can look at it as an allegory, those with power seeking to dominate others.The cutest character is an Ape named ""Bad Ape"" and played by Steve Zahn. He had learned to talk and when in captivity had often been yelled at ""bad Ape"" so he came to think that was his name. A wrinkle in this story is that the virus gradually allows Apes to develop the ability to speak, and at the same time gradually renders Humans unable to speak.It runs over two hours but never seems long.","1/10"
"TxMike","28 March 2013","""Life of Pi"" is one of those stories that get you thinking and people talking about ""what does it all mean?"" The line, near the end, where adult Pi asks the writer, ""Which story do you prefer?"" is telling, because he doesn't say ""Which story do you believe?"" This is not a story with one definite answer of what really happened on the boat, at sea for most of a year. The author of the source book doesn't even take a stand, he wrote it to be a modern day fable, a well-told yarn.I find the movie best enjoyed just by watching it and enjoying the story, and the beautiful cinematography without worrying too much about deeper meanings. It is a story about young Pi (short for Piscine) Patel who has a personal exploration with spiritual matters, and when he finds himself at sea in a lifeboat, with an adult Bengal Tiger, he uses his faith, his belief in God, to carry him through and trust in ultimate survival. And it doesn't matter if any individual viewer believes in God, only that young Pi does.Suraj Sharma is teenager Pi Patel in the 1970s, his family is forced to sell their zoo animals, all are on board a Japanese freight ship when, in a mighty storm the ship sinks, and the next morning Pi finds himself sharing the boat with an injured Zebra, a Hyea, and after a while, hiding under the tarp, Richard Parker, the adult Bengal Tiger. Eventually only Pi and Richard are left on the boat, and much of the movie is their saga of survival before eventually landing on the beach of Mexico.The movie starts and ends in modern times, with Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi Patel, a college professor living in Canada with his wife and two children. An author, Rafe Spall as the Writer , is there to learn of Pi's story and write a book. In the end as Pi tells of the Japanese representatives of the shipping line visiting him in the hospital, they found his story hard to believe. So he told them a second, different, simpler story. When the writer questions the stories, searching for an answer, Pi asks, ""Which story do you prefer?"" The author of the book things we should prefer the first story, because everyone else dies anyway, but it is a much better story.I have it on Blu-ray, the picture and sound are both just great. Definitely a movie to re-enjoy periodically.","6/10"

"tyler-catanzarite","26 July 2019","This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.
TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie","7/10"
"tylerharris-96526","6 July 2023","Go see Asteroid City, Indiana Jones 5 is definitely not worth your timeI dont know where to start
Even without the bad cgi, shoehorned-in poorly acted sidekicks, disjointed boring plot and strangely minimal (mostly absent) performance from Mads, this is the worst Indiana Jones movieThe long intro with cartoon young Harrison Ford is briefly intriguing but really shows that they should have either replaced Harrison Ford by now or spun off into a different tomb-raiding franchiseHe's simply too old to pull off any of this action
I tried suspending my disbelief, but his line delivery was dull, the writing itself was dull, the story and characters were flat and dull, and with so little substance to engage with, I was forced to study his performance for 2 hoursEven the science fiction 'twist' at the end was mild, pointless and stupid. I would call it hamfisted but that would make it sound more interesting than it was. Contrived and meaningless just like the rest of this dead fish- LAME.If you're still considering seeing this, don't. It was vapid, boring, dumb and annoying.","10/10"
"tymbus","16 July 2017","I have never felt so out of step with popular critical opinion, but I found War for the Planet of the Apes dreary to say the least. If you are going to call a film "" War for.."" then It is best to actually stage a war rather than a battle for sympathy. As much Disney's Incredible Journey as anything else, WFTPA follows a group of apes led by Caesar in a mission to scout out an advancing army of humans only to find the rest of their ape kind have already been captured in a battle that we don't get to see. A poster showing apes charging towards troops in bogus Barnum and Bailey hucksterism ie a lie.All the positive reviews have focused on the pixelated puppetry of motion caption and the CGI rendering. Yes it is excellent...to an extent. I was totally convinced human actors bought these characters to life. The apes are so real that it just drew attention to the way the virus that give them intelligence also made them act out of character. Gorillas, for example, are not aggressive killers, orangutans aren't wise old men and where are the bonk crazy Bonobos? (They never get a look-in in the Apes movies - too busy shagging I guess)Woody Harrelson plays a psycho human supremacist fighting to eliminate a mutation in the virus that is making humans speechless. But, only minutes in to his performance, I realized that since Donald Trump's election, I was tired of watching aggressive, racist Americans. Harrelson's character is just another of the many clichés of which the film is entirely made.There are some very specific quibbles: the aged 'Bad Ape' isn't the comic relief the makers think. His back story is confused and his former home : a zoo, quarantine center, prison looks nothing like any of these. Since when were zoos just big cages? The concentration camp is strangely under populated with human guards and those that are there fail to spot hundreds of apes vanishing down all too conveniently already made escape tunnels. There's no emotional investment in the human vs human conflict and the climax (spoiler alert)in which everyone bar a few chimps is wiped out in an avalanche is unexpected and narratively ridiculous. It is as if the writer couldn't think how to resolve the established conflict. More to the point it undermines the mythic story arch - that's how most of humanity died? In snow? Perhaps the 'white out' was supposed to be satirical but it is unlikely. Even the building of a wall (to keep out humans) fails to resonate.So what we are left with is a human family revenge drama in ape form. Not even the nods to the original Apes movies raise this film beyond a character piece. Again this focus on family is incongruous. Chimpanzees in the wild are promiscuous. So not only have they developed the ability to speak and think, the Apes here have also mutated into middle class family units. And again, the reality of the rendering calls attention to the unreality of the fictional universe. In a way, the original prosthetics and performances were better because they called attention to the satirical intentions of many of the scripts (particularly Planet and Escape).Taken as a whole, this film is just dull. CGI rendering and motion caption may have progressed, but story telling remains in the past.","5/10"
"tyrantlizardthad","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","1/10"

"u-70359","21 January 2020","Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a beautiful adaptation of a bestselling novel by Yann Martel. It chronicles a young mansu journey to survive after a storm leaves him stranded in the middle of the ocean. The film is colorful and draws the viewer in from the beginning.The story starts as the young Pi is a child in India. His family owns a zoo. Early on we see the dangers of how fierce these animals can be and why they are in cages. Pi father makes the difficult decision to close the zoo when it goes broke. The family and a few precious animals board a ship headed to Canada. Along the way a storm sinks the ship leaving Pi as the only survivor along with a few of the zoo animals. They are cast adrift in the ocean and forced to survive with the hopes of being rescued. This reminds me of James Cameron's ""Titanic"" (1997), when Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet we're clinging to life in the cold Atlantic waiting for a rescue boat.The director and cinematographer use several camera angles and CGI (computer generated images) to detail the boys journey. The tiger is obviously CGI although some real animals were used in close up shots. The camera appears to be in the water following the boy, this is the viewpoint we see. Almost all of the movie takes place on open water. They do land on a floating island with trees and plenty of food to eat.The script is relatively short on dialogue. 75% of the movie I'd Pi on his own. The story gets detailed on how he adapts to life on a raft with a bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Due to natural selection the tiger is the last remaining animal. He and Pi end up having a mutual respect and understanding while adrift. Most of the script is told in the narration of Pi's journey.The young actor does a great job of seeming unmoved by the events that happened to him. One would think he is either in shock or somehow accepting of what happened to his family. Never once does he give up. He makes the view believe he is confident in finding a way to survive. In the end you feel his sadness when his companion, the bengal tiger, walks away into the jungle.The movie does move along slowly, but I blame that on screenwriter David Magees lack of material. The bulk of the story takes place at sea and perhaps it could've moved along faster if the director and writer would've used flashbacks to Pi's life. This could've been used to move the journey along and also give viewers a chance to connect with Pi on a more human level by showing how important his family was.I highly recommend ""Life of Pi"" for its beautiful cinematography and endearing story. The young actor is bold and believable and the CGI did a good job of showing the viewer this fierce beast. It's 127 minutes which could've been shortened up with a few changes in script but overall one of the best movies of 2012.","1/10"

I will admit, it's not an entirely perfect movie and I admit, the comedy was really funny but at some points in my own humble opinion it was a bit over done. But I will say that this movie is the best dragon ball movie to come out in years, there's a reason why it's the highest grossing dragon ball movie of all time and there's a reason why so many people, not only in Japan but around the world... completely enjoy this movie. Im glad I got the chance to watch this, I'm glad we got to see broly in action again after so many years and I'm extremely glad that broly is finally canon in the main story of dragonball.

"Uncle-Feggster","15 June 2018","Sometimes, when I read reviews about movies on IMDb, I see patterns in the writing. Similar text, similar structuring and similar indignant shouting. Read enough of them and you see that quite often there is an underlying reason why the reviews are marking a film so low. Be it political or religious. Very rarely is it actually about the quality of the film. More often it is about a personal issue that the reviewer has - and so he vents his anger in the only way that's he knows how - a screaming one star rating and a list of reasons why the film is the worst he has ever seen. Makes you wonder what kind of a strange person would do that.However, if you read past all the silly 1 star ratings you often get to the truth. And the truth as far as this film is concerned is that it is a cracker. It draws you in like none of the other ape movies - it's pacing is superb, the visual effect stunning. I would suggest that you ignore the ranting 1 star reviews and take them for what's they are - a few individuals with multiple accounts and strange views on the world.","8/10"

The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out.

The important aspects after this just wanted to express I had a peculiar experience with a few errors.Anyways about the movie I love the magnitude of science mashed throughout, loads of humor more than most Marvel movies, great action, and wonderful story! No matter what anyone thinks of the movie Jonathan Majors deserves awards in his career even its not this his performance was exceptional and Kathryn Newton is so much prettier than ever before.

Michael Douglas & Bill Murray phone it in and still manage to steal scenes.I'm probably going to watch the rest of the phase by inertia, but damn, this is a far cry from anything in Phase 2-3.","4/10"
"unsure-1","17 January 2024","I liked this movie. It's fun. It tried to go for a twist (a bit predictable), and of course as many have noted, it's very close to John Wick. No it's not a secret society of assassins, it's a government program that goes above the law. But it's a rogue retired super pro who everyone is afraid of. He goes on a revenge spree, and then continues more in the name of justice. And then also because it turns out that the beehive needs a new queen or whatever.The worldbuilding rules here are worse than John Wick. John Wick's world has style and nuance. It's inspired by eclectic influences.This is inspired by GI Joe morning cartoons and someone who read a book on bees.Jason Statham plays Jason Statham. (At least he gets a bit roughed up closer to the end, so he's not completely invincible.)We're all going to watch the sequel.","2/10"
"upashnafuentes","25 April 2018","This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.","10/10"
"urthpainter","25 July 2017","Seriously needs to reevaluate the criteria by which they review films. Why? Because giving this film 1/10 says, ""I am ignorant of quality film making."" Descriptions like slow and boring just don't cut it! Opinions like this are an act of ultimate laziness - the inability to mentally invest in the passive experience of a film. An inability to invest in a well made film that has something to say no less.Everyone has the right to an opinion - but when a person abandons merit before their eyes, and quality film making is overlooked by choice? That is simply, unfortunate. I can continue to admonish those without taste, but what good is that?War for the Planet of the Apes isn't a good movie - it's a Great movie!!! I thought part one was above average, part two was surprisingly good - but this movie? Its a borderline classic!In a nutshell, War for the Planet of the Apes is a struggle for survival between Caesar's group of sentient apes (gorillas, orangutans), and a derelict group of soldiers led by a broken/crazed leader. This fight begins as open warfare but moves to very close quarter survival between captors and prisoners. There is a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences - and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Normally I am very critical of this type of film, but not this time! Everything serves the characters and story - and in doing so becomes a project that far exceeds the sum of its parts. Yes this movie has death, suffering and plight - and it also has heroism, empathy and displays the strength of unity.The effects are astonishing - and immediately allow the viewer to slip into the world in a believable way. It is possible that this movie is 5 years ahead of its time. It may be a while before another film achieves this level of drama, all while being a heavily effect driven experience.Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to selfish, ""give me action"" needs. More science fiction should be this brave and literate. I love movies that ask interesting questions and can bring you on an emotional adventure. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films - good movies in their own right.Way more I could talk up: great soundtrack! The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action - the best kind of soundtracking - beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters, many of whom never utter a word of dialog! This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.For me, best movie of the 2017 summer - maybe the year!All the 1* reviews at IMDb are a mystery... audience approval for this movie isn't this low. Very odd, anyways for those who care, critics got this one right - 9/10.","9/10"
"User145111","4 January 2024","A mixed bag of a movie. It was okay in some places but there is a disconnect between what is said and what happens. Indi can jump between vehicles but has trouble climbing up a rock-face. Is he too old for this or not? Characters are introduced that are allegedly a large part of Indi's life but he doesn't have a connection to them at all; at least it doesn't seem like it. Helena is painfully unlikeable and seems more like the villain of the piece instead of the deuteragonist. Just let Indi live in the past. It's all he's ever wanted.The de-aging is passable at times, such as in long shots or when seen in relative darkness, but can falter from time to time. Hearing 80 year-old Harrison Ford's voice coming out of 46 year-old Indiana Jones is incredibly distracting. Sallah should have been in more of the film instead of just as a glorified cameo. Killing of Indi's son was the best thing that could have happened to that character.","8/10"

It made me really think about how much people in my life mean to me and how much I mean to them. I have absolutely no idea how they were able to top the last one but they did. I'm a bit worried that they won't be able to top the next one though, all doubts set aside, I still think that they have the abilities to pull it off. That's why I am truly excited for the next one. By the way it is coming out at the end of march next year if anyone wanted to know. Hey at least it's not another 5 years like the last one.","10/10"
"uzair-36867","8 February 2021","This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","9/10"

"valadas","30 December 2012","Chiefly those at the sea including the stormy ones. It's actually a very well filmed movie from the technical point of view. The story is deep enough I mean the story of the boy in a boat with a tiger for 22 days after the shipwreck of the boat where both were travelling. Because as we see at the end this was only one of the two possible stories since the boy after having reached Mexico and been admitted to a hospital tells the representatives of the Japanese company that owned the ship a quite different story (although dramatic as well) after they told him they didn't believe in the first one. This feature of the plot enhances the quality of the film. Which one was true? We'll never know but both are very rich in their dramatic contents. The visual special effects are splendid and fortunately most of them were made by computer work since a few acts of cruelty against living animals (or presented as such) would have been to blame. Not exactly a very good movie but good enough and worth to be seen.","7/10"

"Valkavious","23 October 2022","It's been a long time since I have watched anything Dragon Ball related.I came across the movie on Netflix and thought I would give it a watch as I remember enjoying the old Broly movies from the 90s.This film was so much fun, with fantastic animation and humour, I will never tire of how angry Vegeta is, it always brings a smile to my face.I can't imagine how long it must take to make a movie like this, with how fast the animation is.It is a great prequel story to how Broly came about and what lead him to become the Saiyan that he is.The film just oozes power! The battle scenes are extremely impressive and I never found myself looking at the clock thinking is it nearly over?The script is entertaining, the music is cool and at a run time of 1h40 minutes I think it is the perfect length.Highly enjoyable from start to finish and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series.","10/10"
"vallscar","1 June 2023","Story ended before I knew! It ended abruptly, absolutely in the middle when things were finally getting better. I really wish they'd cut down on useless scenes and add a good, substantial ending kind of like part 1. I was also expecting more of Pavitr and Punk, also there was literally no Noire which made me sad. I honestly feel sad after watching the movie, I was waiting for it to end by the time intermission ended. I watched it in 4d and I honestly don't know what to say, it was meh. I'm hoping for part 3 to be better and make up for it. Feel like my money is somewhat wasted, but the animation was great. Story was stirring up well, but again same point, they ended it too abruptly.","10/10"
"Vamskye","18 February 2023","Quantumania was a very weird movie, & that's in a good sense. The movie is jam-packed with humor & action. The movie immediately delves into the Quantum Realm without wasting a second. The visual effects are amazing for most of the parts but, some parts were just god awful to look at.Talking about characters, Kang 100% carried the movie. Janet played an equally important role. Scott & Wasp were equally amazing. Kathryn Newton had some good moments but some of her line deliveries & dialogues were just cringe.MODOK & Quaz were wasted. They could've done so much with their characters. There's few clichés, which everyone could've seen it coming. It's obvious that they were plotting a different ending & it was changed in the reshoots. And of-course, some cringe dialogues.However, the strongest factor of this movie for me, was the plot. Decent story, weird execution.","1/10"

"vandykeu","17 August 2019","Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment.","10/10"
"vandykeu","2 July 2023","I saw this new addition to the Indiana Jones franchise yesterday, and I've taken some time to collect my thoughts on it. Upfront, I think it is mostly better than Crystal Skull, but it is nowhere near the level of the original three films. Broadly speaking, it avoids many of the problems that I had with that film, especially its just outrageous circumstances. Despite being films that rely on the supernatural for their plot points, Indy films are best when they are still rooted in basic physics. Look at Raiders and Last Crusade- you don't find too many instances in those films that are quite simply unbelievable. Here, for the most part, Dial of Destiny avoids those unbelievable circumstances (though Indy's hat not blowing off on the train in the beginning sequence does bother me at some level).I found the acting and the characters to be mostly pretty good. I liked the chemistry between Ford and Waller-Bridge. I liked the cameos. Where the film falls apart in this department is that none of the villains outside of Mikkelson are given much to do. Boyd Holbrook in particular is basically a lurching punching bag with an itchy trigger finger, and that is the extent of his development. The biggest surprise was Antonion Banderas, who I didn't recognize until about halfway through his performance. He was great.The downside to this film is the detail of its story. The concept is great, and fits well within the Indy universe. I in particular liked the more emotional moments where Ford had to actually do a bit of acting. This fits well in line with the emotional growth in Last Crusade and it was good to see. Likewise, the broad strokes of the plot and Helena's character made sense, but the details were very muddled. I didn't even really know where the plot was going until about 40 or 50 minutes in. Is Helena good? Bad? Good again? Bad again? It flip-flopped on her too many times, and not in ways that made sense. Outside of her first few minutes, I never once believed her motivations and it felt as if her motivations were created simply to build fake drama.The action sequences are far too long, which is only allowed because of their CGI nature. You couldn't make a film with such exhaustingly boring action scenes like this 30 years ago, which forced Spielberg to make smarter editing choices than he did even in Crystal Skull, and that problem continues here. You could shave a good 10 minutes off of each of the major action sequences and lose absolutely nothing from the film, and it would be better for it. It is, for all intents and purposes, and animated movie.After these details, my biggest complaint is that it looks too much like Crystal Skull. The lighting is too dark, too bright, and too soft. Like Crystal Skull, it just looks blown out and fake. Go back and watch the originals- especially Last Crusade- and look at how crisp the photography is. Even today, it looks incredible. The rotoscoping of scenes in front of Petra are noticeable, but still look really good. Here, nothing looks good. It's almost as painful on the eyes as was Crystal Skull, or the Hobbit movies. Why?As Ford's almost certain departure from Indy, I think it does ok by him. It allows him to complete his character in a way that makes sense. I am happy for him in that regard. As others have said, I am not sure that we needed this film for anything else, and I am not sure that its good points outweigh its bad ones. Being better than Crystal Skull is hardly a noteworthy accomplishment.","6/10"
"Vanmatta","29 June 2023","Where do u start first of all it keep with all the Indiana Jones films action, advantage, keeps u guessing what going to happen. From start to finish it's ride, Harrison ford not changes still the man and Phoebe Waller-Bridge such a great character, she pulls of action with easy. From train, planes, cars and boats it got it all baby. The thing I like about this film is u never know what going to happen which I like very much. The Germans are back in more than one way, there a scene which the north Yorkshire moors railway that set the pace and it's in the new mission impossible film. Anyway get down to the cinema and enjoy.","8/10"
"Vartiainen","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","1/10"

"vassiliskounelis","30 August 2023","""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny had its moments, but it left me with mixed feelings. While I enjoyed the overall adventure, I couldn't warm up to the character Helena. The film's focus on Greece was exciting in concept, but the execution fell short. The Greek references felt off, and the portrayal of the city didn't capture the essence of a Greek landscape. Additionally, the movie's length and pacing made it feel a bit flat, lacking the excitement I expected, especially for a finale. It was an okay watch, but far from the impressive conclusion I had hoped for.""It was a nice watch but could be better.","7/10"

"vautyodayoda","20 November 2023","This films quality depends on how you watched it and who you are. If you watched most of the MCU up to this point like I did then this will be a revolutionary endgame that redefines all of film culture. Otherwise it seems rather bad and underwhelming. The film has a forward moving plot, great acting and some CGI actually worth looking at. This film didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time for no reason. It does have some obvious flaws tropes and plot holes but other than that acts as a brilliant finale to the infinity saga. Now don't watch the multiverse saga. It willn't ruin your opinion but they aren't good sequels either. All in all a film worth watching if you have watched the entire MCU up to that point, otherwise an okay film. And watch infinity war before you watch this, otherwise literally nothing will make sense.","10/10"
"Venge","29 June 2023","Disney gets hold of the Indiana Jones franchise, and suddenly you have a Karine Jean-Pierre lookalike, globally round afro and all, doing double-duty as a CIA agent. However, apart from that lame attempt at political-correctness, Disney just let general silliness, plot holes, and questionable cast selections round out the rest of the movie. However, for all Disney's best efforts to ruin yet another film icon, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny turned out to be an enjoyable movie.I just saw the film this afternoon, so have had little time to reflect on it, but overall enjoyed myself. The first 20 minutes, with the de-aged Harrison Ford, were a lot of fun ... very much like old times. The middle part of the movie dragged somewhat, but it did all rise to a very nice climax. The post climax final scene was touching in a strange way ... no spoilers here though.The cast of the movie were good to merely OK. Harrison Ford was his usual brilliant self, playing a character he has owned for over 4 decades. However, I did not find Phoebe Waller-Bridge either likeable enough, nor a strong enough actor, to carry off the amount of screen time she was given. Mads Mikkelson played his usual very solid villain, a role he seems to have turned into a very nice career. Need a villain? Get Mads! However, the ""kid"" ... it seems every Indy movie has to have a kid ... played by Ethann Isidore, didn't seem to have a clue how to act in front of a camera. Maybe it was simply the fact that the role of ""the kid"" just seemed to be shoe-horned into the story line for no apparent reason whatsoever. Who was he? Where did he come from? And most of all, why did he have to be there?Overall, though, I'd give the movie the proverbial thumbs up, maybe simply because I'm a die-hard fan of the franchise, and saw the first instalment in the theatre way back in 1981. Maybe I just needed another chance to go see Indy one last time.","1/10"
"Venge","6 May 2019","Avengers: Endgame forgot that it was just a superhero, and suffered from trying to be far too ""epic"". Along the way, it lost the brisk pace and light humor that brightened up the first two movies of the series, as it tried to do too much, with too many characters, over too many needless scenes. The whole thing felt overly drawn out. 30 minutes of this film could easily have found it's way onto the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been stronger for it.In many ways, it was like the writer's of this installment lost their touch. The fat Thor joke was funny for the first 5 minutes, but they kept coming back to it again and again and again. Ya, ya, we know he got fat and lazy. Ha, ha. Now move on! But at least the overweight, drunken Thor gave us something to chuckle about, as there was very little else of a lighter, funny nature in this over-serious marathon of a movie.There was also far too much posing. A good example of this was during the huge final battle, with the fate of the world, nay the entire galaxy, hanging in the balance .... and all the female superheroes found the time to line up for a photo op! What was that all about? From across a battlefield that stretched over seemingly several square miles, all the female superheroes left whatever they were doing, in order to travel clear to where all the other female superheroes were, so that they could stand shoulder to shoulder and go ""Ok, girls, now that we're all here, lets look really serious and determined for the camera! Now, Charge!Ya, way overdone and unnecessary.As was the final funeral for .... SPOILER ALERT!! .... Ironman. I mean, come on. All that was needed was a nicely written 5 minute scene around his grave, or perhaps a memorial. What the movie didn't need was a 20 minute movie within a movie, tagged on to the end of what was already a very long film.But that was the story of this movie. Many scenes seemed overplayed and overwritten, and just a shade too long. I still enjoyed the movie, and still gave it a 7, but it could have been so much better if it had just relaxed and been more like the movies that had gotten us here. It simply tried too hard to be the greatest superhero movie of all time, and as a result, fell far short.","9/10"
"vengeance20","12 January 2024","I wasn't too sure about this one when I initially seen it advertised! I mean, I love Jason Statham & the films he does, but there's been a few which have been ok, but not great! And of course, given this film is a Sky Original, I was sort of skeptical it would be a cheap TV Film! Nonetheless, I went to see this anyway!The film follows The Beekeeper, a one man's brutal campaign for vengeance takes on national stakes after he is revealed to be a former Operative of a powerful & clandestine organization known as ""Beekeepers""! He'll stop at nothing to deliver raw justice to those who have it coming to them!I found the film to be ace! You just know within the first 15-20 minutes that The Beekeeper, AKA Jason Statham will deliver the goods as soon those responsible cross the line! The story-line is pretty good & straight forward! While it's not 100% unique, who cares! It's a simple story line with plenty of badarse action, explosions & fights to get you through the 1 hour & 40 minute (100 minute) runtime with some fast, high octane action!Jason Statham does it again in this film as he kicks arse & gets the job done! The other characters are pretty good & play their parts really well too! There's also some familiar faces as well so that's also a plus! I honestly, can't think of anything much negative to say about this flick, it's ace & probably one of the best action films I've seen in a long while!Overall, you won't be disappointed by this one, it exceeded my expectations & delivered so it did! Give it a watch, because I'm planning another visit to see this one again!10/10.","10/10"
"vengeance20","30 June 2023","So, having only seen bits & pieces of the other Indy films & of course, the last one which came out 15 years ago (I'm getting old!), we finally get this long awaited sequel which sees Harrison Ford in his role (for the final time) as the great Indiana Jones! This film however, wasn't the greatest & of course ruined by the modernness of today's climate...!The film sees Indiana Jones in his final in a new mission with a cocky arrogant, but ok sidekick Helena, who turns out to be his brothers daughter whom he hasn't seen in 18 years. Together, they set out to retrieve a Dial which can affect the course of history, which is in the hands of Jurgen Voller who plans on using it for his own personal gain.I found the film the film to be ok, I was expecting it to be much worse to be honest. But, saying that, it wasn't exactly much better. Compared to the last entry, this was a pretty mundane & tired out finale & way for Harrison Ford to bow out of the role as Indiana Jones. You could even see as the film plodded along at a sluggish 2 hours & 23 minutes, that Indiana wasn't being treated with the respect as a legacy character should. He was portrayed as a deadbeat almost.Pheobe Waller Bridge's Character, wow. I would say, the less said about her, the better. But, I can't help but mention what an arrogant, cocky, undermining little madame she was in this flick. She really gives off that ""modern woman"" vibe. That ""Look at me, I'm much smarter than you are you dumb male!"" & to think Daniel Craig hired her to ""spice up"" the script for that god awful Bond Film, No Time To Die. But, that's another rant for another time.Anyway, the action was good as with some of the fights & what salvagable scenes of Indiana being himself were good. The visuals & effects were good & the opening, I'd have to say, is probably the best part of the film. The villain played by Mads (Casino Royale) was good as the villain Jurgen.It's plain to see that Indaian Jones is side-lined in favour of Helena & made to look weak & helpless. Typical in today's climate of films which get hit with that posion. The length of the film is too long at a whopping 143 minutes. The runtime was pretty pittiful too & the film could've been edited down by a good 20-30 minutes. The story was ok, but all over the place & the ending was bitter sweet & weird. You didn't even know when the film was set in, so that was a niggle & like how Harrison Ford is portrayed in this film, the film feels tired & worn out.Overall, it's not too bad, but it's not exactly great. The little action we see, along with what little Indiana Jones was being allowed to be the hero of this flick, it fall very short. The ending while bitter sweet wasn't the greatest. The film is overly long & drawn out with a good villain I must say, but weak & washy story-line & one annoying & arrogant side kick who undermines our supposed leading man at nearly every opportunity. There's some great vissuals to be had along with a great opening & not bad effects. But compared to the 2008 film, this pales drastically in comparrison. If only this had got made before films went... posined with modern tripe. You know what I mean...4/10.","1/10"
"vengeance20","8 May 2018","Seriously when are these editors going to get their crap together & cut it! Hm? You don't need to drag a film on & on for what seems like an eternity! Cut the crap! Cut it!

They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets ""killed"", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!And the ending... don't make me laugh!! The ending could've happened much much sooner! So much so they dragged out a climax for this? I mean the ending was an insult alone, without the other reason being that it took them nearly an hour till they gave us this pile of horse crap! Oh my god!!Overall crap! DON'T watch! 2/10","9/10"

"ventelagekon","1 February 2024","This is a very good and cool film
If anyone feels that it's not good, it's only people who want to spoil the rating of this film
The plot is following a beekeeper (Jason Statham) after the lady he has been helping dies after being scammed and stolen from everything. He decides to go on the hunt for those that are responsible. Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen. Sure the dialogue can be a little repetitive with characters explaining a beekeeper and how they are meant to protect the hive which sure is explaining it to the audience of who this character is.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining action films from Jason Statham since the first Transporter films.","3/10"
"Venticap76","28 January 2024","I could not believe I was watching film rated 6.7 out of 10! This is a hideous parody on an action flick! The attempt to follow Equalizer!Jason Stratham did what he was suppose to do, the rest of the cast doesn't know what acting is.Such a disappointment! At some points I thought I was watching really bad version of Suicide Squad!I don't know how Jerome Irons agreed to be in it!Please avoid watching it. It is not a film for movie theaters nor it is for home viewing! I wanted to hold on to something but could not.If you have not seeing Equalizer 3, please watch it! Masterpiece in comparison!","1/10"
"vert2712","24 April 2019","I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it.","9/10"
"vibemarketingbkk","15 February 2023","I'm a huge Marvel fan, and I always look forward to every single Marvel Studios creation.However, this will probably go down in history as the worst Marvel movie ever made. It's slow, boring and extremely messy. Messed up storyline and I almost fell asleep 50mins in.It feels way too long despite only being 2 hours long. The beginning is messy and tries to be fun and giggly, but it's not really working that well. Some sequences are alright and a bit funny, but if funny is Guardians of The Galaxy - then this is not funny at all.. it's the worst Marvel movie...actually worse than Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness. This is also in the multiverse, and it is pure madness...that dissipates into pure boredom 🤣","1/10"
"vibhus-17780","1 June 2023","Here we come another month with another marvel content . Spider-man Across the Spider-verse is another great milestone to the animation movies , visuals were incredibly cool and gorgeous with variety animation styles . This time sequel easily surpasses it's predecessor , narration was great , comparing to it's precursor this movie take some time to build story , establishing characters and some breathe moment rather than just jumping into one action sequence to another , this actually gives us the depth of the characters and stories . Once again many characters and many Spidermans comes across this movie , each had good scope and characterisation . Voice actors did a good job in dubbing . Action sequence were literally roller coaster ride with some goosebumps moments . Background scores were mind blowing . Sound department did a great job in sound designing .Overall , a movie itself a great tribute and massive celebration for Spider-man and it's fans . Not only for marvel fans even general fans gonna like it . Highly recommended to watch it on big screen and experience the Spider-verse . Story isn't over yet , stage is now set up for ""Beyond the Spider-verse"" .","10/10"
"vicarious_tool","24 November 2012","I believe I have never seen a movie as picturesque and visually delightful as this one. It' a treat for the eyes, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, since this combined with the amazing coming of age story and good acting, dialogues makes this a great watch for everyone.The plot is nicely paced, maybe a little slow for some, but I feel that is necessary to hook one in and make the emotions portrayed feel true. However thanks to 'Richard Parker' there is also an element of thrill that keeps you on the edge time and again. These is a certain kind of purity to the story, but without compromising on subtlety and elegance. The scenes portrayed i.e. nighttime, sunsets, the lightning and storms, the exquisite variety of animals, underwater scenes; the rare but amazing quips and the beautiful analogy used as a 'proof of god' all on the whole left me strangely content when the movie ended, i.e. without the nagging need for 'more' that some good stories often leave behind.","10/10"
"Victor_Santamaria","30 January 2024","It is a great pleasure to see again this actor doing what he does best: kicking ass and in an outstanding way. Statham takes revenge in that film for what he needed so much and for which so many of us miss him. Pure highly entertaining action in a fine plot with even one last interesting twist when you thought everything was already served. He leaves a line of corpses and screwed people as long as the years he's been doing this.Fight choreography of the highest level and some in particular, like the last one, really very good and even the most credible. I had such a good time that not giving a 10 and getting lost in criticisms and certain considerations would be in bad taste for such a tasty honey.","2/10"
"view_and_review","14 August 2023","Wow, I was so amazed by this movie I watched it twice in two days. I liked the first movie. I loved the sequel. I can't wait for part three.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" picks up with Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) a couple of years older, in a new suit, and killin' the Spider-Man thing. Being Spider-Man has its drawbacks though. He's been missing school and his tardiness to different events has caused a strain between him and his parents, Jeff and Rio Morales (voiced by Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez).A rather innocuous battle with a villain named Spot (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) made Miles late to his father's retirement party which was the straw that broke the camel's back. His parents were fed up with Miles' behavior and his lame excuses.Before the movie jumped into Miles' story we got a glimpse of Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld) and what she was going through in her universe. She was having an even tougher time as her father, George (voiced by Shea Whigham), believed that she (as Spider-Woman) was responsible for the death of her best friend. She was saved from handcuffs by Miguel O'Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), the leader of an inter-universe Spider-beings legion that was responsible for preventing anomalies in the various universes. It was a big deal.Miles found himself at the HQ of the inter-universe Spider-Beings legion though he was uninvited. Things only got more dramatic from there.I was so deeply engaged in this movie I couldn't tell you if I was breathing or not. I'm sure I didn't blink. The movie got better and better as it went along. It was far deeper than I ever expected it to be and tons more entertaining. The storyline is perfection and some of the best writing I've ever seen from a comic book superhero movie.Some people have complained about the animation style. I say, ""Oh ye of little knowledge and appreciation."" The animation, which was a blend of various styles, was brilliant. Every style was a version of comic book illustration. Hobie (voiced by Daniel Kaluuya), who was Spider-Punk, wasn't even animated, he was a still illustration drawn in different poses and different positions and yet he was one of my favorites!I had zero complaints. Even the ending only made me pine for more. And Spot, that seemingly weak villain... yeah, even he got more awesome as the movie progressed. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man collection and it has supplanted many of the existing Spider-Man movies.","8/10"
"view_and_review","16 July 2017","If the Planet of the Apes franchise ends with this installment then it will rank as one of the top trilogies all time. Now, that's both: not saying much and saying a lot. It's not saying much because there are only a handful of good trilogies. But it's saying a lot because there are so many abysmal trilogies, so the odds were incredibly against this series being even halfway decent.If Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't establish the apes as intelligent sovereign creatures with no other desire than to be left alone, The War for the Planet of the Apes did. We were given a deeper and longer look inside of their lives as this movie spent more time giving us the apes than the first two.The lead primate, Caesar, finds his community under attack again. He is faced with the choices of flee to a more remote location or take the fight to the humans. It's not an easy choice to be certain because those that they are up against now are trained soldiers.The movie goes far beyond that though. It is a layered story with several portentous moments. Regardless of whether you're an ardent animal hater or merely indifferent to the plight of lesser creatures, this movie will give you pause over the conflict between the apes and the humans.War for the Planet of the Apes is excellent and it only enhances what came before it.","3/10"
"view_and_review","20 January 2022","It could be said that ""Life of Pi"" is a combination of ""Cast Away"" and ""Open Water."" I would stay away from such a simplistic equation especially since pi is in the title of the aforementioned movie. ""Life of Pi"" is so much more than ""Cast Away"" in ""Open Water,"" it has its own identity, its own essence which makes it uniquely different from the other two, and not just because of the tiger.Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan) had a fantastical story. He and his family were caught on a sinking ship in the middle of the Pacific while traveling from India to Canada. Everyone on the ship died except Pi who made it to a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger. In short order it was just Pi and the tiger battling the elements and battling each other for survival, while also battling each other for supremacy.This was a dramatic movie with a set as colorful as the main character. Visually, this movie is stunning and it keeps the viewer engaged. You'll feel like you've experienced a lifetime of drama though Pi was in the open sea far less than that.Ang Lee lost me after ""Hulk"" and I didn't watch another movie of his until ""Gemini Man"" which was simply OK. I don't see myself jumping on the Ang Lee train because of ""Life of Pi,"" but it is at least a little redemptive.","10/10"
"viithtrump","26 May 2018","Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.","1/10"

"vinniec-53536","22 February 2023","In Marvel Studios' 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', our favorite pint-sized (and occasionally giant-sized) hero Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and co. Are sucked into, and subsequently trapped in, the otherworldly Quantum Realm. There, Scott is forced to make a deal with the Devil, or in this case the dictatorial Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), the only one with the means to get them home. As the title suggests, the majority of the movie takes place in this subatomic universe, which doesn't look half-bad, considering it's basically a fully-CG environment. It is home to some unique creatures and residents, who have fairly minimal roles and are ultimately kinda forgettable, though the one named Veb was hilarious. The movie wastes no time getting the plot in motion, as we're off into the Quantum Realm within the first 10 minutes, and it's pretty well-paced overall. As far as the cast, everyone does a solid job. Paul Rudd is delightful as usual, and Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet van Dyne gets some time to shine in a larger role than expected. Newcomer Kathryn Newton portrays Scott's now-teenaged daughter Cassie, and while it was cool seeing her suit-up alongside her dad, she comes off as a bit unbelievable at times. However, it's Jonathan Majors' Kang who steals the show. He's menacing, intimidating, and has a calm-yet-confident demeanor. I've always loved characters who know how much of a threat they are, like Darth Vader, and Kang definitely fits into that category. I truly cannot wait to see more of him in future MCU projects. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention MODOK, the most perfectly goofy and ridiculous character I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in a movie. Overall, 'Quantumania' is much bigger in scale than the previous films in the 'Ant-Man' series, but still retains most of the humor and heart that they've become known for. In fact, I personally like it better than the last installment, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'. It's a fun, extremely comic book-y (in a good way) family adventure through an intriguing sci-fi world, and I definitely had a good time watching.","1/10"
"vinniec-53536","6 June 2023","In 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse', the follow-up to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse', we catch up with Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he tries his best to juggle his responsibilities as a student and son alongside his role as Brooklyn's one-and-only Spider-Man. However, when a new villain called The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) emerges and fellow spider-powered hero Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) unexpectedly returns, our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler embarks on an adventure that takes him way out of his neighborhood. In the same vein as such classic sequels as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight', 'Across the Spider-Verse' tells a darker, more mature story than its predecessor, while still retaining much of the heart and humor that made it so beloved. While the film contains quite a few pretty heavy moments, there are also some wholesome, endearing ones as well, creating a nice balance. Revelations are revealed that give more depth to Miles and Gwen, and we see them make tough decisions that perfectly reflect who they are as characters. Some intriguing new players are introduced as well, such as the anti-establishment Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) and the no-nonsense Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac), that add additional layers and perspectives to the story. The latter in particular creates a unique dilemma for Miles that no 15-year-old should have to face. The film also does a terrific job of taking a villain who starts out as an unintimidating joke and turns him into a terrifying threat by the end. While Miles himself is always a delight to watch, Gwen stole the show for me this time. She has a much bigger role than she did in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and takes her well-deserved place in the spotlight alongside Miles as essentially co-lead. With all that said, the film's biggest strength is absolutely its revolutionary visuals. 'Across the Spider-Verse' brilliantly blends multiple animation styles into a dazzling four-course feast for the eyeballs, so much so that as I went to sleep that night I was still trying to process everything I'd seen. From the beautiful environments to the mind-blowing action sequences to the characters themselves, every single shot in this movie is downright entrancing. In conclusion, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's a true masterpiece of comic-book movies, of animation, and of filmmaking in general. The bar has been raised. Other studios, take notes: this is how it's done.","10/10"
"vipin88","22 November 2012","The symbolism of PI a mathematical annotation to irrational numbers has perhaps not been captured so beautifully ever in cinema !! Those who know India and have had the experience of spending even a few days in this enigma of a country know how confusing yet subtly philosophic this country is ...and this is exactly what the cinematic masterpiece from Ang Lee portrays ......To discover who you really are , you need to be thrown in a situation which tests your limits and then ""wisdom"" will be given to thee. I have not read the novel so i did not actually know what its all about when I walked into the theater and was pleasantly surprised at so many insinuations & portrayals of the Indian way of thinking of universal brotherhood. Ang Lee keeps the things in a different realm of reality which we all acknowledge does exist but perhaps are afraid to ""test the waters"" since we as human beings are conformists by nature and can not leave our ""comfort zone"" to think things in a way they should be thought of .......this is exactly why the director succeeds in drawing our attention to small but significant things which need to be understood to make the path more worthy of further discovery......Truly world class cinema with great acting and I will not hesitate in adding that the ""tiger"" who plays Richard Parker does deserve an Oscar this season .........","7/10"
"virindra","18 December 2012","I went to Life of Pi special event in our local cinema and the movie was sold out on two screens. I have never seen this before. The movie is about religion and a cast away. The movie is very funny, frightening, serious, dramatic, beautiful, breathtaking, intelligent at the same time. The story behind the story is fantastic. Acting is wonderful. I am glad Irrfhan Khan has put a step out of Bollywood. I loved his movies even when he was not yet a Bollywood star. He had a small part in this movie, but fulfilled that very well.Suraj Sharma is a newcomer and an underdog when it come to acting. He did very well for a first time. This cannot be said about most beginning actors or actresses. I hope he will make more movies (as an actor or director) who have a deeper meaning like Life of Pi. I don't hope for this boy to follow the footsteps of Dev Patel who acted in this wonderful Slumdog Millionair and then in this boring Aribender.Like the beauty of Shravanthi Sainath was breathtaking, so were the scenes of the animals in this movie. I can say it was fantastic. I can imagine that this movie will not make it in India, because it has a heavy take out when it comes to religion. Even in the West the gravity of the real story might for most people be to hard to follow and understand. But for those who can keep their mind to a movie, it is worth watching in the cinema and more times after when it gets out on DVD.","8/10"
"viruz1983","1 February 2024","I'm sure Jason was having all the fun he could while saying all that stupid bee dialogs with a stone cold face :) but that's the fun of this movie, it's like a modern version of Commando with Schwartz:
""Matrix, what have you left for us? Bodies.""But all the scenes without Jason, and first of all - the whole line with the FBI agent - complete garbage, she is pointless, pathetic, boring, and stupid dialogues in her performance - sound really stupid. Cut her character out of the plot - nothing would change, she doesn't participate in its development at all.Bottom line, if you somewhere near 40, Sly and Arny were your idols in childhood, and muscular men with a minimum of dialog, but a huge charisma warm your heart - it's safe to watch, especially skipping characters - fillers.","9/10"
"vishalmellark","4 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse strikes the perfect chord, like a symphony of web-slinging hilarity. It swings through the cinematic landscape with impeccable pacing, juggling character development and action like a circus performer on caffeine. The voice acting is A-grade, with Isaac brooding so intensely that I could swear his voice could rival thunder. Hailee Steinfeld shines as Gwen, blending her previous roles into a cocktail of awesomeness. And let's not forget Moore, who's simply ""freaking amazing"" as Morales, showcasing maturity and immaturity in a way that would make even a hormonal spider proud. The storytelling is as fresh as a spider web spun by a hipster arachnid, blending nostalgia, comedy, and superheroism in a way that leaves you saying, ""Wow, superheroes can be deep and funny!"" The comedy is a riot, hitting you with more punchlines than a spider web has sticky threads, and the nostalgia and Easter eggs are like a treasure hunt for cinephiles and comic book aficionados. The action scenes are a step up from the first film, delivering more kicks, flips, and whips than a salsa dancing Spider-Man. The animation and art style are a visual feast, like watching a kaleidoscope of comic book pages come to life in a mind-bending acid trip. Sure, there are a few hiccups along the way, like some forced humor and moments of pacing hiccups, but hey, nobody's perfect, not even Spider-Man. The ending may drag on a bit, like that one friend who can't take a hint to leave the party, but it's still a wild ride that'll make you want to spin back for more. So grab your popcorn, slip into your Spidey suit, and get ready for an adventure that'll make you laugh, cheer, and leave you itching for the next installment. Spider-fans, this one's for you!","8/10"
"vishwatej286","1 July 2023","Indiana Jones Character is one of the Iconic Character ever made in the History. Harrison Ford played the character for over 4 Decade. And he still has fantastic screen presence at his 80's age. This is the 1st time James Mangold has directed an Indiana Jones movie. Previous Indiana Jones were made Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Although James has directed for the first time, He still did a great job in Direction.This movie can't be compared with with 'Raiders' and the 'Last Crusade'. As per my point of view, Those two movies were masterpiece. But still 'Dial of Destiny' stands as its own because the story take place in Later age of Prof. Indiana Jones with changes in culture and Technology and his age. This is the first Indiana Jones movie which is longer in story line, locations where the story takes place and more action than any previous Indiana Jones movie ever made. This is the last movie that John Williams ever composed music.There are Few drawbacks;
(1) You will miss Spielberg direction Style and Action sequence.(2) In the Climax sequence the story gets little carried away.(3) Few actors makes Cameo but very less impact in the story.Phoebe Waller Bridge is the new entry as character in Indiana Jones movie. And she really pulls off the character. Mads Mikkelsen as always f*ing great. He can act any character without agitation.Overall ""Dial of Destiny"" is a very well made action Adventure movie as per Indiana Jones franchise.It Deserves 8/10.","6/10"
"vithiet","20 August 2023","I absolutely love the first one and the fact I know so many people who are not into animated movies or comics who also found it great is a testament to its quality. So I went in this second chapter optimistically hoping they wouldn't mess up trying to emulate the first one; I certainly didn't think it would be equally good. And to my utmost surprise it's actually... better. It surpasses it in every way: the visuals of course but also the depth of the story and the writing that goes along, voice acting of course, terrific score, and just overall directing. 2.5 hours just went like that *snaps fingers* and since I didn't know it was planned to be a trilogy I let out a very loud ""Noooooo!"" when the words To Be Continued appeared as it felt like I was only 30 minutes in. If Beyond the Spider-verse ends up being as good (or dare I say it... better?) this will go down as one of the most perfect and impressive trilogies ever made. Oh yeah, highly recommended, in case that wasn't clear haha.","10/10"
"vithiet","22 October 2023","I was VERY skeptical for so, so many reasons: the previous installment, Harrison Ford's age, early screenings with bad reviews, etc. So I went in cautiously optimistic.... and i think that was the right approach. I didn't expect to be wowed and didn't not fear being disappointed. And I got a pretty solid conclusion to the Indiana Jones saga as a result. Is it the best of the series? No, nothing will ever beat the third one. But it's also leaps and bounds from the previous one and I am now very glad they made Dial of Destiny to redeem themselves and end the franchise well. I get that some elements are a bit questionable but all in all, I would still recommend for a last fun ride with Indy.","7/10"
"vithiet","28 April 2023","As many others have pointed out we are now far from the heydays of peak MCU movies and this is just another reminder of that. The story is not horrible but nothing memorable. The actors are all good at what they do but the characters are uninspiring. The action and special effects still display the usual MCU level of polish but are not necessarily exciting. A better film critic than me could probably point out exactly what was the ""magic"" those movies had up until Endgame that is now completely lost. So as a fine piece of entertainment Quantumania does the trick but don't expect anything more than that.","4/10"

"Vivekmaru45","11 August 2023","A simple Spider-Man cartoon. Can't you just make a simple Spider-man cartoon like the ones we saw during Stan Lee's early career. I'm talking about the 1967-1981. The 1981 Spider-Man cartoons were the best: a bridge between the old and new.Then we had the relatively good 1990 Spider-Man animated series. What I've just listed are the best along with the live action first three Spider-Man movies starring Nicholas Hammond: Spider-Man 1977, Spider-Man Strikes Back 1978 and Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge 1981. Tears fall from my eyes as I recollect watching Spider-Man 1977 shown to us by our teacher in playschool. I was a little nipper but the Spider-Man character stuck in my memory and later reinforced by the 1981 cartoons I used to see in the afternoon after school.How people forget Nicholas Hammond was the first and best actor to play Spider-Man. Like John Wesley Shipp who played The Flash in the 1990 series. Truth is that the film industry wants you to forget these people ever existed. It is quite a shame that John Wesley Shipp who looks strikingly like Bruce Campbell never rose to fame. Indeed I would have like these two to star alongside each other in a Sam Raimi directed movie.Plot of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman across the multiverse where he meets a team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara/ Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.Verdict: just watched about 30 minutes and couldn't handle any more of it. Ironically I thought the previous installment made in 2018 was a much coherent plot and worth watching. Also I'm a staunch supporter of the original 1967 Peter Parker character created by Stan Lee who was a newspaper photographer. So why change???","10/10"
"Vivekmaru45","20 October 2017","This is the sequel to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), and follows events from the previous film.The theme of the film is liberation. If you think about it, the story is so common with The Ten Commandments directed by Cecil B. DeMille. So in this film, the chimpanzee Caesar plays the role that Moses played.Also, a thing you must ask yourself, is why they chose to name the chimpanzee Caesar. Caesar is actually derived from Julius Caesar who was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.He was later brutally assassinated. I recommend you to watch Julius Caesar (1970 film) which I think is the best adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, but I warn you the assassination scene depicted in the film is very graphic and disturbing. Back to this film: Two years after the U.S. military was called to fight off an increasingly intelligent and dangerous tribe of apes, starting a devastating war between the two species, the apes' clan, led by the chimpanzee Caesar, are attacked in the woods by a rogue paramilitary faction known as Alpha-Omega, led by a mysterious Colonel. Alpha-Omega has in its service apes (called ""donkeys"") that had previously followed Koba, a maniacal, human-hating bonobo who led a failed coup against Caesar and started the war after leading a vengeful attack against human survivors in San Francisco.Verdict: the theme of the film as I have mentioned earlier is liberation. Caesar's character suffers a lot from persecution, by both his own kind and humans. Woody Harrelson gives the same performance Marlon Brando did in Apocalypse Now(1979). Similarly, Harrelson's character is the same as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. I was not impressed by the direction, script, photography and background sound-effects. Since this film deals largely with CGI graphics, the human casting seems irrelevant to discuss. Woody Harrelson is the only good actor who has gained fame with films like: Indecent Proposal(1993), Natural Born Killers(1994), Money Train(1995), The People vs. Larry Flynt(1996), Play It to the Bone(1999) and No Country for Old Men(2007).I was not impressed with Matt Reeves direction. He has made a film even worse than his earlier one. His best film for me remains Let Me In(2010), an American-British adaptation of the of the Swedish film Let the Right One In(2008).","7/10"
"Vivekmaru45","30 April 2023","Not as good as the first installment though. I thought the first half was boring. The second half picked up the pace though and made it half-enjoyable.I'm not a Paul Rudd fan and not a Ben Affleck one too. I think both these dudes look the same. It was good to see Michelle Pfeiffer again(Batman Returns, Into The Night). My favorite actor Bill Murray(Ghostbusters, Groundhog day) has aged badly though. Michael Douglas(Black Rain, Jewel Of The Nile, The Star Chamber, The War Of The Roses, The Ghost And The Darkness, Falling Down) still looks good. It was great to see all these legends together one last time.Okay about the movie. The special-effects are saturated with CGI same like the Shazam sequel. The story deals with Janet van Dyne(Pym's wife) being trapped in the Quantum realm. The rest of the plot deals with a device that can make entry into the Quantum realm and thereby rescue Janet.Verdict: just about enjoyable for a one-time viewing. And movies like these are meant to be watched in a cinema to experience the best sound and visuals.","4/10"
"vjlatus","17 December 2023","Okay, so the ending was not very satisfying for me, and there was a little too much reminiscence with the younger Indie for my liking. I felt that the sound mix was badly balanced with the dialogue far too quiet and the music too loud, so I found the dialogue hard to follow. I saw Antonio Banderas on the credits, but didn't even notice him in the film, so whatever scene(s) he had were just not memorable. I didn't like the thieving goddaughter character, her ""jokes"" were not funny, and her short round replacement was contrived, and didn't have the same charm that the original had. But that said, it was a reasonable romp through classic Indiana Jones territory, and a decent enough story.","6/10"
"vjqpjyy","16 June 2022","I just watched this movie again after like 5 years and it's probably my favourite movie of all time. The movies message was very powerful and almost made me cry don't forget about the immaculate cinematography.","7/10"
"VOIIIXI","2 February 2024","The issues with this movie are pretty obvious really, we've seen it all before in similar generic dumb action movies. The tireless constant exposition throughout the movie, the cringy dialogue, the over the top plot and characters, the ""secret government controls the world and they're also very bad"" thing, the constant dramatic music over every scene, the bad guy taking a long time to shoot or doesn't and then something happens, the fight scenes where there are 10 or 20 people around him but they decide to attack one at a time, and of course none of them can pull their gun fast enough or have it ready, and either not shoot or if they shoot they won't hit him of course, just all the stupid crap that we've seen before, uninspired unimaginative director doing the same things to make some money. Not surprised coming from the director of the Oscar winning critically acclaimed movie ""SUICIDE SQUAD"" hahahaha.One of my biggest issues with the movie is how throughout the whole movie until the last 10 minutes, that female cop wants to catch Jason Statham's character so badly, who's avenging her mother who got scammed and committed suicide because of it, and destroying call centers that harm thousands and millions of other people, why is she so mad that he's doing what he's doing, it's very odd, and it makes me despise that character so badly. Oh yeah ""she took an oath"" like stfu.All she did was make dumb jokes with her unfunny partner literally hours and days after her mother died, she's handled her mother's death as if her goldfish died. And she's always dressed like she's going to a night club or going to the mall with her friends, not like an FBI agent. There's a scene where she was literally walking around with a Harvard t-shirt, a police jacket and ripped pants. Another scene she's wearing this suit, but instead of a tie, there's this big stupid button/necklace that has a woman's painting or picture on it, and also wearing capri pants and big black boots. She is always dressed inappropriately in every scene, like she wants to look like a cool and quirky FBI agent so badly, this doesn't make her cool, just very obnoxious and unprofessional looking. Terrible character, and the actress is also terribly miscast for that terrible role. No personality or charisma at all.The positives of the movie are of course Jason Statham, he's one of the best in the business and extremely charismatic, and this goes without saying, it's the reason why me and everyone else wanted to watch this movie. I would watch him in anything, and they really should cast him in more and better roles. That's about all the positives about it. I mainly wanted to write this review to share my hatred towards that female cop character.","10/10"

"wadjet-79-52782","5 September 2019","Best story so far but unfortunatly only in the first third of the movie. Then it becomes just a typical fight for the rest of the movie. Luckily the fighting was the coolest i have seen from dragon ball. really epic fight animations. absolutely beautiful. But it was never that serious and the story never continued during the fighting. they just got the fighting over with and then had a mini ending. Thats why i only rate it 8 stars. I wish while they were fighting the story actually continued and was like a drama movie or something. but it was like okay the story got us to the fight scene, now we will have a couple epic fights but then the movie is basically over. the end characters including freeza and vegeta, didnt match the the story telling of those characters in the first 3rd of the movie. In the end freeza didnt even fight for real and was used like a side guy like yamcha. Maybe he is a side guy, but he doesnt know it! He should have been a little more angry or promising goku that he would get vengeance when he gets stronger or something. In the end he kind of like had this ""its cool, im a side character"" kind of vibe to him. maybe the movie needed 30 more min.","6/10"
"wagamarcin","14 February 2021","First and foremost I'm a big Dragon Ball fan. It went through my childhood, teenage age and now it goes and make impact on my adulthood. I really love the idea of making a canonical movie that fits with original storyline and prolongs happenings of DB Super serie.Broly was created firstly in Dragon Ball movie 7: Legendary Super Saiyan. Comparing to contemporary Broly, the elder one had origin that was insulting our DB hearts and emotions. The dumbest reason of involving a villain i have ever met. A guy who was furious with Goku because Goku cried out loud and didn't allow to sleep Broly peacefully. Laziness in its all entirety.
Our more funky Broly perhaps hasn't great and mind-blowing roots and is simple in its simplicity but when you rewrite character you need to place some interesting stuff. Like e.g his friendship with furry monster. His madness is also quite good explain with father who leeches Broly to fulfill ambitions to rule whole galaxy.Another step are fighting scenes. Very good looking but some CGI interrupts when you're not familiar with it as a DB fan. Honestly I love final stage of power tournament in DB Super because it's great drawn, dynamic and without CGI what is kinda artificial for me. Maybe I'm too demanding and it was just a little scratch on a awesome surface.What about our main blokes? I'm proud that Vegeta is well presented here with all of his esteem and proud. I boast the way that he isn't guy who Brolly pummels and makes a train bag out of him. Vegeta plays similar part as Goku and it is hell of a satisfying. Frankly, Goku struggles more in this movie. And a solution to defeat Broly by making a fusion shows Broly huge potential but also his limits. Gogeta plays with him with confidence at the last part of a fight. Canonically Gogeta is shown for the first time. And they nailed it. Everyone waited for that moment and should be happy.Ok, maybe this review is a mess but I've watched that film 15 min ago and it left me with great emotions and I'm impressed. The best DB movie and there is nothing to argue about.
My rate 8 out of 10.","8/10"
"walentys","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","5/10"
"wall_o","5 May 2019","First of all I gave this movie a 10 because I want to hype it a bit because it still should serve as a very good example for any superhero movie or blockbuster in general. But if I was honest with myself I would give it an 8.Let me explain why and before we proceed here comes the necessary
SPOILER ALERT!!So why did Endgame leave me with a bittersweet taste?
First, because I loved Infinity war very very much. What I loved then was the fact that the story wasn't the usual Manichean hero story with a fight between good and evil. I read the message of Infinity war as an understanding of morality being more subjective than absolute. And I believe that our concepts or ethics and morality in the modern society are often biased and uneducated because we refuse to see what lies beyond the scope of our little self-centered lives.Wherever you root for Thanos or not, believes he is a horrendous monster or a misunderstood hero doesn't matter in the end. But I believe a story must be honest to its core and should be an opportunity to show us what we don't want to see. A truth that is not as radical as what our reason can bear.And in that sense, Infinity war did a great job by giving an honest ending. Every character has lost the people they loved, even Thanos. But we had the sense that despite this horrible event, the future of the universe was still hopeful like Thanos predicted.And that's where Endgame faulted primarily in my opinion. They depict the 5 years later on Earth like a depressed desolated world. And I strongly believed that this is an utterly dishonest and unrealistic version of what it would be. If 50% of the human race would be wiped out in the real world. Of course we would be shocked, traumatized. There would be grief, there would be despair. But whether you like it or not, it is something most people would be able to overcome. And especially after 5 years, humanity would definitely have been able to move on. A lot of people would have been able to support each other because many would share the same grief. Then some people would even have thrived and find opportunity in this chaotic situation turning things around and finding ways to make their country or their world great again. I'm sorry for being cynical but if some people would lose loved ones, some would likely also loose enemies or people who used to be a burden or a competition.In the end, the survival instinct and/or pursuit of happiness are strong motivators and would definitely prevail at least for a lot of people or at least for enough people so that these ones start inspiring the others. And yeah I think 5 years is enough time to see the ""benefits"" of this massive shared drama.So if Endgame had been honest with this context and had put its characters in a new prosperous world, we could have seen some heroes being even more conflicted. The avengers would have had a harder time moving on than anybody else because they lost. It was their role, their responsibility to protect mankind and they failed. But by seeing that the world is a happier place, that the other people moved on with their lives and that a lot of problems like climate change and such have recessed, it would be harder for them to act when they hear the eventuality of a solution to fix what happened. Like we see with Tony Stark, who has his family, his daughter and a happy quiet life.I believe it was a missed opportunity to not use this extremely logic yet clever conflict between being human and being a hero and use it more throughout the story.And also not completely demonizing Thanos who was a more layered and complex character in Infinity war.But yeah especially for Iron man/Tony Stark, if we had seen him struggling more, being more in conflict of doing the hard choice, hesitating being a hero or being a dad, and if the consequences of Thanos's snap wasn't shown just as gloomy and dark but if there was actually a bit of silver lining to it, that maybe he wasn't completely wrong about the balancing of the universe, I think it would have been even more interesting.I believe that the more human a hero is, the harder it is to act heroically for him, the more his heroic action will transcend.For me Endgame succeeded at 60% to achieve the climax I was hoping which is why I had this bittersweet feeling at the end.Still is a great movie. So I'm sure I will appreciate it more and more as I leave my expectations behind.PS: There were some great performances from the cast especially when they were playing with non-big professional actors, like the girl playing Morgan or the kids asking for a selfie at the diner, or with the director Joe Russo at the meeting. It felt casual and natural in a very good way. That was brilliant.","6/10"

"waltermwilliams","16 February 2023","Why wait for the next instalment of Star Wars episodes when Marvel totally riff on George Lucas imagination in the latest instalment of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", even down to the bar scene.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily respectively as Ant-Man and the Wasp are back for the first time since 2018 in a solo story.This time they are taking the whole family on a teddy bears picnic into the Quantum Realm to deal with the time travelling terror of Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors from ""Lovecraft Country"") and his old mate Darren the Dick (Corey Stoll).So let's turn off our regulators, keep our helmets on and get ready to hear the words Pim Particles and Multiverse thrown around...a lot!Kang of course doesn't walk the time line like the rest of us...he just doesn't do linear.However, he does understand ""variants"" better than Sam Raimi.If you remember ""Honey I Shrunk The Kids"" or any of those corny ""Journey"" movies in the 70's you'll be partly prepared for what you are about to witness.This movie is very trippy and Sci-Fi.It's as if the writer, Jeff Loveness, was testing out illegal substances for a Government funded drug experiment.Watch out for: A wonderful cameo from an Oscar nominated actor making his third comic book role.Plus Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer looking great in her 60's) will air some dirty laundry and dark secrets.In this movie Ant-Man doesn't have to win his battle with Kang.They both just have to lose.It's such a shame to see an Oscar winning actor like Michael Douglas spend most of his time with his hands submerged in a bowl of jelly.This Father-Daughter flick could have easily been a 4 star film for the 31st movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it needed a little less conversation and a little more action please (as Elvis once told me).Stay for the final credits to get a clue as to what's coming in Phase 5 for the Avengers and how it will have a profound impact on the MCU.","1/10"
"warren-87235","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","10/10"
"waywarddrifters","30 June 2023","At this point I'm convinced that these corporatists at Disney are deliberately out to destroy every last film franchise that had any spirit within it over the last 45 years or so. How this film gets such praise is beyond me.I saw ""Raiders"" on home video just before ""Temple of Doom"" hit theaters as a boy. It became my favorite action / adventure film of all time, and rivals""Jaws"" as my favorite film of all time. I also loved the first two sequels. However, like most die-hard fans, I can't stand ""Crystal Skull,"" and walked into this film on opening night nervous, but objectively hoping they'd give my childhood cinematic hero the proper send-off. If by proper, had I meant modern, where you can't let a man be competent, strong, and daring, then I guess it fits. But the movie is a dumpster fire.""The Dial of Destiny"" is beyond stale. The horrid green screen effects, the CGI, and the ever-condescending Phoebe Waller-Bridge ruin this film completely. You could have cameoed every notable character from the preceding films, and it still wouldn't save this doomed opus.You want this film summed up bluntly? Take the scene in ""South Park"" where George and Stephen corner Indiana Jones and have their way with him, and multiply it by the tenth power, and you have this mindless, heartless, cash-grab of a film.I adore Harrison Ford, and gave a star for him doing the best he could with a dead-on-arrival script, and I gave a star for Mads Mikkelsen's performance - which was as great as it was underwritten. But that's it. Literally everything else about this movie was them relieving themselves on a cinematic icon - in front of the world.The worst aspect of this film is that it is so poorly written that multiple characters deviate from their established character traits, and say / do things that seem - well - out of character for them. The writing is nothing short of mindless and lazy.Comparable to the bad writing are the rushed and poorly executed special FX. The action scenes in this film make Shia Leboeuf doing his Tarzan impression in ""Crystal Skull"" look like a welcome cinematic escape. Minus the original ""Jurassic Park,"" and ""T2,"" I've never been much for CGI, but this film really nukes the fridge! (Ha!) Some of the FX were so bad that they felt like a jab at the audience. Then there's the ""modern audience"" pandering. I'll spare you. Just know that this film is everything that is wrong with movies in this day and age.The good news is that I doubt Disney can make anywhere near their money back on the steaming dump they took on an icon. And I hope they lose so much money that the only place you can find their logo here soon is in a museum. To do this to a character like Indiana Jones in an effort to keep their ESG score up, and keep the blue-haired mob from threatening them, is a sad, disrespectful end to a largely amazing franchise.It's fitting. Cinema is as dead as critical thought, and our icons now perish in fires built by madmen.As Belloq put it in ""Raiders,""

"Web_Of_Doom","18 June 2023","Only worth watching once, as far too many Directorial & script errors.It starts out OK-ish but gradually it becomes more & more disjointed.Peyton Reed the Director was another poor choice by Disney to have direct this film as he was unable to bring the poor script together, as so many times scenes needed a more believable reaction from all of the characters in the film. However instead it was a series of incidents where very rarely did the characters react to their environment in a way that any normal human would, as this really takes you out of the film.Jeff Loveness the script writer chosen by Disney executives ( yet another jump on the bandwagon Rick & Morty TV series writer who just joined a successful TV show after it had already become successful ) clearly has no clue how to write for a big budget super hero movie.Why does the Disney executives keep picking the wrong people to direct & write scripts? ( it is like they actually want Marvel to fail ).Stan Lee & Larry Lieber wrote these characters not for children, but as real life characters that had super hero abilities thrust upon them but for some reason Disney think of these characters as ""childish"" so they hire people they think will write for ""children"". When will they realise not only do adults not want to watch movies written specifically for a child but guess what children are not dumb either & they understand a lot more than adults ( such as Disney executives ) give them credit for.Everyone ( children + adults ) want scripts that start of with intrigue, then through a series of events where people act in a logical & more importantly believable way get you to the pay off at the end of the film.The journey should be its own reward, because of what you learn.In this film you learn absolutely nothing of value, as it is pointless.The most important part of any film generally are the story arcs & also the character arcs where the characters actually learn & grow from their experiences along with the audience watching ( whether that be moral lessons or just learning more about the Marvel universe IN A BELIEVABLE WAY for future film interest, however Disney executives choose the wrong directors & even worse the wrong writers so have absolutely destroyed phase 4 as character arcs make little sense ).THIS ANT MAN 3 FILM ( A. M. A. T. W. Q. ) simply needs to be forgotten about as I feel so bad for the actor Jonathan Majors whose character is Kang the Conqueror, as this should have been his huge blockbuster hit. I think he makes a really good Kang & has potential as phase 4 needs to be written off mostly however keep the actors who deserve it. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas & Michelle Pfeiffer are all huge stars ( who have proved many times they are fantastic actors ) so please Disney give them Directors & script writers they deserve who actually understand how a story should develop.The most important thing about any film is the story makes sense, then the story has to be interesting & hopefully it will also give you insight. You let the audience decide what they take from the film themselves.Each character has to act & react to each scene in a believable way or there needs to be dialogue ( or action ) that makes sense to make each scene potentially believable to maintain the audience suspension of disbelief, as they the audience will ride with you & the story telling so long as the writer & director can keep the story in the realms of truth.There was far too many scenes in this poor film where characters did not act in a way which as an audience member you would expect them to do so. This completely takes the audience out of the film & ruins the experience for them, as you can't believe in what you are watching.Kathryn Newton is a young actress with potential who's character Cassie Lang obviously has flaws thinking for example it is OK to go beyond peaceful protesting against the police ( doing their job & following the law ) by moving homeless people on from their choice of living illegally. As it is good the young character wants to live in a better world however harassing the police is not fair as they were doing their job so where is the character arc showing this character progression in this film ( it sends out the wrong message about how to protest as it is not the police's fault & they do not deserve their property vandalised ). At the end of the film Cassie Lang should have realised the police was not in the wrong ( for following the law ) & she should have apologised to the police officers after realising her initial views where far too simplistic & very young child-like ( naive ) in blaming them, as actually homelessness is a much more complex issue & the law keepers actually need better laws to uphold that would help the homeless. Thus she used her power against the wrong people so should learn from that as then we would see her character progression & becoming maturer.Cassie Lang could have made amends & learnt from her immaturity.However unfortunately the script writer was obviously too immature & thinks it is cool to blame the police ( which is not really helping anyone & in fact is putting negative messages out to the audience of this film ).Disney need to hire more intelligent, more mature & better script writers who actually have a social conscience & understand character arcs.( that was just one example where a character could have matured ).Another phase 4 Marvel I will not buy & will pretend was never made.The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the magnificent CGI ( + 1 star from base 1 star = 2 stars ) + ( another 1 star = 3 stars total for the great actors who did their best to save the film. As an awful director & dreadful screen writer ruined a big budget movie with lack of talent.MARVEL FILMS NEED TO BE WRITTEN FOR AN INTELLIGENT AUDIENCE ( as children & adults are mostly intelligent so they will search out the best films with the most intelligent scripts & after they see this Ant Man 3 film they will be put off future Disney productions ).Disney used to stand for quality storytelling, now it stands for lacklustre storytelling so it's time Disney fire the people responsible for hiring these dreadful directors & abysmal screen writers to rebuild Disney.","7/10"
"web-534-393830","6 July 2023","The destroyer of legacies has done it again - two and a half hours of a depressing hero and an almighty woman taking over. Sounds familiar? Terrible taste, terrible cgi, worst ideas for a movie ever produced... I don't understand why Harrison Ford accepted to destroy his own character by following Kathy Kennedy's clear plan to destroy the Western culture. 300 million dollars gone with one of the worst franchise bombs in cinema's history, again by her hand and corrupted team. Please support cinema by not watching this movie in any form. Kathy Kennedy will finally disappear from the cinematic world and movies will be great again. That day isn't today.","2/10"
"Weirdo-Magnet","8 May 2019","After seeing Infinity War i was so excited to see this movie. I must say i was rather disappointed. This movie was not awful, there are some really good scenes but there were so many things that annoyed me.
Thor - he was literally turned into a joke. Ruined his entire character and back story,.
Hulk - did he actually do anything? No! absolutely ruined his character. After being useless in the last movie i honestly thought he would redeem himself in this one. It does not happen.
Captain Marvel - Why create such a powerful character then miss her out of 90% of the movie? When she does finally appear i was expecting an epic fight scene between her and Thanos...... no! nothing. They literally have a little scuffle and that's the end of it. Then you don't see her again until the very end of the movie.
The time travel story made no sense - i can't even begin to type about that.you'll see if/when you watch. I will just say this - The Thanos the Avengers were fighting was based before all of the Avengers movies - which means after killing him, the first movies would never have happened. thats just one.
The first half of the movie was a little slow paced, i was thinking ""is something going to happen"". The end battle was good but it was WAY too short and there was so much going on that I couldn't concentrate on one thing. Plus i do not understand how Thanos was so powerful without the infinity stones.
The weapon Thor created in Infinity war was capable of killing Thanos but, for some reason Thor couldn't defeat him with not one, but 2 weapons. Speaking of weapons, I hated the fact that Captain America was able/worthy of wielding Thor's hammer - NO! its Thor's weapon. I felt like it took power away from the characters.
Like i said - not awful, but nowhere near as good as Infinity War (which i would rate a 9). I rated this movie a 6 because that's an average rating, and i think this movie is average.","2/10"
"welhof1","5 December 2021","This was just as you expected. High action with some light hearted comedy thrown in. The plot had me guessing a couple times. You just had to roll with it. The avengers all seemed weak in this film but that was expected with who they were up against. One heckuva cliffhanger at the end.","8/10"
"wendieta","20 February 2023","First of all, this movie is not perfect. It's definitely not one of the strongest MCU movies, but it's certainly not the worst. After being treated with poor phase 4 movies, this movie feels pretty good. It's much better than the likes of Eternals and Thor Love and Thunder. Majors is a good choice to play Kang, but I feel he wasnt given a very good script for this movie. MCU's biggest problem has always been the villains, and to some extent, it's the case here too. Kang is supposed to be an avenger-level villain, but it doesnt show it here. He has the presence and powers, which he shows when he threatens scott and cassie and freezes janet, but when it comes to the final battle, he doesnt use those powers. Instead he uses his energy beam thing, which I think is not as effective. He couldve destroyed the ants easily, but no. He even got his suit damaged by the ants. There are plenty to like about this movie though. Paul rudd is great as ever, and kathryn newton is refreshing. I like how she's not suddenly a strong and experienced fighter even though she has the suit. I do miss michael pena and TI, but I understand they wouldve been underused if included. Overall I think it's a solid, though not great, entry. I gave it a 7 because I found it entertaining enough, and that it marks the beginning of the Phase 5, which has potential.","7/10"

"wesleyarledge-86836","22 July 2023","Next to Spider-Man: No Way Home, Across the Spider-Verse takes the top spot as the best Spidey film I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing! It is incredible, a feast for the eyes, and full of humor and heart! There are so many Easter Eggs to spot throughout the movie, and it is so much fun to try to spot them, you never know what, or WHO might pop up in the story! 👀This ambitious sequel delves heavily into the Spider-Man mythos, and continues the story of Miles Morales Spider-Man from the Into the Spider-Verse film, but it adds more depth to some other characters that we fell in love with in the first film while introducing some other Spider-powered people. This time, they're on a mission to stop the destruction of the multiverse, by a madman known only as The Spot, who can portal in and out of the different universes within the Spider-Verse on a mission to destroy all Spiders! That's not all though, as the leader of the Spider team, Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) comes into conflict with Miles about his place in the Spider-Verse and what it truly means to be Spider-man!Featuring a massive voice cast including Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Jason Schwartzman, Karan Soni, Daniel Kaluuya, Oscar Isaac, Greta Lee, Mahershala Ali, Andy Samberg, Rachel Dratch, Zoe Kravitz, and many many, many more, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse does truly deliver! It's a sequel that does it's job even better than the first movie, times ten! Go see this movie even if you aren't a Spider-Man or superhero fan, it's an incredible spectacle!!And, the ending of the film is one of the most spectacular endings to a movie I've seen since Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame!","10/10"
"wesseldj-48581","5 August 2018","This movie was slow paced and tied together with improbable coincidences, like getting the soul stone, Thanos needed to sacrifice the one thing he loves, let it be that that thing was standing besides him, how convenient! Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end! The ending however is a cheap shot for a second installment.....","4/10"
"whatyalookinat","10 August 2023","From the opening scene I was sure the film's gonna be a masterpiece. An esthetically flawless picture with special animation style for each dimension. Especially Gwen's world, it was a definition of 'emotional', I still have goosebumps every time enjoying the scene. Also, the visuals were complemented by the soundtrack which made me wanna smile every time a song starts.Should I even mention all the references to not just the MCU, but other different things? I'm not sure if one can tell me the exact number of spiders that appeared. That's what Marvel does the best and it's the perfect film for such references.Overall, it was an unbelievable superhero picture with some interpersonal problems explored. I highly enjoyed the pacing of ATSV which wasn't boring at all. Looking forward to watching Beyond The Spiderverse. Not sure if it's gonna be EVEN better but my expectations are still high.","10/10"
"whheee","15 January 2024","If you're a producer in Hollywood and you want an action-packed film, the current writer of choice is Kurt Wimmer, whose film The Beekeeper just hit the big screen. With previous hits like Law Abiding Citizen and Expen4bles, Wimmer knows how to keep his story tight and his fight scenes explosive.And The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham, is no exception. Almost everyone in this film, male and female is a bad-ass.Built around the premise that the only thing that might be worse than beating a puppy is scamming a senior, Statham wreaks almost 2 hours of havoc on those who have fatally wronged the people he cares about, all while almost never breaking a sweat. Though in that time he does break many noses, fingers, and ankles.United Data Group are the big money-making scammers, overseen by Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons). What exactly does UDC do? Well, you know how you're always warned NOT to click on unknown links? They're the company that sends you the unknown weblinks and attachments, infecting and hijacking your computer and draining your bank accounts.The Beekeepers is the code name for the secret elite force within a secret government agency who even the secret keepers know little about. But what they do know scares the crap out of them; Adam Clay (Statham) was the best of the Bees, one who never fails to protect the Hive. When those in goverment positions put out the word, for their own financial reasons, that Beekeeper Clay has gone rogue, they send a number of legit and illegitimate armies to take him down and, more importantly, shut him up quickly.But they didn't realize that Clay, who only wanted to retire to his quiet life of beekeeping and honeycombs, is still the A-team Bee. In fact, he's the single member of this Bee team, dispatching multiple teams of nasty buzzing hornets left and right, smoking out the people who make their massive fortunes stealing other people's money.There are times when the script gets a little bit ""Wick-y"" in that other Bees are sent to take out this particular Bee, for a fee. Think ""High Table"" but definitely not as classy. Agents Verona Parker and Matt Wiley (Emmy Raver-Lampman and Bobby Naderi) are cast as the duo who are determined to smoke out Clay, but will Parker do her job or do right by her mother?Once Clay starts to follow the money trail, he's busy kicking the hornet's nest, one that has been skillfully hidden in the shadowy eaves of those at the highest level of power.","7/10"
"Whimsynsolence","27 November 2012","I watched the movie 'Life of Pi' today, it was fascinating. I was not able to think while the movie was playing because the incredible imagery continuously running in front of me, didn't provide me with the sufficient time to think. Yes, the book says that he was stranded in the sea for 277 days, well, the movie showed this extent of 277 days in less than 2 hours. Though, the story is fictional (yeahh! I know it says that this is based on a true story), so imagination has a greater scope. But, in the second attempt of his story, he implies that he was the tiger who ate the co-passengers in his life-boat, including his mother, the cook and whosoever he states were with them. Even in the first scene, where the hyena attacked the zebra and the orangutan, it angered Pi. Pi rose to attack it and suddenly, a Tiger catapulted itself to the open and attacked it. This may symbolize that the tiger in Pi rose to life at that moment. Well, remember what Pi's father had told him when for the first time he made an attempt to feed flesh to the tiger. Can't remember the quote word-to-word, but it did mention that you can see your emotions in the eyes of the tiger. Blah! The child (Pi, of course), who has digested 3 religions at once could also assimilate the very notion that 'the reflection-of-emotions' can be vice verse i.e., the tiger's emotions could reflect within him too (Read this line twice to make better sense of it).Next, it killed and ate the hyena first. As that was the time when he was experimenting with new meat, he tried the human flesh (as they were dead). Please note, 277 days! So, he ate his mother and then the cook (don't remember the other character he mentioned though). So here we see, that Pi became cannibalistic. Later on, he hunted fish and ate them for the next few days. I was not able to think all this when the movie was running because the scenes were running so fast, that, I hardly got the time to digest any of it. That is why Hollywood (I dono under what category this movie comes under) movies seem believable, because, it doesn't give you the time to think.The visit to the Carnivore Island was the best part of the movie for me, just for its sheer representation of multiple symbolism. One thing I noticed was that it characterized Lord Vishnu, who is sleeping in the ocean on Anantha (the poisonous snake). The very reason that the roots of the trees were entangled and looked as though it was crawling represented this very notion of the snake. The image over all, looked like a person sleeping - Lord Vishnu. It represented his form (the island) to be the life-giver in the morning (when the Lord must be sleeping), while at night, the island becomes acidic and kills all life forms on it, the Lord is asleep then, the poisonous snake feature is activated. So, this must be one of the crazy ideas behind this (and yes, I appreciate it). Well, heard a myth that the Tirumala hills which has the Tirupathi temple in its abode, which is in Andhra Pradesh, India. This temple has 7 hills surrounding it. Some amazing person found the shape of the hill to be the shape of the Tirupathi Venkateshwara's face. You can have a look at the picha (in the link below). The Carnivorous island has a similar concept as that of the pic of the hills. Well, there is a saying/belief that one day, all the wild (carnivorous) animals would come down this hill and attack humans. This will happen when the Lord would wake up. Don't worry it is a saying.The very reason Pi-fellow could come up with such a fascinating story is because, he has read 3 religious texts and understood the best way to narrate a thing that could sound realistic and yet exploit the reader/viewer's brain. This maybe the link with his interest with the religious text, and the dichotomy of being a cannibal.While watching the movie it made me feel that Pi is so heroic and he had survived it all. But, now I feel bitter for his act of cannibalism. His lies/truth... blah! it is a fiction. No need to ponder anymore. Well, I loved the movie and I will be watching it again. *giggles*","9/10"
"WhiteRau","4 January 2024","Good to see Jones back in the saddle. Pacing was a tad drawn out, making the sequences feel a unnecessarily tedious. The writers obviously didn't know how to write a building historical interest into the show, so it fell back to overly long 'action' scenes without meaningful ties to the point of it all along the way. The new female co-star is not very appealing to either look at or listen to. They tried to hard to make her 'edgy' and she wound up just a straight-up, plain b*tch. Worth a watch on your platform of choice despite it all because the show winda out to a pretty good ending, for which a grudging nod can be given.","7/10"

Three groups of people walked out on the film - I would have except we were in the center of the aisle. Too predictable, too hokey, way too juvenile. And the special effects were great for the monkey faces but amateurish for everything else. Oh, and plot holes galore (not that you'd look for a plot in a movie about talking monkeys). Oh, oh....AND Bad Ape can give Jar Jar Binks a run for his money for most irritating character in a movie series.","1/10"
"whoopwhoopywhop","20 January 2019","How many retcons are we going to have to see of Frieza wiping out the Sayians? It seems like anytime we try to go back and visit an earlier time period we end up with some sort of timeline inconsistency.This movie is plagued with established plot elements that just get ignored later on. The biggest ones I can recall are:Raditz somehow knowing that his parents sent Goku off to Earth. He was away on a mission and they had stated earlier that communication using the scouters is monitored so how exactly did he get that information?Broly turning super sayain. This one is so laughably bad. Broly's father explains that if broly gets too out of control he loses all sense of himself. After fighting in this state for quite some time Frieza decides to kill his father in order to trigger the emotional response that Goku had on Namek when Krillen died. The problem with that is, Broly is a mindless killing machine at this point, his father's death should have had no effect. Broly had shown more emotional attachment to a severed ear, than his father (who forced Broly to kill the only friend he had)
Personally I would have had Vegeta accidentally grab the ear in the middle of a fight, say something about how disgusting it is and have him blast it. That would have at least paid off the emotional character arc set up earlier in the story.Overall, the fight scenes are good, but the story lacks any substance. I'd wait for the eventual arc they'll do when more super episodes come out.","10/10"

"wienke-38620","26 April 2019","Amended after re-watching:
First the good:
1. Big fight scene was epic and was great to see everyone on screen at the same time . Amazing stuff.
2. Favorite part - Cap handles Thor's hammer. Just outstanding and emotional.
Ok, now the not so good:
1. Captain Marvel. Why they make the biggest and baddest superhero someone we haven't grown to love over the previous decade is baffling. And beyond that, Brie Larson is just unlikeable. But seriously, if she could take Thanos on head to head by herself and blow up his ship in seconds, why not let her wear the gauntlet? Lastly, going out of their way to let you know she's a lesbian was a bit much. You don't need a short haircut and ugly clothes just because you're gay. Plenty of attractive lesbians out there, but whatever. Brie butchers the role regardless.
2. Professor Hulk - did anyone like this adaptation? We've grown to love seeing Hulk smash and in both this and Infinity Wars, not one single fight scene with him smashing. Just sad.
3. Fat Thor - ok, fine, Chris Hemsworth can pull off the comedy really well, and I enjoy it when he does, but the whole movie we get the Big Lebowski? I would have much rather seen him back in shape magically from reconnecting with Mjolnir. In the end, he was still extremely awesome, so that was fine, but I just don't see the point of making him fat for the whole movie.
4. Time travel - is anyone besides me sick of every Sci-fi show using time travel to fix everything? If you're going to do it, at least take full advantage. We had the opportunity to see one on one fights with Thanos' Black Squad. How about Hulk going primal against the big guy (and even hurting Thanos some). Dr, Strange rematch with Ebony Maw, etc., etc. on the end, I think they could have cut some of the boring first hour and given us more action fight scenes that we've come to know Marvel for.In closing, the movie was still really good. I guess my expectations were just so high as they were closing out the phase that the changes with Hulk, Thor, and introduction of Captain Marvel just seemed misplaced and took away a lot of what I had come to love about the franchise. Still better than anything DC has managed to throw together.","8/10"
"wilbertwwest","24 June 2023","Wow! Spiderman Across the Spider-verse is soooo much better than I expected. I loved the focus on family, relationships, multiple cultures, throwbacks to other Spiderman movies, some unpredictable twists, action, and the varying types of animation. Most superhero movies seem to be heavy on action and weak on character relationships so it was refreshing to see this movie firmly deliver in this area. I was skeptical at the 9/10 IMDB rating but, I was wrong for that. Its a 10/10!!! I was traveling when it came out and was disappointed to see it pulled feom the IMAX and Dolby Cinema screens after the first weekend. I was lucky to find one cinema on June 23.","4/10"
"will-howlett","2 June 2023","I loved loads about this film, mainly the amazing action sequences and the sweet sweet fan service (one bit of fan service got a big loud oooooh from myself and most of the cinema).The problem I had with it is that despite it being a 2 parter so much of the emotional exposition was stretched out far longer than necessary through overlong dialogue. About an hour of the film is dedicated to ensuring we understand that Miles is a young man finding his path through life (I have no idea how some of the younger kids in the audience sat through it, they must have just been mesmerised by the flashy colours). It could have been handled in a much more condensed manner by better writers and still had the required impact. Given the film ends at a point that feels like a natural final third act it left me feeling shortchanged.If the overlong dialogue scenes had been condensed then I believe there would have been no need for the 2 parter. But then people wouldn't pay to see 2 films instead of 1.I expect when the initial mega fan reaction dies down and more ordinary filmgoers leave shocked at the ""to be continued"" message the IMDb score will dip dramatically.","10/10"
"willandcharlenebrown","1 July 2023","This Indiana Jones movie was spectacular!!! . Great acting from everyone as well as amazing cinematography and amazing musical scores. They did a great job of making it feel just like all of the other Indiana Jones, movies, and ranks up there with the best of them. Great to see them get back on track after the dismal Chrystal skulls movie! Ignore all of the haters in the reviews. There is nothing to dislike about this movie.

"williampsamuel","6 May 2020","You wouldn't expect pathos and deep personal drama from a movie about humans battling apes. In fact the trailers gave me the impression that this was where the series would go off the rails, replacing story and characters with explosions and effects. Thankfully I was very wrong. Beyond being an outstanding action blockbuster, War is a work of surprising complexity and depth, which successfully blends religious symbolism, painful imagery of slavery and genocide, and though provoking questions about the price of vengeance and what truly makes us human.For those who haven't seen the first two movies, it's been three years since conflict between the apes and the remnants of humanity began. In that time ape leader Caesar and his tribe have made every effort to avoid war, hiding ever deeper in the forests in the hope that they'll be left alone. In return they've been endlessly hounded by soldiers following the fanatical Colonel. Near the brink of destruction, Caesar decides the only hope for his beleaguered clan is to flee to a new land far away, while he deals with the Colonel once and for all. But of course the best laid plans of men and apes go astray, supping up a harrowing captivity and climactic final battle.Harrelson is in perfect form as the colonel, channeling Brando and adding his own natural insanity to create an antagonist very much like Col. Kurtz, only far more intense and aggressive. Personal loss and the fear of what humanity may become have driven him beyond the point of fanaticism, into utter ruthlessness and madness. He will use any means to achieve his ends; even killing his own men if he believes they pose a danger. His followers are as much a cult as an army, and he is like a prophet to them, preaching the gospel of salvation for humanity through the annihilation of the apes.Yet the Colonel is not the only flawed character in the movie. As Caesar continues on his quest, he's haunted by the memory of Koba, the villainous ape who started the war with humanity and died by Caesar's hand in the last film. Their clash came about because Caesar only wanted peace, while Koba was consumed by his thirst for revenge against the humans. But now as pursues his own vengeance, who must ask himself if he is becoming his old foe, and whether what he's doing is for the good of his tribe, or his own satisfaction.This question becomes more pressing as what was supposed to be a simple assassination becomes a rescue mission. Rather than kill all the apes immediately, the Colonel has imprisoned hundreds of them in what can only be described as a simian concentration camp where the captive apes are used a slave labor to build a wall that will complete the Colonel's defenses. The Holocaust imagery is striking and highly disquieting, especially in scenes where the captives are herded and beaten by fellow apes who are fighting for the humans. These ""Donkeys"" (presumably as in Kong) were followers of Koba, who fight for the promise that they will be spared, like Kapos in a Nazi concentration camp.These scenes are also unsettlingly similar to some from Roots and Twelve Years a Slave. It's a testament to the quality of the writing and direction that apes can be used as stand-ins for plantation slaves without it seeming even slightly racist. On the other hand the wall that the apes are building could be seen as an overly transparent political allegory, especially since it's at the border between two states. But then again it is a military fortification across the mouth of a box canyon; more like the wall at Helm's Deep than a monumental barrier to separate humans from apes. So make of it what you will.The apes meanwhile have their own human companion, a young mute girl they name Nova. Her presence is a fairly transparent ploy to make us relate to the protagonists, but it works, largely due to the young actress's wide facial acting range and sheer cuteness. And she may turn out to have more plot significance than we initially realize.Perhaps surprisingly for a movie this intense and frequently tragic, there is some excellent comedic relief, most of it delivered by Bad Ape, an escapee from a Florida Zoo who's gone a bit nutty from too many years of isolation. He's cowardly, eccentric, and always doing the wrong thing at the worst time possible, in the most endearing way possible. There's also something to be said for the mere presence of a mostly hairless ape in a ski vest.War for the Planet of the Apes delivers everything you could want from a summer action movie: great effects, spectacular battle scenes, frequent suspense, good comic relief, and even some smart pop-culture references. But more than that, it's a work of depth and nuance that will make you think, feel, and maybe bring an occasional tear to your eye. It ups the action and spectacle of its predecessors while remaining as thoughtful and character driven as ever, and is far more human than a movie about apes has any right to be.","8/10"
"willphelan","4 November 2023","I never thought Into the Spider Verse was a movie that needed a sequel, but Across the Spider Verse is just as incredible as Into the Spider Verse. The animation style is even more beautiful than in the first movie, every shot looks like a painting. The exploration of Miles and Gwen and what it really means to be Spider Man is excellent, and leads to so many deep and emotional moments. Every scene with Miles' parents were top tier. The voice cast all gave it everything they had, and Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen was the stand out for me. The cliffhanger ending was so epic, it actually gave me chills. If the third movie is as good as these first two this might become the best trilogy of all time. 10/10.","10/10"
"willz187","18 February 2023","I thought this flick was pretty cool. Id maybe go see it again. I like that it didnt get into Star Trek territory. Maybe I just liked it because there hasnt been any good movies out lately. I loved seeing what the villain was all about. Id rather immerse myself in this CGI world than Avatar. It has some different characters, giving us something other than superheroes and tech. If youre looking for something to trip out on, something like Aquaman, its freaking awesome. The realm feels like when Dr Strange fought Dormammu, which was an wicked scene. When i compare it to the other stuff out there like on TV Carnival Row, Picard, Moon Girl...Quantumania blows them out of the microshpere.","7/10"
"willz187","28 February 2019","I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.","10/10"
"wilsodan","5 February 2024","The acting in this movie is pathetic, the plot is not much better.The storyline has potential but sadly its a badly put together movie, it is all over the place with some of the worst acting I have ever seen, a lot of unknowns actors who are should go back to their old jobs.They say the budget was 36mil, I would have thought 3mil, it would have to be up there with worst worst movies ever made, it maybe had potential but sadly the acting makes it very difficult to watch.I am at a loss to work out how this movie is rating above 6, surely our taste for a good movies has not stopped this low, we couldn't get through it all, it's embarrassing to watch.","2/10"
"winstonhallman","18 April 2019","Without a doubt the best Dragonball movie ever. The animations are the best the series has ever been.

"wisdomwasp","9 March 2023","This was an enjoyable ride. There were glimpses, glimpses of that old Marvel magic at times, the humour, and a decent bad guy actually well used. But honestly Paul Rudd carries this film. He's the only actor who really shines, and eats up every scene he's in. The daughter and Kang are decent too.But it's good to watch a Marvel film without really any SJW nonsense. The focus on story and some jokes might be pushing Marvel back in the right direction (can only hope).The setting was unique and diffferent, but after a while it grated with the overuse of SciFi CGI. It's given me enough to want to see more Kang and maybe theres still life in the old Marvel yet.","1/10"
"WiseMan26","16 February 2023","Yes. I love the introduction of Kang, The Conqueror. Jonathan is definitely suitable for this role. Very convincing. Kathryn also need to improve more on acting, when doing emotional scene, she not good yet. Storyline is a bit flaws. It's like more on the Scott family, and less Kang story. Also, a lot of CGI using, it's like you watching James Avatar. Also side character, brings this movie a bit comedy, I like the slime (always talk about holes😂😂😂). By the way, it is worth watching. It is a must, if you waiting for the fourth avengers, then you must because it will continue from this movie (spoilers).","7/10"
"wolfiemn","15 January 2024","I saw an early review of this movie before it's release and the person doing the critique said ""January/February is where studios put movies that they are sending out to die. They are not award winners, and are not summer blockbusters"".I have to disagree wholeheartedly with that assessment. Sure it won't win awards, but if you are a fan of John Wick movies, or a fan of Jason Statham, you will enjoy this movie to the max. When it started, this movie could have gone a whole different directions. But the story is good, the action is exciting and inventive. Jason Statham is as always a bad ass. Josh Hutcherson plays someone you will love to hate. And Jeremy Irons, always love his movies.","7/10"

By the end I was hoping one of the bad guys would just shoot Statham's character instead of standing there pointing their gun at him and waiting for him to knock them cold.The only way that a film like this could maintain interest is if the fight scenes showed some variety as the story goes along.

"wwwwebtebbusiness","28 April 2019","A movie review must be without desire or force.
This is the first film of Avengers Saga in which I found about 10 mistakes and so I am disappointed and very dissatisfied.
1. ) What would happen if Winston Churchill or Hitler of 1930 come to 2019 and got killed by someone ? Certainly the past will be charged, but the movie says nothing will change.
What would happen if you go to the past of year 1930 and killed Hitler ? Of course the the past will be charged but the movie says nothing will change.
2.) Caption America is a man, then how could he able to successfully and permanently use the hammer -🔨 Mjolnir ?
3.) Do you know the name of the place which created the 🔨 Mjolnir or weapons of Asgardians ? How can Avengers's laboratory more capable than that place (Nidavellir). In the Endgame there was no harm to Infinity Gruntlet of Avengers even after 2 times use. But the Gruntlet of Infinity War movie, created at Nidavellir, was destroyed only after 1 time use.
4. ) How was it possible for Iron Man to hold and successfully use all the six Infinity Stones. He is simply a man or half robot.
5. ) In Endgame, Thor went to his past and got his hammer and returned to his future with that hammer. Then, what would happen with the Thor of the past ? Suppose we went to 6 August 1945 and returned to the future after stealing atomic bombs, then what would happen with Japan ? Suppose we went to 1940 and kidnapped Stalin and returned to the future with him. Then what would happen with WW2 and the USSR ?
6. ) A man can create more capable weapon than God ? A man can handle a powerful weapon of God ? We can change our past without changing our present or future ?Avengers Endgame is a highly exaggerated and superfluous movie trying to please and satiate 100 percent audiences.","1/10"
"Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024","Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else.

"xiaohuoontheroad","21 November 2012","It is very hard to give this masterful creation of Ang Lee a tangible rating and critic, because much of the takeaway of the film, is for the moviegoers and readers of the original novel to contemplate. It is also very hard to rate because it has been such a hard movie to make, out of a novel that addresses both the strength of faith and weakness of humanity in a rhetoric way.Ang Lee did it, although painstakingly. I was amazing by the soul of the film, thru the eyes of the Bengal tiger (amazingly) and the maiden acting of 17-year-old non-professional actor. The conversation about the journey of life that Ang Lee has succeeded in engaging us into is a special kind that few artists like him is able to deliver.The opening music is magic.The one point I deducted is my faith in Ang Lee. I will save that for his next film.Happy Thanksgiving, movie lovers.","10/10"
"xiaoli7377","17 February 2023","""Quantumania"" was pretty entertaining. The standout from this film is obviously the introduction of Kang (Jonathan Majors) into the MCU. Another run of the mill Marvel film, nothing to crazy and it follows the very formulaic standard at this point. The computer effects and the green screen compositing in this one looked super off to me, I saw this in IMAX with a couple of friends and everything looked very digital like I was watching a video game cutscene. Some of the jokes landed, some fell flat on their face. MODOK (Corey Stoll) is mainly used as a throwaway sidekick for Kang and it's honestly just really goofy to see on the big screen and is not used to his full potential as a villain.This is another mediocre entry into Marvel's extremely lackluster Phase Four; I feel like this franchise has definitely lost all of it's steam and momentum after the conclusion of the Thanos saga. I had hopes that this one would finally be the one to break the series out of its lull, but I guess that we'll have to keep waiting for that. It's not terrible by any means, but it's one that will only really be remembered for the characters it introduces and not for the quality of the film itself.","3/10"

Old world versus new world, hard work versus fast money, decent versus unscrupulous. 25 minutes that do you good, good old politically incorrect action, the white knight fighting evil, the return of the avenger, by any means necessary. Then, unfortunately, a small or large CGI damper. Forget about it, it's onwards and upwards, no time to take a breather, no time to get angry, because the dark side doesn't give up so easily. It has now completely infiltrated the state apparatus, eating away at it, a freak show of criminal egomaniacs in designer clothes. However, the Beekeeper is the wrong address for this, no compromises, no handbrake on, the cleansing of the system has only just begun. 101% cliché, completely reactionary, one embarrassing one-liner after another, characters from the prototype drawing board, Six Feet Under realism, women kissing fists, generally absolutely violent. The self-proclaimed film intelligentsia is boiling. Never mind, they would be taken away with them, just like any rudimentary servant of evil, plus anyone else who gets in the way of the Beekeeper, including civil servants. Too bad, that's the way it is when the pay cheque comes from hell. Statham does Statham things and Ayer is misunderstood in my opinion. He's just having fun making it as clumsy as possible, regardless of whatever! Demolition? Absolutely! Torture? No problem! Completely question the supposed institutions of jurisdiction and implementation? By all means! Even the top person in the government is involved in criminal business?

"yaszi-83296","10 November 2021","This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise.

"yeswestan","25 August 2023","I was a HUGE fan of the first movie. I went into it expecting the multiple spider-people to be confusing and overwhelming and left the theatre a new person. I bought the art book. I studied the style. I wrote about this franchise in my college application essays.And to now see that the animation has only improved just blows me away. I see how the filmmakers adapted the praise and excitement about the animation and colors and cranked it up; this movie is somehow more beautiful than the last. The comedy is excellent. The soundtrack is engaging and creative. The cast of characters and background spider-people only drive the point further that anyone can be spider-man with the level of diversity among them. The writing and dialogue is just amazing, the cast is wonderful, and the conflict feels real and devastating.The only real negatives I can think of are that it was kind of a lot/messy, and it sucks that this movie was split into two; that makes it feel like the story was only just getting started before it suddenly stopped.This film truly shows what animation is capable of. All the elements come together so well.And lastly, I'm Indian. So seeing Pavitr Prabhakar on the big screen not only representing the Indian community, but also our culture in a way that was fun and relatable made me so happy. I understand that the movie serves more of a base-level view on Indian culture but seeing as the movie isn't really about that, I think they did a good job, especially with the entire Mumbattan environment. I loved every second of it. People don't realize how much representation matters. I'm grateful.","10/10"
"yishu-75061","3 May 2019","Movie is good no second thoughts about it, but it is far from being great. I felt little disappointed for how Marvel handled Time Travel in Endgame. There's eventually no cause and effect phenomenon in this movie. One can do what ever they want in past and still nothing gets affected in current (future timeline). Nebula kills her pastself but current Nebula should also have erased from existence, but we didn't see that.
Overall it's good but time travel could have been depicted differently.
Characters literally messed a lot with past self still there was no consequence. Thor brought Mjolnir with him in future leaving no weapon for past Thor.
If Tony stole that Teseract then Fury would never have got access to Tesseract but that too doesn't seem to have any affect on current timeline.
Disappointed with time travel philosophy of Endgame.And story felt bit not too much but bit exaggerated. Movie could have been shortened by 20 minutes easily.
There were several scenes which felt unnecessary and several scenes were not showed, like how Thanos was able to bring whole army to current timeline if Nebula took only one tube of Pym Particle.
The action sequences are great and VFX is just amazing. I didn't find any problems in CGI.
It great but still it doesn't deserve 10/10.","9/10"

This one will not disappoint as it's a fast moving, exciting, piece of action that's worthy of the $11 ticket price.Some of the best action sequences on film are here with a pretty decent little revenge story. I found myself rooting for Statham as he kicks apart the greedy corporate culture that preys on unsuspecting people.Turns out his character is one you don't want to mess with or piss off especially when it comes to his friends. I found myself comparing the current presidential administration and tried to figure out was this the useless child of our current commander in chief or that person who lost in 2016.

Like a lot of good action movies thought it seem to go by pretty fast. The movie doesn't drag and does a good job with its pacing.This time around Miles Morales finds his spdey going across dimensions to save the universe. I'm not revealing any spoilers but let's just say for the fans of the comics, this one stays true to the material. The soundtrack isn't bad either and helps with the pacing. Above all this is one super hero done right. Recommend you see it on the largest screen you can find. Maybe even the drive in.","5/10"

Her friends almost didn't mention her after a short period of grief like no one else In the end, when someone is remembered all over the world, she almost seems to have never existed. Can it be worse?","9/10"
"ylshu-02284","16 May 2020","What I like: it's a good ending. It's connected with the previous plot. It's about the past and the future, reality and memory, emotion and choice. What I don't like: there are too many boring slogans; there is too much discord in the existence of the surprise captain, and there is no such shock in the trailer.","1/10"

Maybe i'll get hated for the rest of my life for writing this . I really don't get what everyone is so excited about . I was not impressed !! Overall i'd say the story is worth , but actually whatching the show isn't worth it at all . For me , Dragon Ball still is number one anime in Malaysia !!","10/10"

"youngbmega","6 May 2023","Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has begun, and how did it start? Actually not as expected. Not convincing! Not impressive! With the advent of such an antagonist, the story should have developed as intensely, disturbingly and dangerously as possible. But we got what we got, and obviously this is not what many expected. The history of the family is good (it was clear from the trailers too), but the characters could have been better developed, the relationship between Scott and Casey, as well as Janet and Hope. But somehow you do not fully believe them. Plus, in the previous pictures it was said that the Quantum Realm is so dangerous that it is better not to go there. And what happened?! The danger is Kang himself, and the world is beautiful, but not really unsettling. As a result, it is mandatory to watch, as this is the seed for the future, especially the scenes after the credits. But if you look at the general line of the movie universe, 6/10.","7/10"
"yourtamim","30 January 2019","Well as we all waited so long for the movie,let's take some deeper look into it.Bad Drawing-
As you've seen Broly movie was a piece of bad and lazy drawing.A well developed drawing was missing from the whole movie,surprising!
I'll blame Toei production for repeating this kind of mistakes even in their movies.It's a shame for a big production like Toei for doing such thing.Bad story line-
Well I wasn't surprised at all cause I was expecting this to be happen.
Literally I couldn't found a strong plot and any depth in the story.That Bardock sequence was so boring that I almost closed my eyes for a nap.Like seriously? That was Goku's father!! Where is the hype! where is the damn thrill thinking about it. I can remember when I was a kid how much excited I was to see gokus father.But when this non-canon fairy tail actually came into reality.I was disappointed seriously. and I'm not the only one who've been missing good story line from the time of Boo saga.absurd jokes-
Like seriously? Frieza wants those dragon balls to increase His heights?
The way of throwing these jokes were awful as hell.only that fusion part was funny.
*It's not comedy if you feel annoyed of it*well only the good part maybe was those fighting scenes.Toei worked hard for that for sure. I dunno but expected a lot more as we've waited more than 10 months for that thing to come and can't remember how much freaking years for
Broly to take part in main story line.
well umm
I felt like it was nothing but a 1h 41m special episode that Toei used to broadcast in every week.
I am disappointed as hell btw.*coffee time*","3/10"

"yrwann","13 June 2018","Because guess what, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a straight up porn for any fan of cinématography. The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need. These ""Avengers"" might be mentally disabled: can't think OR use abilities OR communicate with each other. Well, at least they succeeded at jabbing one another with some jokes (a benevolent 1 star for this).","8/10"
"YYYYYYYYYYyyYYYYYYYYYYY","29 July 2023","Another fail by Marvel.Fail by Fail by Fail.Looks like some kind of Power Rangers stuff.In Comics, Kang is supposedly stronger than Thanos and is one of the strongest non-celes villan.But what do we see here? In matter of 30 min, Kang is defeated by by 2 human and ants. Marvel spent years after years developing Thanos, yet Kang, stronger than Thanos is defeated within hour.Who wrote this? Marvel lost their nuts, I'm sure of it. Their greed for money has taken over and threw them off of their path.And again, how is a teenager who never studied physics and mathematics - who is environmentalist - suddenly develops quantum machine, outsmarting Iron-Man?Dude, stop making dumb movies Marvel. Massive fail.","8/10"
"Zachary_Butler","21 November 2012","Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast, you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too. 9/10. Worth it.","9/10"
"Zainahhh","23 November 2012","For those who do not know, Life of Pi is a famous novel written by Yann Martel.As a person who has read the book, I have to say I am incredibly amazed at how accurate the movie was and how every little detail was incorporated in the novel. The 3d animations were extraordinary and it was just as I had imagined when I read the book. It was very realistic and the scenes were calming to the mind.The actors, where do I begin? Amazing just like how I remember them acting like in the book. I never really cry in films, but I did in this one. Very touching, very realistic and very exciting.I don't remember blinking or breathing at times threw the film. It's an exciting adventure that takes you threw the journey in the eyes of Pi Patel. Enjoy it!","9/10"
"zaner-22667","28 November 2020","This film is definitely one of the the best finales to a trilogy ever, the story is amazing and the ending was beautiful.
Caesar's death doesn't feel forced, it was truly beautiful. This was one of the few movies that I've ever cried in.
I love the story about how there's not many humans left on the planet and the apes have basically become the humans of Earth by the end of the film.
One thing I love about all the films is that it makes you love the apes and you really start to hate most the humans. It's truly an amazing film.
I highly recommend this film and the entire trilogy.","8/10"
"zbuuury","14 February 2019","It has everything wou could hope to see in a Dragon Ball movie. Considering how weak are the other movies, this one makes up for every lasg one of them. It has a lot of action and also a good story behind it.
Congratulations and hopefully many more to come!","7/10"
"ZeddaZogenau","3 November 2023","Entertaining conclusion (?) to the Indiana Jones film series!I was very pleased that the German actor Thomas KRETSCHMANN made a nice villain appearance. EUROPEAN FILM AWARD winner Mads MIKKELSEN shines as an ultra-nasty Wernher von Braun blend. Wonderfully old-fashioned adventure film that hops from Morocco to Greece to Sicily!After three weeks in theaters, the film grossed almost $300 million worldwide. That's probably far too little for the Hollywood major studio DISNEY, but my cinema was full. And the audience had a lot of fun. You can't expect more from summer popcorn cinema. Worth seeing!","5/10"
"zeki-4","28 June 2023","I almost gave up all hope. Every action blockbuster nowadays are either defying gravity, mostly shot in front of a green screen or simply lacks an engaging plot. Maybe I'm getting too old. But 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' certainly made me feel young again.No, it is not as great as the first three of course, and yes, there is the occasional use of CGI, but seeing real people doing real stunts in real locations on the silver screen is what made me fall in love with action movies in the first place.What sticks out as a positive surprise is the production design. Case in point: There's an actionscene which takes place during a huge parade in New York. When they shot the scenes every store and facade were made to look like New York in 1969. Posters, merhandise, etc. You hardly see this in the movie, but the meticulous attention to detail is felt throughout the movie.I also really like the themes of this movie. A perfect fit for the swan song of the legend, Indiana Jones.","3/10"
"zenmilos","2 July 2023","We got the continuation, in this case I really hope the final one, of the franchise that amused us in the 80's of the last century. Like everything that modern Hollywood, and most of all Disney, has touched in this century, only confirms that all we can expect is that everything new will only be worse than the previous one. Of course, no one still thinks of investing in original stories and some new heroes, it is enough to grab a few more dollars on nostalgia for some better, past times.Hand on heart, it should be said that the beginning of the first 15 minutes of the movie is somewhat reminiscent of the original sequels. Unfortunately, then the ""real"" Indian Jones appears, who represents everything so-called-feminist Hollywood considers a modern female character - an unsympathetic, arrogant person without any character, who never needs any help, with a solution for every situation, without even any trace of humor or sex appeal, with such acting skills that she can't even serve as ""comic relief"" in any movie.Averagely directed, without any meaningful plot, with characters and villains that appear without any logic every time we should expect it. The scenes of time travel and the siege of Syracuse 212-211 BCE I don't know what could be compared to, except with the worst episodes of the Doctor Who series. It's a good thing that the screenwriters didn't think of including, in the already unoriginal and non-imaginitive story, for eg. Parallel universes, although, allegedly, in the original version, Indiana Jones was supposed to be replaced by a female counterpart, but after test screenings, the ending was reshot and changed.The recommendation is, of course, that if you can at all, skip this movie, which according to reports has already failed miserably at the box office. If you watch it anyway, at least the hated 4th sequel will seem like a perfectly acceptable achievement after this misdeed.","7/10"
"ZeroMajor","1 June 2023","Never would have thought this movie would be 'MILES' better than its prequel, the countless amount of easter eggs for the Spider-fans, along with an engaging story that had its fun parts of action and meaningful interactions between well-thought out characters without losing the pace or intensity of the story. Across the Spider-Verse is a testament of immaculate craftsmanship from the passion and hard work done by the animators and writers of the prequel. The pacing is splendidly well-done, even the times where nothing major happens in the story is filled to the brim with fun interactions that breathe character to the people we all love in this story. I'll be waiting for Beyond the Spider-Verse next year. Go above and beyond!","10/10"
"Zhi-ling","22 August 2022","The scenes in the movie are really beautiful and full of fantasy, but I will not watch PI again. Because the content is so depressing, it makes me breathless. The animals and even the islands are all metaphors. The truth is cruel.","8/10"
"zkonedog","2 July 2023","Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, & Harrison Ford created an iconic Indiana Jones trilogy with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, & Last Crusade. The idea was resurrected in 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull--but sadly in an extremely unfulfilling way. Hence it taking 15 more years to give Indy, hat, and whip a better send-off--which Dial of Destiny most certainly is.For a very basic overview, Dial of Destiny tells the story of Indy (Ford) in the late-1960s. Now a retiring professor, Dr. Jones is goaded into one further adventure--this time with family friend Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)--to find an antique dial that purports to alter the flow of time. As per the usual, the Nazis--this time embodied by former goose-stepper Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen)--harbor similar intentions.Even though it might not be obvious all the time, Dial of Destiny actually gives Indy fans everything they might want out of a legacy finale. For example...-Digital de-aging of Ford gives viewers who missed the original trilogy's theatrical run a taste of what that must have been like.-Old friends Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) & Marion (Karen Allen) return in poignant roles.-There is action/adventure aplenty, as director James Mangold fills this flick to the brim with set pieces and chases of every kind.-All strains of John Williams' iconic score are present and accounted for.Add all this together and Dial of Destiny is a highly entertaining send-off for such an iconic celluloid hero.Now, is Dial of Destiny a perfect, all-time classic? Personally, I have it below Raiders and Last Crusade, but about on par with Temple of Doom (and light years ahead of Crystal Skull!). This one is heavy on the chase sequences (to the possible detriment of some character development) and the final 10-15 might be challenging to some. Not bad, per se, but just far different than anything expected.Overall, though, I had a fun time watching all two hours and 34 minutes of this Indy character finale. I'm a bit befuddled by the critical panning, as Dial of Destiny is certainly better than ""just okay"". In fact, I have a feeling that subsequent viewing might bump this film even higher. I certainly feel a lot better about the legacy of Indiana Jones (and all involved) than I did back in 2008.","6/10"
"zmain141","17 January 2019","From start to finish, this movie doesn't disappoint. It is a perfect ending for the Dragon Ball: Super series.

"zvezdochkapetrova","2 September 2018","Yep, you heard me....Just don't. 
If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.*
If you deal with anxiety, panic, depression, or anything else, *don't.*
This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters.
It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing.
Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it.
Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.","10/10"

They should give refunds to everyone who went to see this garbage.The most unlikable characters the MCU has ever produced. The movie only has two types of characters: annoying girl-boss and annoying pathetic loser. These characters aren't relatable because these are the type of people you run away from on the street.Let's dump 300million into the CGI vomit machine and hope no one realizes how terrible the movie is. This is the grand strategy behind the geniuses at Marvel. It's sad and pathetic.I'm giving this a 1/10 because it has no value, and I left the theater in a worse state than I went in.","8/10"
