"cyguration","8 April 2021","...of an Academy Award.A lot of people felt Serkis should have won for his portrayal of Gollum, but he puts that performance to shame with his turn as the not-so-poker faced leader of the apes, Caesar.It's the understated emotion that really bubbles to the surface in Serkis' depiction of the reluctant but always resolute Caesar.It's not easy to give a performance through a CGI ape and convey to the audience through vocal intonations and an extremely limited speaking script the hurt, the ambition, the hate, and the pain that Caesar feels, yet paired with an incredibly talented special effects team, Serkis manages to pull it off.I suppose I can't give all the credit to them, because the script for this film is way above par. It works on so many different levels, and it's really quite something because I just got done watching Godzilla vs Kong, and oh boy is there such a stark difference in screenplay quality between the two films.All while watching War For The Planet of the Apes I was thinking to myself ""Why couldn't the Transformers get this sort of on-screen characterization and treatment?"" The Hollywood excuse is always ""No one wants to see robots fighting for two hours!"" and yet that's always the best and only parts worth watching when it comes to the Transformer films.Here, however, director Matt Reeves flipped the script (I suppose you could say literally) by putting the focus on the CGI apes instead of the humans. The entire story is about Caesar -- everyone else plays second fiddle to Caesar.It basically proves that you can make a quality, character-driven film without tacking on some ridiculous human sub-plots just to pad out the time or tie together action scenes.In this particular case War For The Planet Of The Apes is probably misnomer given that this is not an action film. Yes, there are action scenes, but this is all character drama, with a few action set pieces to payoff the trilogy.I thought the original Dawn of the Planet Of The Apes was an okay film, nothing too memorable. I didn't care all that much for Rise of the Planet of the Apes. However, I have to say that I adore War For The Planet Of The Apes.The difference boils down to bringing the emotion out of the leads (who are all CGI apes), giving the main antagonist a complex and multi-dimensional approach to his self-proclaimed ""purpose"" and a few twists you likely won't see coming.I can understand why a lot of people may not like the film because it's methodically filmed and paced. This isn't The Fast & The Furious, and if you go in expecting more ""War"" rather than ""Planet of the Apes"" then I suppose you'll be sorely disappointed.However, if you're looking for a movie that's actually really well directed, better written than it has any reason to be, and a lot more emotionally driven than most other Oscar-bait dramas, then you'll definitely enjoy War For The Planet Of The Apes.And it still irks me that Serkis wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance. I didn't bother checking to see who won best actor for 2017, but I'm finding it hard to believe anyone turned in a more layered, heartfelt, and multi-dimensional performance than Serkis did with Caesar.","

"michaelRokeefe","9 January 2018","This is the third chapter of the acclaimed Planet of the Apes franchise. Matt Reeves directs and this episode that is nice on the eyes to watch. Enough activity to keep your interest and story line that moves along at a good pace for a two hour twenty minute movie.Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his apes are goaded into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a devious, head-strong Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Caesar tangles with his inner, dark instincts and comes to grips with his own mythical stature avenging his own kind. He comes face to face with the Colonel as bitter challengers in a battle that will determine the fate of both species. Ape versus Man and the future of the planet.Really impressive is Steve Zahn playing Bad Ape. Also in the cast are: Amiah Miller, Judy Greer, Aleks Paunovic, Karin Konoval, Toby Kebbell and Michael Adamthwaite.","

"urthpainter","25 July 2017","Seriously needs to reevaluate the criteria by which they review films. Why? Because giving this film 1/10 says, ""I am ignorant of quality film making."" Descriptions like slow and boring just don't cut it! Opinions like this are an act of ultimate laziness - the inability to mentally invest in the passive experience of a film. An inability to invest in a well made film that has something to say no less.Everyone has the right to an opinion - but when a person abandons merit before their eyes, and quality film making is overlooked by choice? That is simply, unfortunate. I can continue to admonish those without taste, but what good is that?War for the Planet of the Apes isn't a good movie - it's a Great movie!!! I thought part one was above average, part two was surprisingly good - but this movie? Its a borderline classic!In a nutshell, War for the Planet of the Apes is a struggle for survival between Caesar's group of sentient apes (gorillas, orangutans), and a derelict group of soldiers led by a broken/crazed leader. This fight begins as open warfare but moves to very close quarter survival between captors and prisoners. There is a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences - and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Normally I am very critical of this type of film, but not this time! Everything serves the characters and story - and in doing so becomes a project that far exceeds the sum of its parts. Yes this movie has death, suffering and plight - and it also has heroism, empathy and displays the strength of unity.The effects are astonishing - and immediately allow the viewer to slip into the world in a believable way. It is possible that this movie is 5 years ahead of its time. It may be a while before another film achieves this level of drama, all while being a heavily effect driven experience.Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to selfish, ""give me action"" needs. More science fiction should be this brave and literate. I love movies that ask interesting questions and can bring you on an emotional adventure. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films - good movies in their own right.Way more I could talk up: great soundtrack! The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action - the best kind of soundtracking - beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters, many of whom never utter a word of dialog! This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.For me, best movie of the 2017 summer - maybe the year!All the 1* reviews at IMDb are a mystery... audience approval for this movie isn't this low. Very odd, anyways for those who care, critics got this one right - 9/10.","

"Uncle-Feggster","15 June 2018","Sometimes, when I read reviews about movies on IMDb, I see patterns in the writing. Similar text, similar structuring and similar indignant shouting. Read enough of them and you see that quite often there is an underlying reason why the reviews are marking a film so low. Be it political or religious. Very rarely is it actually about the quality of the film. More often it is about a personal issue that the reviewer has - and so he vents his anger in the only way that's he knows how - a screaming one star rating and a list of reasons why the film is the worst he has ever seen. Makes you wonder what kind of a strange person would do that.However, if you read past all the silly 1 star ratings you often get to the truth. And the truth as far as this film is concerned is that it is a cracker. It draws you in like none of the other ape movies - it's pacing is superb, the visual effect stunning. I would suggest that you ignore the ranting 1 star reviews and take them for what's they are - a few individuals with multiple accounts and strange views on the world.","

"ma-cortes","15 November 2019","This War of the Planet of Apes is an intense and exciting film with great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology . The picture delivers enough energy and turns out to be an impressive flick full of fighting, action , battles and suspense . An acceptable Ape movie with huge production design in which the performers are very fine , and special mention for Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs . There concerns Caesar (masterfullly incarnated by Andy Serkis, Gollum alter-ego) , a chimpanzee who gained human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that rose to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape upheaval . As Caesar and his apes : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan , are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel . Along the way the apes suffer unimaginable losses and Caesar (Andy Serkis), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator (first outing with Will Rodman: James Franco) . Here Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and starts his own mythic quest to avenge his kind that is being submitted in slavery and apartheid . Later on , Caesar is locked and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . As simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas uprising violently every human in sight . As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) are pitted against each other in an impressive battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.This awesome film is a brilliant and intelligent sequel that contains fights , thrills , frenetic action , go riding , violence , breathtaking scenes and a strong denounce about animal mistreat . Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Recent sequel in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by the mythical film ¨Planet of Apes¨ (1968) by Franklyn J. Schaffner that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . It deals with a Chimpanzee hero called Caesar well played by Andy Serkis , this is the third film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular ending scenes when happens a fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . As Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape . The flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about vengeance , apartheid , upon origin of human being , racism , and mistreating ; though also packs action , adventures , intrigue and entertainment . Being mostly a decent follow-up of the former stories , with big moments of energy remaining throughout and it results to be , particularly , a breathtaking Sci-Fi movie full of frantic action , battles, suspense and top-notch FX by Oscarized team who made Avatar and Lord of the Rins . The performers , particularly Andy Serks and Woody Harrelson are pretty good , the characters are well drawn and in spite of excessive computer generator frames all of them are still oddly convincing . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the third live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling , self aware animal . Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Similar the previous films, this is an Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of overlong scenes in Motion Capture they are still nicely and compellingly made . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , along with Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves himself , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it's full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , Let me in , Cloverfield)
Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are as follows : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J. Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , followed by ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels : Escape from the planet of apes , Conquest for battle of Apes and Battle for Planet of Apes. A reboot Planet of Apes 2011 by Tim Burton . And new remakes : Rise of the planet of Apes 2011, and Dawn of the Planet of Apes (2014) .","

"namashi_1","8 October 2017","The third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot series, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a terrific film, that is grim & thought-provoking, and bravely pushes the Blockbuster Genre, by offering more soul than gimmicks. With a Sterling, Oscar-worthy Performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the apes, to a Screenplay that is dark & powerful & Deft Direction, this recent box-office & critical smash is among the year's best films! 'War for the Planet of the Apes' Synopsis: After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a tale on love, hate, revenge & survival. And in a world where Presidents behave like dictators & discriminate the minorities, this Apes versus Humans spell-binder comes close to the current state of times we live in & questions hate & violence with thundering ferocity. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is brave enough to remain a grim story on a leader broken & consumed in hate, ready to protect his misunderstood tribe by a sadist & ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson, in an electrifying performance). Its disturbing & powerful story on Caesar's fight, with a mad-load of violence & thought-provoking confrontations, that are SURE to give your goose-pimples. Its power-packed stuff.Mark Bomback & Matt Reeves's Screenplay is excellent. The Writing is super-strong & makes for a solid third installment. Reeves's Direction is intense to the core. This is Reeves at his finest, as a writer & director. Michael Seresin's Cinematography captures the carnage, with astonishing results. William Hoy & Stan Salfas's Editing is top-notch. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. Michael Giacchino's Score is enchanting, as always. Performance-Wise: Andy Serkis needs to be awarded. His return as Caesar in a yet another motion-capture performance, defines emotion. Serkis is simply superb, enacting the bruised & broken hero with gut-wrenching honesty. Has the Academy been sleeping? I mean, how can one not include Serkis in the finest performances of the year? Give him his due, Nominate Serkis for his impeccable work in 'War for the Planet of the Apes', it would only prove to be a rich moment in your history. Second in command is Woody Harrelson, who puts the screen on fire. In one of his scariest roles, the Thespian portrays a villain that's hard to forget. The TREMENDOUS Steve Zahn is extraordinary & adds the much needed relief in the intense proceedings. Karin Konoval, also, is marvelous. Rest lend incredible support.On the whole, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is A Mighty Winner! Don't Miss It.","

"BenjaminPopkin","30 March 2022","Not my favorite of the trilogy, but definitely an amazing film.That opening scene was even better than the last one. The CGI is the best of the trilogy in this installment for sure. If the last one didn't get Andy Serkis a nomination for an Oscar, then this one certainly should have. Some of his best work ever IMO. They didn't win an Oscar for visual effects either which I honestly find bizarre. This film also has the best music of the trilogy by far.My main issue with the film is that it starts to feel lengthy towards the end and I think they could have cut some things for sure. Also the girl was kind of pointless, she didn't really do anything or add that much, other than showing an emotional side to the apes. But, other than that I had no other real problems. I did get some Logan vibes.I liked the revenge plot and Caesar battling his inner demons. I liked how Caesar offers peace again to humans and it doesn't work out just like the previous time. Could have used more Woody Harrelson. He stole his scenes though. I also totally agreed with his perspective because if it was real we would all be on his side because we are the last of humanity so I could see how he feels the need to wipe out the apes because the law of nature says they will replace the humans. You root for the apes because that's what we're watching but if it was real we would all be team Woody.Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes is an amazing film. The cinematography, music, acting, CGI, and characters are all amazing. Caesar, Maurice, Luca and Rocket are such amazing characters who use such little actual dialogue, yet they can still carry the film so well. Also Bad Ape was really funny and I like that they finally decided to add some form of comedy in the trilogy. I also liked the concept of the zoo ape. The ending of this film is also perfect and definitely a tear jerker. This trilogy was just so well done.The Planet of the Apes trilogy is one of my favorite trilogy's of all time for sure. The character development, storyline, all the visual effects, acting, and emotions that it puts you through is just so amazing. Lengthy but worth it in the long run. If you haven't seen any of these films I suggest you watch them, they are all so great. Now, I'm going to watch the originals.I do think War is the same as Dawn in terms of quality and filmmaking, but overall Dawn is still my favorite of the trilogy. Also, War is a better film than Rise, but I think out of the trilogy and rewatchability that I may like Rise more than War.","

"larrymeers","17 July 2017","Before i saw this movie i looked at some people's opinions about it and i saw mostly negative reviews, so i was really nervous going into this movie thinking that i would have had the same reaction to it and seriously i have no idea what those people are talking about. So War for the planet of the apes is the 3rd film in the new prequel/Reboot of the planet of the apes movies. And this is about Caeser going on a journey to stop a war between his apes and an army of highly trained soldiers, while he also tries to control his more violent instincts. First the obvious, the CGI is amazing and is truly a technological marvel to cinema. Andy Serkis once again plays the ape ruler Caesar and is easily the best movie character in recent years, in each film he has gotten progressively better and in this one it is definitely the best performance. The story is great and is well acted throughout. This movie is also an amazing drama. There are a lot of moments that just make you jerk a tear every once in a while and its believable. The action sequences are pretty good too. Woody Harrelson plays the colonel and he does a pretty good job at it (He is not as good as koba but still good). He is just a character that you can relate to and you understand why he is doing all of this. Caesar and the colonel are pretty relatable. As much as i would love to say how great this movie is, i better stop right here. I loved every part of this movie and i did not find anything i did not like about it, but i am gonna talk about why i think most people were disappointed with this film. So if you watched all the trailers and looked at the title you may be expecting one thing, a ton of apes and humans fighting with guns and rockets. But although there is some of that in this movie, its definitely not the main point of it. This movie to its core is about the war that a person faces emotionally while war is happening around him. We see this concept with Caesar all the way through the movie. It also talks about what terrible things a person or people would do in a war. Woody Harrelson's character does what he does because he believes that the entire human race is going to go extinct if he does not act. I mean, would you do that if you knew that you could slowly be replaced by another species? So some people do not like this film because they were expecting a full on hardcore war movie. And it is that, but it really is a commentary about how a person has a war within themselves when war is happening around them. And people either missed, did not care, or did not understand the more darker themes about this movie. But anyway, in the end i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every way it could have been. It has amazing CGI, performances, action sequences, dark themes, tear jerking moments, and a beautiful moral to it. A+ or 10/10 APES TOGETHER STRONG!","

"AnishMisra","11 October 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a film directed by Matt Reeves. I loved the first 2 films of this series. And was looking forward to this film for quite some time. Finally when I saw the film, I can definitely say I'm Spechless. This film is definitely one of the best 2017 has to offer.Plot: Caesar and his ape family face the wrath of a ruthless Colonel.Story and direction: The film is basically an arc. It started with Caeser as a small child, then the Caesar who grew up for the torture his community suffered and finally to fight back. This film is a masterpiece in itself. And not only in terms of production quality, but the story is so pure. It touches upon things that I was quite shocked to see. The very first scene of this film, sets the tone of the film to be very dark. But then we see that Caesar doesn't just want out to go on killing humans, he just want them to back off his ape community. Then we see his visions of Koba as to what he did to him. Blue Eyes' mate Lake was also a very significant character. I did resonate with her in the scene where she sees Blue Eyes after a long time. But certain events then happen, that force Caesar to do things that are quite dark. And then a dialogue, ""You are no less than Koba"" by Maurice was so thought provoking. Then we have Nova, the girl who initially was scared of the apes but finally decides to be with them in their cause, because she saw the apes for how good they were. And finally Bad Ape. I guess that was a great addition to this franchise. His fear and his humor (which was subtle) were all very justified. The way he says he gets his name was good. Michael Giacchino's music is to look out for. The VFX is top notch. It never felt like the VFX was fake. It felt so natural. The sets too very magnificent and natural to the setting of the story.Performances: Andy Serkis should take a bow from me. What a performance and what a genius he is. I couldn't imagine Caesar without this person. Woody Harrelson was also great as Colonel. He has his moments too. Amiah Miller was also great as Nova. Steve Zahn was just right for Bad Ape. Toby Kebbell was also good as the cold ape Koba (for the little screen time he received). A special mention to Terry Notary for Maurice. The way he supports Caesar is commendable.Favorite Scene: The scene where Caesar regrets not recognizing the hate Koba had for humans. Then Maurice says a very nice dialogue that one cannot know what feels inside. This dialogue has just made a seat in my minds. And it basically says about our society in general.Verdict: This is one of those films where I can say that the third part is the best. I couldn't take out a flaw in this film. I was spellbound as the credits were rolling. This film series will have a special place in my life.I am going to give this film a wholeheartedly deserving 10/10.","

"Jared_Andrews","26 July 2017","If you have forgotten what happened in the first two movies, don't worry. ""War"" opens with a clear and concise recap of the events leading up to this movie. It's a smart way to commence and an indication of the thoughtful nature with which this movie was made.The movie obviously depicts a literal war for planet between the humans and the apes. There's also a figurative and less obvious war going on—one for Caesar's soul. The movie is really about Caesar's battle to remain pure and free from hate in world that corrupted Koba and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson).This question remains open for much of the movie, as we see for the first time some real cracks in Caesar's previously infallible morals. He has real reasons to give into the hatred (as you will see), and his humanity is truly tested. It all boils down to one scene, which of course, I will not spoil. A bit is left to interpretation, but I personally found clarity in the scene and settled comfortably on my answer.This movie fulfills anything and everything you could possibly desire in the final installment of this trilogy. The action sequences deliver intensity and genuine feelings of danger. This wasn't like many movies of this sort where the ""good guys"" sort of seem invincible. Everyone felt vulnerable, which amplified the suspense greatly. Additionally, the storytelling is flawless. It's littered with foreshadowing, eye-popping imagery, and provocative social parallels.While the excellent visuals and storytelling were expected, there were also two elements that took me aback by how well they were executed. The first was the dialogue, which honored the Apes' basic vocabulary and still managed to showcase the depths of their awareness. The other element was the performances of the actors playing apes.This may sound strange to say, but I think Andy Serkis deserves serious Academy Award consideration. His gravitas and emotional complexity come across clearly even though he never actually appears on screen.Caesar is one of the most deeply fascinating and thoughtful characters in recent movie memory, as evidenced by his growth over these three movies. It's time Serkis received proper recognition for bringing Caesar to life.","

"TheLittleSongbird","26 July 2017","First thing off the bat, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' were thoroughly enjoyable films, more so than expected them to be, though they were not quite masterpieces. 'Rise' was exceptionally well made and very entertaining, provoked thought and had heart. 'Dawn' had a bigger and bolder approach and delivered just as much, if not more so, on the brains and heart.So naturally, expectations for 'War for the Planet of the Apes' were quite large. Unfortunately, despite really wanting to like it (have never watched a panned film expecting to hate it or an acclaimed expecting to love it, regardless of the general consensus, always thinking for myself and always try to be respectful and perceptive), 'War for the Planet of the Apes' was a disappointment. It is a long way from a terrible film, and is not deserving of the 1/10 ratings it's garnered (it's a 4 at least), that implies that there are no redeeming qualities at all that coming from a subjective person that is further from the truth, but out of the 2010's rebooted 'Planet of the Apes' trilogy it's the weakest by quite some way.There are a number of things to admire about 'War for the Planet of the Apes'. The best things about it are the production values and the design and characterisation of the apes. Simply put, the production values all round are exceptional. Once again the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and the scenery is strikingly atmospheric. It's the special effects and make-up that deserve the most praise, that the apes look so real and that it is hard to believe they were made with a mix of motion-capture and CGI key frame is once again testament to how good they look. Characterisation for them is every bit as incredible. When they communicate they don't need to say much and it is the most nuanced the film gets, when saying or doing little (as little as a glance or a gesture) it still feels like they're saying a lot.Just as good is the character and performance of Caesar. He has always been a hugely relatable and complex character and is much more compelling than any of the human characters here. One really roots for him, he is impeccably designed and remarkably nuanced in how he moves and communicates and he actually feels like a real character. One cannot talk about the film and not mention Andy Serkis, the man very rarely fails to amaze me and he gives an intensely moving portrayal of Caesar, definitely deserving of award recognition.A few of the action sequences are thrilling with much visceral tension in the best moments. The first 15-20 minutes are remarkably promising and highly suggestive of it being a good film. Although very closely indebted seemingly to Colonel Kurtz from 'Apocalypse Now', Woody Harrelson gives it his all and fares well compared to the rest of the human cast.On the other hand, the human characters are nowhere near as well-written or compelling as the apes. Many are underwritten to the point of banality, underused and some add little to nothing to the story (especially the little girl). Harrelson aside, the acting from the humans isn't so hot either, the little girl is really annoying and very overwrought.The script is also very messy, lacking the intelligent simplicity and nuance of the previous two films, and instead resorting to awkwardness and cheesiness. The story started off promisingly but went down the plug fast. The pacing became incredibly dull and stayed that way for most of the film, seriously struggling to sustain the overlong running time, and is filled with crass and gratuitous graphic violence, cartoonish villainy that has more cheese than threat, a strong lack of emotional core and tension, nothing to drive the story forward and a general lack of cohesion. Things feel very rushed, leaden and confused in the final act.Matt Reeves did a great job directing 'Dawn...'. Here one really questions what happened and whether it really is the same guy. His direction here is overblown and lethargic, things that he very cleverly avoided previously. 'War...' is big on the spectacle and looks mighty impressive, but is one of those big and noisy films that forgets to properly tell a story or do anything with most of the characters. It also feels heavy-handed in its portrayal of fascism and slavery. One gets what the war of the title is referring to, but with only the characterisation of the apes working the tension and conflict just doesn't work.All in all, looks amazing but not the sort of film that makes one think or treat its audience with respect and it is severely lacking in heart and soul. 5/10 Bethany Cox","

"Sparse","27 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes isn't the masterpiece I hoped it'd be. As someone deeply invested in the characters however, it's still a highly satisfying, emotionally- profound final chapter for the trilogy. War also compensates for its relative lack of allegory/social commentary with an intricately complex (and rather poetic) character/story structure, adding new merits to the franchise even if dissatisfying others. I've been studying/writing about the entire Planet of the Apes franchise for the month leading up to my first viewing of War. Down the line (probably when the director's commentary comes out), I'll revisit my thoughts. For now, here are my impressions.Matt Reeves returns from Dawn with equitable ambition, making this the best-directed of the trilogy, addressing all of my primary issues from the previous film. Most notably, the pacing is better than Dawn's, with the emotional core always at the forefront and never sidelined. This film still doesn't have the unrelenting momentum of Rise, but it never dragged for me, and felt shorter than 2 hours (as opposed to the 2+ hour runtime). This was enhanced by the riveting (but admittedly sparse) action sequences, especially one not far into the film, which had me on edge. The sense of scope was far more realized in this film, venturing through different landscapes while not feeling claustrophobic, and implying a massive new world of unknown territory. Overall this was an ambitious film, but it didn't innovate from Dawn as Dawn innovated from Rise- -at the time shooting in the mud and rain, now opting for a tamer, snowy environment.Visually, this is nothing short of a spectacle. The (borderline R-rated) Holocaust imagery is genuinely haunting and unsettling, and crafts a unique tone with the sci-fi premise. Chinlund's production design is more enthralling than Dawn's, even if more greenscreen was used to get the result, contradicting the ambitious physical sets from before. The cinematography by Seresin also improves here, achieving some rather interesting shots, if still less engaging than the symbolic photography from Rise. As for the CG, I'm blown away. As good as the previous films were, there were still moments in which the effects were noticeably computer-generated. In War. . . the effects are flawless--so seamless that I never once actually saw ""CGI"". The effects in here are no less than groundbreaking. Spectacle isn't everything though, as there were various, smaller directorial flaws woven throughout.For one, the title card didn't match the style of the first two films, and the highlights of the former films' titles felt shoehorned-in. Also consider the distracting Coke truck in the middle of nowhere, and the ridiculously thin layers of snow covering the tunnels. How much effort would it have taken to show the characters digging or mining through stone? I can mostly excuse these smaller flaws on merits of the meticulously- crafted story.This is the sole film of the trilogy which wasn't written or adapted from a draft by Rick Jaffa/Amanda Silver, who retrospectively had a better understanding of the franchise's allegorical implications than Reeves/Bomback (who wrote this film). Now, Reeves knows how to create a brilliantly-layered story (not sure about Bomback), but his efforts left much to be desired in the way of commentary/allegory. There are clear (and often brutal) allusions to the Holocaust, with depictions of scapegoating minorities for predicaments the accuser is guilty of. In the way of contemporary commentary, the humans are trying to build a wall which ultimately proves useless (remind you of anything?). All in all though, it doesn't reflect the series' core allegory of racism very well, presenting nothing especially insightful or impressive. The final culprits are a handful of ""Did they really just do that?"" plot conveniences, mainly the tunnels with conveniently placed holes, but where the writing actually thrives in this film is structure.In War, we're presented with an abundance of reversals/reflections on the former films' themes. Consider that for the first time since Rise, Caesar finds himself in a cage and inciting a revolution. We also see him abused with water, and fed slop. Also consider the dramatic irony/poetic justice of the virus: designed by humans, activating the speech centers/enhancing intelligence for apes, now doing the precise opposite for humans, effectively switching their roles in a quite literal interpretation of Planet of the Apes' core reversal. Additionally, Alpha Omega isn't just an easter egg--it's about this film as the end of a trilogy and the beginning of a vast mythology, accentuating the motifs within the film.Character structure in War is also impressive. For example, Caesar kills Nova's father. This draws a parallel between Caesar and the Colonel (who previously killed Caesar's family). This turn not only reflects Caesar's disillusionment with humanity, but incites another parallel with his former opponent, Koba. Note that the now-orphaned Nova is a reflection of young Caesar, growing up and learning to sign with the reverse species. The performances are strong all-around, and there's not much new to be said (also I'm butting heads with IMDb's word limit). I'll add that I really enjoyed the tragic/comedic character of Bad Ape, and that Serkis was brilliant yet again.I still find Doyle's score for Rise to be the best of the trilogy, but Giacchino manages a noticeable improvement from his work on Dawn. Though still simple in orchestration, the music feels far more realized/developed here, and some nice new themes are added to the fold. I would have liked to hear more Goldsmith sensibilities (and Doyle's themes), but what we got was fantastic nonetheless.Not long after screening this film, I wanted to watch it again. Had this movie integrated more intelligent commentary and allegorical content, this could have been the second masterpiece within the Apes franchise, next to the 1968 film. I just hope that Fox keeps their damn dirty paws off my Apes until there's another story worth telling.Score: 9/10","

"tmaria1","3 December 2017","As much as I liked this trilogy and this movie I really wish they would lean more towards getting us closer in time to the original 1968 version. I understand these are prequels but if they are going to continue with these then I suggest fast forwarding a thousand years or more to just before when Heston arrives in the original 1968 classic. War was a good movie. I truly liked everything about it. I see the humans turning mute setting us up for the future. What I really want to see next is what caused the future nuclear holocaust? Show me what went on in the forbidden zone prior to Heston and crew arriving. Show us how the mutants from Beneath the Planet of the Apes came to be. If the ending of this movie was a foreshadowing of the lake that Heston crash lands in then we are going to have a problem. Remember he landed outside of New York City not over the mountains near California. Perhaps another trilogy can tie up these loose ends.","

"KOOLAIDBRO","15 October 2017","I am only reviewing this because I am surprised at all the bad reviews for this movie. I loved it and found it to be a great ending to a great trilogy. It's not as good as dawn of the planet of apes, but it is good. Dawn is the empire strikes back of the franchise. It's really good none the less. It pulls on every heart string. There was times I yelled out something I can not say on here from anger. There was times I felt redemption. It's kind of like watching game of thrones. Anyways do not listen to the hate for this movie. It's not action packed and it's not all happy. If that's what you want do not watch, but if you like a great story and a movie that takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride then watch it!","

"iamjacksmoviechannel","11 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes, the third film in what I would call a classic trilogy, probably the best all-around set of three we've gotten in the 21st Century, hands down. This is why we go to the movies. In 2011 no one was expecting much from another Planet of the Apes movie, especially after the Tim Burton debacle 10 years before it. But we came away from it not only entertained, but with a feeling that we just watched an iconic character being born. Caesar will be to apes what Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine and right now both are looking like Oscar contenders, finally. Both characters are also involved in a war of another's making, also against humans. Caesar has agreed that those in his tribe must go to higher ground for their own protection and he even stays behind to lead the military away from the rest of them. This is a Caesar we've seen go from innocent child to cruelly-treated animal to fair and peaceful leader to the regrettable warrior he's had to become because Koba, the ape he trusted, threw him back into this fight. He wanted nothing more than protection for his family and tribe. Anyone who thinks Andy Serkis isn't doing some of the best acting they've ever seen here has no idea what acting even is. The ape-body movements have almost become second nature now to the severe emotions of guilt and anger that Caesar is going through. Serkis is bringing all that out and no, if he does win something that doesn't mean that he has to bring all the visual effects people up with him. Did Daniel Day Lewis have to bring up the make-up people when he won for ""Lincoln""? No. Why is this any different? The motion- capture performer needs to be recognized, and there has been no better than Serkis. I also love that Caesar is also fighting this final battle here and his same brothers who helped him escape captivity in the first film voluntarily are right along with him for this. It has a ""Saving Private Ryan""/ ""Band of Brothers"" type vibe, and this is not the only time i'll be making reference to other war films throughout this review. But yeah these are a lovable and gentle group of 5 apes, so chill and laid back but willing to do anything for Caesar and that is really cool and really touching, particularly the relationship between Caesar and Maurice. Steve Zahn also joined the pack as a comic relief ape who sorta reminded me a bit of Dobby, but he's OK. And remember I told you I would be making more references to war movies? Well Woody Harrelson's villain is a brilliantly conceived psychopath who definitely compares to a classic character from film history, but I won't say who for fear of giving too much away. But I will say Harrelson is perfect for something like this and is the best villain this summer so far. A major amount of credit should be given to director Matt Reeves, and screenwriters Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver, least of which for making an ape riding on horseback so much cooler, and less stupid, with each passing movie. The fact that Reeves is going to be directing the next Batman movie is particularly interesting to me because the guy doesn't revel in violence in any way. His work on these Apes movies is of violence as a sad necessity. That's Caesar, and that's also more of a Batman people can get behind. Yes, battles bookend this film and there is also a pretty neat avalanche sequence towards the end but this is a summer blockbuster that doesn't feel the need to give us one over-the- top action sequence after the next and you know what, it proves that's OK. It has a somber tone but is never depressing. There's a great theme here linking consciousness and the darker parts of human nature, and the film runs the gamut of being heartbreaking, moving, suspenseful, and even inspiring. Yes, Caesar being tied to a cross in one scene is a bit on the nose as far as symbolism, but he's earned it. Lastly, Michael Giacchino's musical score just sends this finale of Caesar's saga off right. The whole series has just been outstanding. This is what happens when you devote efforts to the here and now rather than to some distant universe (looking at you The Mummy) and on making sure plot threads make sense and have purpose (looking at you Transformers). It's also what happens when your lead actor is fantastic, when the heart is in the right place, when the goal is the make something that stands the test of time and that will make people want to automatically want to go back to it and say that was one hell of a hero that series created. If you know me, you know I don't usually overstate things but this is a classic up there with Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Nolan's Batman trilogy. Add it to the last.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.","

"Abranth-d","19 July 2019","Here's my review of war for the planet of the apes . So once again Andy Serkis is back as Ceasar and he nails the role . The story is set right where Dawn left off , and despite being a very slow plotline , it still manages to keep you hooked. There is a lot of emotional scenes in this movie and Caesar faces too much tragedy like never before , but a better music score would've given a drive to the emotional scenes. The action scenes had less screen time than the prequels , but had , better CGI and choreography. Woody Harrelson was great as the bad guy , and his arguement with Caesar raises a lot of philosophical questions. The best thing about this movie is that it makes you root for the apes even though you're Human. In the end , "" war "" is an ape-tastic movie with ape-tacular action , great characters , a very slow plotline and a perfect end to a perfect trilogy.","

The pacing is perfect, the score is phenomenal, and the CGI is out of this world. You can't give the special effects team enough credit, what they've done for this film is truly magnificent. Andy Serkis is oustanding as Caesar and I'm fully aboard the Oscar train! Woody Harrelson plays a great villain and is owner of the one and only expositional scene in the film.

Yes, this is the best film of the franchise to me, helped by CGI effects at their peak. But there is no real surprise, if you already know the American blockbusters for over 13. I particularely noticed Woody Harrelson in colonel Kurz like character, of course a tribute to APOCALYPSE NOW's character played by Marlon Brando. The tribute is so obvious when we see this secluded colonel, commander in chief of an army of mercenaries, shaving his head with a razor and talking in some enigmatic manner with his visitors in his.dark room. No one seems to have noticed this tribute, but I have not read all the comments, more than nine hundreds.","

"cdjh-81125","6 August 2017","Before this trilogy came around I never really considered myself to be a Planet of The Apes fan but the trilogy has reinvested this franchise by being incredibly thought provoking as well as entertaining. Not only that but every entry in this trilogy has gotten considerably better than the last and War For The Planet of The Apes continued this tradition. The first and foremost thing to talk about with this film is Andy Serkis, when the first Oscar for a motion capture performance is given out he will be the one to receive it, he was truly amazing in this movie, he portrays Caesar in much darker and more bloody thirsty way in this film than he did the last two and pulls it off with style. Every motion-capture performance in this film is nothing less than exceptional, they feel like they are supposed to; like real walking, talking Apes and there is never a moment where you don't believe that they are. I have always loved Woody Harrelson and was very excited to see what he was going to bring to this character when given the opportunity to flex his villainous muscles. He absolutely nailed it, he was fantastic as the Colonel he brought a lot of strength to this character but also a lot of vulnerability and fear that he shows in his characters quieter scenes. It's also great that the writing for his character was very good, you come to understand his motivations for his actions which is always a necessity but I could see plenty of people agreeing with him, maybe not some of his actions but his reasoning itself is not entirely wrong. I loved that this film, like the past two before it, was not afraid to go to darker places when it needed to but neither Rise or Dawn went to the places that this film did. It almost felt like a holocaust movie at times with a lot of oppressive and fearful imagery that show that these films are not just blockbuster entertainment but serious, substance filled dramas that force there viewers to think while watching them. Matt Reeves was the perfect director for this film as well as Dawn, no disrespect to Rupert Wyatt, the director of Rise but I could not imagine anyone else nailing the direction of this film like he has. This film isn't as action-packed as one might expect but when it is he shows it in all its chaotic glory, never shying away from darker images that show the war in this film for what it is: needless violence. He's also excellent at framing that tell you a lot with single images. I have no issues with the fact this film chose not to be a non stop action experience but at the same time I do wish that this film would live up to its title more. I wanted to more see the scale and consequences of this conflict more but that is only truly shown in the first 20-30 minutes before Caesar sets out on his personal quest that was a great arc for this film but I do wish more time had been put into the conflict just to better show how much Caesar and his apes hated it and wanted to see it come to an end. War For The Planet of The Apes exceeded all my expectations, while it's not a war movie like the title would have you believe it's a much more heart felt and deeper Movie that asks questions of its audience. It has immaculate direction, framing and editing, a truly fantastic villain that plays perfectly of Caesar and another stunning performance from Andy Serkis that proves he has range like no other actor working today. 9.2/10-A (Phenomenal)","

"bob the moo","12 November 2017","Unsurprisingly the third part in this second reboot of the franchise was one of the big films this summer. In being so, it has it deliver in the scale of a blockbuster and in this way it certainly does. The jumps in technology over just the last decade is there on the screen to be seen, and it is consistently impressive regardless of the specifics of the shot. The large battle sequences and wide shots are the obvious examples, but in the close-up and expressions of the main characters is where you will be most impressed with what is possible now.The scale of the technology is one thing, but the other element is the scale of the story. On one hand it is expansive, but on the other it makes it a personal and small in its focus on the two main protagonists. This allows a lot of internal drama to play out, particularly in Caesar. Mostly this works well enough to support the blockbuster and stop it feeling like an expensive video game, but that is not to say that it always manages to make it work. There is conflict, inner turmoil, and some character, but it doesn't transform the film or elevate it significantly above the level of still being a pretty function (and good) blockbuster. Within the writing there is still a lot of convenience, a lot of artificial construction, and many fairly obvious narrative arcs. They all engage and do the job, but they don't stand up to reflection or turn the film into something smarter or deeper. The ending, meanwhile, feels dropped in from a totally different film, but yet obvious and clunky at the same time.As a blockbuster, it has plenty to enjoy and to make it stand out from the pack, but at the same time the epic scale doesn't justify the length, and the content is not as sharp or engaging as it suggests.","

I found the original (in this genre's reboot) to be better than the original, but found its sequel to be simply boring, overrated, and almost unwatchable. And then, there's the third installment.I cannot believe how involved I became in this film. I found the writing, the story, the pace, the directing--everything--to be leaps and bounds above the other two films. The casting for this film was perfect. What really blew me away, though, was the actual story. Everything is tied up and all questions answered in the third chapter. What's even more amazing is it all makes sense! When the film opens, the humans are trying to flush out Caesar and his minions. After years of battle, it seems a certain faction of the humans have found a Messiah; someone who will lead them to the retaking of their land. Known only as ""The Colonel,"" and delightfully portrayed by Woody Harrellson, I cannot think of too many characters on film I have despised more. On his way in search of The Colonel, Caesar begins to discover something may not be right in the community of humans.Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and torture, this is one of the best films of this year. I highly recommend it.","

But he won't accompany them until he kills the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) who killed his wife and son.This is nothing short of a masterpiece and I don't say that lightly. The acting, stunts, CGI and cinematography are all outstanding. Two things: Andy Serkis must be nominated for Best Actor and, of course, so should Woody Harrelson as anytime he is in a movie, the Academy should automatically award him a Best Actor Award as he is that good whether in a comedy or in a drama. And, yes, the movie itself should be nominated for Best Picture and the Director for Best Director. Hey, this is an epic movie and the music says so too. So there!This is not all Ape against Ape and the Army. Well, it is but the fighting is not as prevalent as most would think. The powers that be saw that constant fighting is not the answer to a good movie. And so it is. A breath of fresh air is the little girl (Amiah Miller) Caesar finds on his way to find the Colonel. She is named Nova after a Chevy Nova logo. She doesn't talk and we don't know the reason for that. Caesar's men shot dead her father or her guardian as we don't know exactly who he was. A very strange scene has her looking at her dead father or guardian with no emotion at all. However, later on she will get to you and you may need that box of Kleenex. A sort of comic relief is Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) who is against any decision by Caesar and his men, but eventually he always gives in. His scenes would have been funnier had the Director stretched out his misgivings because he was that good. Ah, well, we can't have everything. The supporting cast is impeccable. Maurice (Karin Konoval) is Caesar's chief confidant; Red Donkey (Ty Olsson) is a chief enforcer for the Colonel; and Toby Kebbel as Koba who is only seen in Caesar's visions or dreams – if you remember, Koba is the more aggressive Ape who was constantly against Caesar.

"NormanCroucher","9 October 2017","The new 'Planet of the Apes' franchise has been an unexpected and surprising success, easily equaling the quality of its iconic ancestral lineage, or even arguably surpassing it. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' was always going to be a tough act to follow but thankfully 'War' bucks the trilogy trend of the third film often being a lesser installment. It's not as well executed or as well structured as 'Dawn', but it's an excellent film nonetheless and builds upon an already rich mythology that offers up an elaborate explanation as to how Charlton Heston came back from space to find himself on a damn monkey planet.Matt Reeves returns for directing duties and recaptures the same foreboding and tension he evoked the last time around. This is a very downbeat and bleak movie, so much so I actually had to remind myself that this is a summer blockbuster produced and released by 20th Century Fox. It's incredible to think that something as dark as this can still sneak under the wire and into the mainstream, and we should all be thankful of that fact. Andy Serkis has graduated across the series from being the plot device of 'Rise', to the dual protagonist of 'Dawn', to the full-on lead character of 'War', and his motion captured performance is truly remarkable. You can even tell it's his face at certain points - a sneer here, a frown there - and I fully believe this performance should qualify him for an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor. He's the crown jewel of this franchise and he leads the charge from beginning to end this time around. I also have to make room for Steve Zahn's performance as a newly introduced ape, who is about the closest thing to a comic relief this film gets and his comic timing and tender eccentricity allows some breathing room between all the doom and gloom. The crowning achievement of this trilogy is its ability to seamlessly blend technological craft with human artistry. I have always favoured practical effects over CGI, but my god, even I can't deny just how magnificent the visual effects are. This is as close to photo- real you will see.The title of the film is somewhat of a mislead since it's a much smaller and more intimate story this time around, and I feel there was more of an epic war taking place in 'Dawn'. This is much more of a revenge tale, framed through the eyes of our protagonist Caesar, who we have seen grow up and mature into a leader across the two previous films, which lends a greater sense of dimension and complexity to his character. Watching him and his clan strike back against the remnants of the human race becomes an interesting exercise for us. As human beings we are naturally predisposed to the survival of our species, even in fiction, and usually films set in a post-apocalyptic world tend to lean heavily towards that as the goal. The 'Apes' films ask us to do something else - they ask us to root AGAINST the human race, and that does create a conflict within us as viewers. Not all humans are bad, and we know where this story is taking us once you factor in 'Planet of the Apes' 1968, yet at the same time these apes are every bit as complex and fallible and heroic and dangerous as we are. They have an equal right to live and build a future together. And while this film definitely comes down on the side of the apes, unlike 'Dawn' which showed the failings of both sides to make peace, it is a strange experience rooting for them to win this time around since there are no real human allies like James Franco or Jason Clarke's characters. In any other film, the apes would be the villains and Woody Harrelson's Colonel character makes a good case as to why he sees it that way, even though the filmmakers jettison his humanity in order to paint him as a more out-and-out villain. After all, we, the audience, have to be on side come the finale, especially come the arrival of an unexpected deus ex machina.This has been an intelligent and emotionally and morally complex series of films that have raised interesting questions about animal rights, speciesism, societal hierarchies, leadership and subservience, communication, conflict and peace. They are not simply mindless sci- fi movies cashing in on an existing property. Both of the previous films have been deeply thoughtful explorations of those aforementioned themes and ideas. So I am very pleased to report that 'War for the Planet of the Apes' proudly carries that torch all the way through to its beautifully biblical final moments.","

Using these Fires the Enemy is trapped like in a trash compacter, with the Fires behind, to the flanks of the Enemy, with the Fires behind the Enemy preventing Resupply or Reinforcements (Ape Cavalry would have become horse meat dog food), the Fires behind the Enemy moves closer forcing the Enemy to leave their Defensive Positions and attack U.S. Military Machinegun fortifications and defensive positions, result the Enemy gets slaughtered.Humans have had Thousands of Years to develop the Art of War, the Apes nothing, yet the Movie Writers make the Apes appear to have Graduate from U.S. Military War College.Woody Harrelson, needs to go back to doing what he did best, that innocent ignorant Cheers Employee, not a Colonel, U.S. Military routinely does Psychological Exams, Woody Harrelson would have never made it from O-1 (Second Lieutenant) to O-2 (First Lieutenant) with all the blunders he made.The Authors need to stop using the successful Anti War movie Apocalypse Now 1979 as a template, and get creative with their own ideas.

"purveshgholap","11 September 2019","War for the planet of the apes is the third installment to the trilogy, the previous two films have been amazing. Rise of the planet of the apes was pretty underrated for what it delivered, didn't got the enough recognition it deserved nonetheless it was a great watch. Dawn of the planet of the apes was a fantastic sequel it was pretty dark in its tone, however the story telling was on point and the characters were memorable. The first ape film which is rise was about ceaser character about his origin or where he belonged, the second ape film which was dawn is about ceaser leading the pack of apes, where humanity has gotten extinct due to their own hunger of power of science and technology, and third film focuses on ceaser's journey where he is dealing with the toughest time of his life, which will lead him either to his death or salvation.
War for the planet of the apes is an excellent third installment to what has become one of the greatest trilogy of all time, this movie is emotionally powerful. In this movie ceaser is the most broken, the most vulnerable and is also filled with lot of hatred, the guilt of losing the people he couldn't protect, his journey has been explored so perfectly where you see a great character development in him. Matt reeves has returned to direct the third installment, he did a great job with Dawn and has done a fabulous job with war.
This is one of the best visual story telling movie I've seen, the CGI of the apes has just gotten better over the years, in war the level of details in these characters is just fantastic, they look very photo realistic, the CGI has been done by some very talented people who deserves a pat on their shoulders, the cinematography is also brilliant as some of those shots look very beautiful.
Andy serkis has definitely given an Oscar worthy performance here, in previous two movies he was amazing, but Andy serkis has never been this good in any movie that he has ever worked in, his character is just so broken so deep, his performance really makes you feel sad about him and even the supporting cast gave very satisfying performance. In this movie we get introduced to two new characters that is mute girl child (her name is not mentioned because that's a spoiler) and bad ape. The little girl in this movie who was mute for the entire film had to relied on her expressions to give a good performance, and she was great in this movie some of her moments with ceaser and Maurice were adorable, in this very dark story telling movie some of these sweet moments were a great addition, and the character of bad ape could have been a problem as his character is comedic, but he was handled very well, and some of his funny scenes were a nice touch of humour and really added something to the movie.
However, this movie did a false marketing, making people believe that the movie will be action packed buff, with its title war for the planet of the apes, many people that it would be action packed extravaganza, but it wasn't. This movie does have some of the actions scenes, but most of them were just in the beginning of the film, after that the film a deal dramatic story visaul story telling movie, it didn't hinder my experience as the story building and the character development of this movie was so great that at some levels this movie even exceeded my expectations, but that's isn't the case with everyone, as some people I know were disappointed due to lack of war type action scenes.
All and all I think war for the planet of the apes is a beautiful film and really closes the trilogy in the best way possible","

"grumpy-3","11 July 2017","thank God there is one franchise that has not let me down, the third in the apes films carries on what the previous two had done, which is to entertain, excite and move the audience. only pixar has managed to do this with non human main characters. Everything in War is beautiful done, dialogue, effects, photography, music and acting both simian and human. these films have been emotionally rewarding, making you care for the characters, without obvious bad guys, both sides have valid reasons for their actions, there is no black and white, but the grey inbetween as in real life. the work of andy serkis and the cgi guys just seems to be getting better and better, where now it is fully acceptable and believable that the apes are real, living, breathing and dying sentient beings. so far the film of the year.","

"jon.h.ochiai","16 July 2017","What is the nature of humanity? Is humanity being human? In the unspoken scene in Director Matt Reeves's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the mute blonde girl, played by amazing Amaih Miller, cries as she takes the cherry blossom flower from her hair and places upon the fallen ape, who sacrificed to save Simian messiah Caesar, played by powerful Andy Serkis. The cherry blossom was the gift of kindness from the Ape. No words are spoken as tears fall from the girl's eyes, and Michael Giacchino's eloquent score breaks our hearts. Humanity is valuing all life, and seeing the nobility in that life. That is the beauty of Writer and Director Matt Reeves's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"". His narrative imagery is pristine and bold. The movie opens in the misty forest as Special Forces commandos attack the outpost of Ape Leader Caesar. Caesar demonstrating his acute strategy defeats the soldiers. He sends a message to the survivors, ""I did not start this war"" In this final chapter of the trilogy, Caesar distinguishes himself as the brave merciful leader hoping to coexist with Man, who only seeks annihilation of the Apes. But Caesar suffers tragedy at the hands of the Colonel, played by charismatic manic Woody Harrelson. The Colonel is without mercy, and now the noble Caesar wants his revenge. The imagery of ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is stunning. Michael Seresin's cinematography is astounding. He opens with the misty forest weapons battle. The snowy prison compound run by the Colonel is austere and foreboding. He captures the freedom and spirit of our heroes as their horses gallop along the beach at sunset. The visual portraits give life to the poignant narrative written by Reeves and Mark Bomback. Andy Serkis is a wonder as Caesar. His performance is the masterful blend of CGI and powerful actor. We see the compassion, fear, and courage in Caesar's human eyes and gentle visage. As Caesar we believe in the humanity of his kind, and doubt our own. Caesar's defining other is Harrelson's Colonel, who embodies man's inhumanity to all. Harrelson's Colonel is a take on Colonel Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Heart of Darkness"". His madness is visceral. He tells Caesar of his own actions, ""You are taking this way too personal."" Reeves eloquently unveils the Colonel's own tragic irony. In the storyline, the Simian Virus mutates Apes with great intellect and speaking language. Conversely, the virus robs humans of speaking, and devolves them to the vastly primitive animal. Reeves brilliantly intertwines the captivating dialogue and sign language of the evolving Apes. This represents the new stage of evolution and the new order. However, even evolution meets with resistance, especially in the human concerns. Perhaps, mercy is the most profound distinction of humanity. Reeves powerfully explores this in ""War"". There is not black and white resolution in the gray nature of the world we live. I think Reeves spends a little too much time in the snowy Ape prison, time slowly ebbs there. However, ""War"" has distinct power and nobility. It's amazing that the story of evolving Apes inspire, and make us think about our own humanity. Have compassion and value all life. The Ape leader Caesar reminds of this, and so does Director Reeves. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the year's best. It makes us look into our very souls, as well.","

"alistairc_2000","14 July 2017","Pierre Boulle the French novelist wrote Planet of the Apes (Originally The Monkey Planet). A classic SF novel. In 1968 it was filmed and so started the cinematic journey which leads to this. I watched Battle for the Planet of the apes as a young man. I thought that this movie was going to be along the same lines as that movie. After all, all of the trailers pitch it as a war between the apes and man. I was really looking forward to it. I liked the last two movies. They were not as good as the original series but were still interesting SF movies in their own right. Also, everything has been better than the Tim Burton Planet of the apes.So I put on my 3d glasses and sat down in Wood Green London to watch the war that would change the face of the planet. So there is a brief skirmish. Then the head ape Corny (as the plot is) sets out to find those responsible for doing wrong to him (yawn). Bring on the WAR I thought. Then they ride around for a bit. Next, we get Escape from Colditz, the great escape or Prison Break. I am still waiting for the promised war. At that end, there is a battle. Not against the apes as they are all escaping. Though unfortunately none of them get on a motorcycle and try to jump over barriers.I walked out of the cinema and thought what a pile of dung.The 3d is pathetic. Really this is a movie that could have been good in 3d but wasn't. It is at least 40 minutes too long. Also, it is not the movie they promised. There are no wars in it. It is littered with mistakes. My favourite is the 350-pound gorilla on a horse. No, that horse would have been dead.Lastly and this is my normal grump. Why did it not say it was based on Planet of the apes by Pierre Boulle? No mention of him in this shamefully bad movie.I really wanted to like this movie. What I got was a movie that surpassed Burton's POTA's for the worst one in the series.","

"asb_deutsch","16 July 2017","Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the one of the big movie surprises for me of that year. With staggeringly good motion capture for the apes and a touching story of Caesar and Co. it was a classic. What made me not notice that the apes were CGI!Next in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", we are caught in the feelings of man and mammals- though good but took a backward step, making it a little ""dawn"" and more ""war"".Finally, in ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", we get a thought provoking ""emotional"" script than action. The movie goes deep in the characters, especially Caesar.How many trilogies end with a successful second sequel/ third installment? To my perception, only Toy Story 3 and Bourne Ultimatum fits the puzzle. The conclusion is much better than LoTR, The Hobbit (old- fashioned ending) and even The Dark Knight Rises (Incoherent ending; I hope Nolan finds better luck in Dunkirk!). War of the Planet of the Apes with Spider-man: Homecoming can be labeled as June's best popcorn flick- duo. Verdict- A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. If you have a nice narration, you don't need 3D at all, which many people are complaining! My significant digit score: 7.9/10","

"barbagvido","28 November 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a third movie in the new Planet of the Apes prequel series. It's once again directed by Matt Reeves who also directed the previous one and stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson and Steve Zahn as Caesar faces the humans once more.It's a very powerful movie. Very grim, very serious and it absolutely works. Since today almost every blockbuster we get is an action comedy, this felt very refreshing. Just like Dawn, this one has very powerful anti-war themes and some human nature allegories. That's what I love about these prequels. They took a familiar story and focused on its themes more than ever before in order to bring a powerful, emotional story. This one was more emotional than its predecessors, but I liked Dawn of the Planet of the Apes more because the story felt more complete. This one has a mostly pretty good story, but the character of a little girl Nova felt a bit shoehorned in since she served almost no purpose to the plot except showing the effects of a Simian flu on humans and one little bit at the end, but that's it. These may be valid enough reasons for some, but they weren't for me. Also, the pacing sometimes felt a bit off. Like they should have taken more time with the journey around the first half of the movie. It felt really rushed and some emotional moments should have been more of a punch. And then, when we get to this place they were heading for, it really slows down. I liked the Holocaust allegories and all, but as much as the imagery and brutality helped establish some things, the plot didn't go anywhere for a while. I didn't feel these things with Dawn and that's why I thought Dawn was perfect. But these flaws still don't prevent the movie from provoking emotions. This is one of the most emotional blockbusters I've seen. It really reduces the action until the very end and replaces it with a genuine, heartfelt war drama.It's a fitting and epic end to a great trilogy. While only a few flaws make it slightly pale when compared to its predecessor (but it's better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes), it's the most emotional one of the bunch.","

"arabnikita","15 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a deserving conclusion to an epic trilogy. This film in particular solidifies Caesar's place as one of the most interesting characters in film history. From the first film he is constantly going though an internal struggle between his Ape and Human sides and in this movie the weight that is on his shoulders really shows an effect on his spirit. Just to think about the journey he went through from the beginning is awe-inspiring.Andy Serkis might not get an Oscar that he deserves but he has established his place in history as one of the most talented and dedicated actors. Bravo Sir!!!My second nod, actually a bow, goes to Michael Giacchino, the composer of this movie who has done a monumental job with creating the music that takes you on an emotional journey that is the icing of this movie.P.S. One aspect this film does is that it neatly introduces humor in small portions which is used to add some brightness to the struggle that the characters go through. They did not overdo it and I would like to thank you for that.","

"ryzah","11 July 2017","I am a biased lover of 'Planet of the Apes'... Take these words with that it mind!This is without doubt, the best 'trilogy' of the 21st Century!From the opening scene, leading from a recap of past films in an imaginative and flowing manner, you are led back into this beloved new world along side friend or foe?! The ensuing drama that you are then taken along with, is breathtaking, shocking, brutal and Brave! Andy Serkis and the other Actors who have mastered this unbelievable technology are magnificent, the Visuals are stunning, the shocks are unbearable, gripping and wonderfully woven into the faultless story, that grabs you, holds you and then breaks you over and over again! Naivety aside, I understand a few issues may arise, such as 'Bad Ape', the Music being a little obvious, the Little girls reactions to a couple of dramatic scenes, however none are big enough to spoil in any way a quite remarkable end to a series that has become a huge hit. Ignore those reviews that typically focus on such minor detail.So, go back and watch the Rise and Dawn of the Apes if you haven't already done so; Grab snacks and drinks, Book the film in 3D, ""Shut off from the outside world"" as 'VUE' states and witness a Masterpiece.","

"FlashCallahan","12 July 2017","Caesar is forced into a deadly conflict with a ruthless colonel, after his eldest son and wife are slaughtered. After unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker side and begins his own quest to avenge his kind. As his journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in a battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet..........First off, anyone who wants to use the term 'Ape-pocalypse Now', don't bother, it's literally used in the film.And what a film. After a plethora of worthless 'blockbusters' released this year, this treats the audience like they have a brain, rather than having the script spout Basil Exposition every three minutes.And as for the script, there are large portions of the film where there is no dialogue, we just focus on Caesar and his journey. But in these sections, dialogue isn't really needed, we can see the pain in Caesars face and gait, and it carries the narrative far more than having dialogue for the sake of it.The film is technically brilliant, the apes are so lifelike, you forget that the are nothing more than actors in 'Running Man' jump suits covered in mini ping pong balls. And if this film doesn't win a plethora of awards, there is something wrong with the planet (of the apes).Serkis is perfect as Caesar, show more human emotion than any of the human characters, his journey is a long and painful one, and I know the air conditioning was on, but I felt really cold during the second and final act.Harrelson as the Colonel, does have similarities to Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, but he is more similar to Barnes from Platoon, as he has method in his madness, and one prolonged scene between him and Caesar is touching as well as sinister, him explaining the reasoning of why he is doing what he's doing.Talking about similarities, whilst watching this, I was reminded of several films. The Revenant, Deliverance, Saving Private Ryan, Temple Of Doom, The Last Castle, and even Braveheart, but I wasn't longing to see any of these films because I was fully involved in this from beginning to end.Zahn is a welcome addition as 'Bad Ape' and even if the film is very serious, he provides a lot of laugh out loud moments.It's a real big thing to say, but in my opinion, it's the perfect live action trilogy, the film film ends perfectly, they couldn't have done anything else to make it better.Bookended with two wonderfully crafted set pieces, WFTPOTA (which no one is calling it) could be one of the films of the year. The film making is so perfect, you forget you are watching a film where 80 percent of the characters are CGI.Full of metaphorical references to apartheid, Slavery, and nature versus nurture, the film is epic on a momentous scale. It's thrilling from beginning to end.Quite wonderful.","

"danielharden","30 July 2017","The Planet of the Apes franchise is no stranger to remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels and literally every kind of incarnation or adaptation a film franchise can have. Back in the late 60's, early 70's we got the original film, plus several sequels, then in 2001 we got whatever the hell Tim Burton made, and then in 2011, Rise of the Planet of the Apes started, what is by far the best prequel series ever, and has thus far been, one of cinema's greatest all time film trilogies. 2017 marks the end of this prequel series with the release of War for the Planet of the Apes, The third and final film in this phenomenal series and yet again Matt Reeves strikes gold.What is by far the films greatest strength, is its depiction of war. The film creates a very realistic representation of what a war is like. There are multiple different battles going on, between opposing sides and within the same sides. Apes clash with apes and humans clash with humans, the film doesn't depict a black and white version of a war, it knows war is more complex than that and respectably portrays this. The film also adds quite a lot of depth, depicting characters inner conflicts rather than just the physical ones seen in battle. This really added to Caesar's already established character and gives him even more of a character arc than he has already had. Not only does Caesar get added depth, but Woody Harrelson's Colonel is given a very intriguing and personal backstory. This really added to the films realistic presentation of a war, showing both sides as having their own inner struggles and presenting both as in some way human. This film packs an emotional punch which is surprising from a blockbuster franchise film, even if the last two films have been glorious.Matt Reeves excellently directs this film, depicting war realistically and respectably, while also making a nonstop, action packed movie that deals a great deal of emotional impact. War for the Planet of the Apes is extremely engaging and is an utter joy to watch, thanks to an action packed script and masterful directing, well done Matt Reeves. As well as Matt Reeves, Andy Serkis strikes gold once again as Caesar. The man is truly a pioneer of motion capture and a living acting legend because of it. The man plays Caesar again, but differently to how we have previously seen him. Serkis shines once again, nailing the deeper inner conflict of becoming Koba, consumed by hate, unable to forgive, as well as slipping back into the role of Caesar like a pair of comfortable shoes.To criticise this film is hard, the criticisms for this film fall into the nitpick domain of film criticism, but nonetheless I shall state them. The film is awfully predictable, but in all honesty, what do you expect from a blockbuster movie and franchise sequel? Most films can be predictable if you think hard enough. Also the human soldiers/security in this film are hilarious. In the latter part of the film, the human henchmen are used so conveniently to progress the plot, being so hilariously bad at their job. This does take away from the realism the film creates with its depiction of war, and occurs so frequently that it's comical. I constantly found myself thinking ""How have none of the humans seen this?"" and ""Are you seriously going to do that? You are a trained soldier!""To conclude, War for the Planet of the Apes is the ideal end for this fantastic film trilogy. Andy Serkis and Matt Reeves are phenomenal once again, one upping on their previous efforts. The film does have some dumb moments near the end to further the plot and is a bit predictable, but the realistic depiction of war and the brilliantly crafted, action packed movie, with an emotional motive, outshines all the criticisms or nitpicks with the film. Apes together strong!","

"williampsamuel","6 May 2020","You wouldn't expect pathos and deep personal drama from a movie about humans battling apes. In fact the trailers gave me the impression that this was where the series would go off the rails, replacing story and characters with explosions and effects. Thankfully I was very wrong. Beyond being an outstanding action blockbuster, War is a work of surprising complexity and depth, which successfully blends religious symbolism, painful imagery of slavery and genocide, and though provoking questions about the price of vengeance and what truly makes us human.For those who haven't seen the first two movies, it's been three years since conflict between the apes and the remnants of humanity began. In that time ape leader Caesar and his tribe have made every effort to avoid war, hiding ever deeper in the forests in the hope that they'll be left alone. In return they've been endlessly hounded by soldiers following the fanatical Colonel. Near the brink of destruction, Caesar decides the only hope for his beleaguered clan is to flee to a new land far away, while he deals with the Colonel once and for all. But of course the best laid plans of men and apes go astray, supping up a harrowing captivity and climactic final battle.Harrelson is in perfect form as the colonel, channeling Brando and adding his own natural insanity to create an antagonist very much like Col. Kurtz, only far more intense and aggressive. Personal loss and the fear of what humanity may become have driven him beyond the point of fanaticism, into utter ruthlessness and madness. He will use any means to achieve his ends; even killing his own men if he believes they pose a danger. His followers are as much a cult as an army, and he is like a prophet to them, preaching the gospel of salvation for humanity through the annihilation of the apes.Yet the Colonel is not the only flawed character in the movie. As Caesar continues on his quest, he's haunted by the memory of Koba, the villainous ape who started the war with humanity and died by Caesar's hand in the last film. Their clash came about because Caesar only wanted peace, while Koba was consumed by his thirst for revenge against the humans. But now as pursues his own vengeance, who must ask himself if he is becoming his old foe, and whether what he's doing is for the good of his tribe, or his own satisfaction.This question becomes more pressing as what was supposed to be a simple assassination becomes a rescue mission. Rather than kill all the apes immediately, the Colonel has imprisoned hundreds of them in what can only be described as a simian concentration camp where the captive apes are used a slave labor to build a wall that will complete the Colonel's defenses. The Holocaust imagery is striking and highly disquieting, especially in scenes where the captives are herded and beaten by fellow apes who are fighting for the humans. These ""Donkeys"" (presumably as in Kong) were followers of Koba, who fight for the promise that they will be spared, like Kapos in a Nazi concentration camp.These scenes are also unsettlingly similar to some from Roots and Twelve Years a Slave. It's a testament to the quality of the writing and direction that apes can be used as stand-ins for plantation slaves without it seeming even slightly racist. On the other hand the wall that the apes are building could be seen as an overly transparent political allegory, especially since it's at the border between two states. But then again it is a military fortification across the mouth of a box canyon; more like the wall at Helm's Deep than a monumental barrier to separate humans from apes. So make of it what you will.The apes meanwhile have their own human companion, a young mute girl they name Nova. Her presence is a fairly transparent ploy to make us relate to the protagonists, but it works, largely due to the young actress's wide facial acting range and sheer cuteness. And she may turn out to have more plot significance than we initially realize.Perhaps surprisingly for a movie this intense and frequently tragic, there is some excellent comedic relief, most of it delivered by Bad Ape, an escapee from a Florida Zoo who's gone a bit nutty from too many years of isolation. He's cowardly, eccentric, and always doing the wrong thing at the worst time possible, in the most endearing way possible. There's also something to be said for the mere presence of a mostly hairless ape in a ski vest.War for the Planet of the Apes delivers everything you could want from a summer action movie: great effects, spectacular battle scenes, frequent suspense, good comic relief, and even some smart pop-culture references. But more than that, it's a work of depth and nuance that will make you think, feel, and maybe bring an occasional tear to your eye. It ups the action and spectacle of its predecessors while remaining as thoughtful and character driven as ever, and is far more human than a movie about apes has any right to be.","

"nzswanny","24 July 2017","What makes War Of The Planet Of The Apes a masterpiece? Because it has some extremely well handled dramatic moments in it, boasting visually stunning cinematography and masterful acting to carry it off. War Of The Planet Of The Apes is not just about the horror about the battle of war, it's also about the revolutionary shouts from the people being affected by it, in this case the apes. It's an emotional roller- coaster, except instead of over-done sentimentality it displays raw emotion to get into the viewer watching the film. War Of The Planet Of The Apes, in my opinion, marks as the best of the Planet Of The Apes prequel trilogy and while it isn't as good as the 60's Planet Of The Apes it remains a boasting, powerful epic despite that, proudly declaring itself in pride. Listening to the film boom over the speakers of the cinema is incredible, and the experience for this film won't be the same if you just watch it on your TV...see it at the cinema before it's too late!","

"ferguson-6","11 July 2017","Greetings again from the darkness. Counting the original in 1968, this is the ninth Planet of the Apes film (sourced from the Pierre Boulle novel), and the third in the most recent reimagining – including Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). That's almost 50 years of talking apes questioning the role, purpose and intent of humans. Director Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) is back after 'Dawn' and clearly has an affinity for the characters and the continuing saga. This one is by far the most personal  if that's the right term when applied to a species other than persons! Opening with the film's best battle scene (and perhaps the most superb and vivid of the franchise); the film stuns us with the realism of apes on horseback and searing violence that rivals any war film. We are immediately drawn in by the thrilling and intimate battle scenes, and the accompanying adrenaline rush. It's a beautiful and heart-pounding opening that will surely satisfy even the most demanding action-oriented fans. This is also when we notice that Michael Giacchino's score as a complementary thing of beauty and not just more over-the-top action film music bravado.The great Andy Serkis returns as Caesar, the leader of the apes, and dare I say, one of the most exciting and dynamic recurring characters in the movie universe. This third film belongs to Caesar and we see his intelligence, personality and skills have evolved in each. His human nemesis this time is Woody Harrelson in Colonel Kurtz psycho-war lord mode. In the years since ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", a simian virus has wiped out much of the human race and now the last two human factions (one led by Harrelson) are preparing for a final epic war, while at the same time, all remaining humans are united against apes.Apes simply want to be left alone in the forest, but humans focused on their destruction are forcing the apes to fight. One particular attack causes Caesar to erupt in anger and strive for revenge, providing the foundation for a movie with less action than the previous two, and a more concerted focus on story and character. Some may be disappointed in this. Others (like me) will find it fascinating.Joining Serkis/Caesar for a third round are Terry Notary as Rocket and Karin Konoval as Maurice (orangutan). Also returning is Toby Kebbel as Koba – this time in a manner that really messes with Caesar's mind. Steve Zahn steals his scenes as the comedy relief chimp known only as ""bad ape"", with Judy Greer as Cornelia, and young Amiah Miller as Nova (same name as Linda Harrison in the original). Nova is a human girl who seems to fit much more with the apes than the warmongering humans. Fans of the original will also note Caesar's son is named Cornelius (the same as Roddy McDowell's ape in the original). Director Reeves delivers what would be a fitting end to a trilogy, but there is likely to be yet another if fans can appreciate that the series has evolved every bit as much as the apes.","

"elenaphysics","13 July 2017","OK , let us begin. This movie is not good. I enjoyed rise of the planet of the apes, I did not much enjoy the dawn of the planet of the Apes, but what I certainly did not like was this one. If you remove the nice cinematography, if you remove the apes and substitute them with people, do you know what you will see? You will see a bunch of movies you have already watched before. Nothing special. What really stuns me, are the weird religious symbolism in this movie.And also historical symbolism. They were not necessary , and took away the originality of the film. The whole thing with the Crucifixions. OK they were not crucified, they were tied with ropes on crosses, not making the + cross symbol but the x mark like a ''crux decussata'' of saint Andreas. Anyway, the military camp which becomes a concentration camp for the apes, where they are forced to work, looks so much like Auschwitz- Birkenau. The story of the Jews and the Holocost has been in so many movies, and Auschwitz holds a special place in those movies. Just , don't turn this movie in to a Holocaust movie. Where apes are the jews and the Nazi-like character of Colonel wants to exterminate them. The whole Nazi thing is prevalent in this movie. The way soldiers obey, the colonel shaving his head, the fact that he killed his son because after he got infected by the virus because he stopped being human (therefore pure like the Nazis wanted to be) The soldier whose live was spared, and seemed to respect Ceasar in a way, was the one who killed him. It was like an element of surprise ,but I have seen it in about 10 movies already. In the end Ceasar, as another Moses from the Bible, leads the Apes (jews) to the land of Canaan. I have watched Moses movies so many times. I do not want another Bible movie. Also the character of little zoo ape who could talk, was supposed to be funny. But it wasn't. Actually it reminded me of the lost and disoriented Gollum from the Lord of the Rings. Which can not be a coincidence, since Andy Serkis was actually the Gollum in those movies. Seriously the movie was bad. Don't watch it. But I am afraid the you will because everyone is tempted to watch the end of a trilogy.","

"saull28","9 October 2017","Is rare to see these days of special effects a movie well done, acted and with an interesting dramatic story, most sci-fi movies are 80% special effects, 5% whatever acting and 5% simple boring story, like Transformers and the like, GI-Joe and the like, but this trilogy had a consistent realism and story very close to the original '60s and '70s intention with only the necessary SFX, and this movie even had some good humor, it wasn't a senseless warmongering bunch of apes against another group but of humans, it was a realistic post-apocalyptic scenario with realistic circumstances and decisions; wasn't thought provoking because that wasn't the intention, the message was to tell the story of what happened in this alternative Universe where things resulted this way, everything was logical, interesting a few surprises and well delivered, not predictable most of it, that's why I don't understand the dislike, maybe they wanted to see a massive scale war with interesting battles and strategy well that isn't consistent with the previous 2 movies, or the trilogy story, so if you're stupid enough to not see this, that's your problem, go find simple and full of violence movie elsewhere you stupid ape","

"btkb","23 March 2020","These are all of the Planet of the Apes movies I watched. I hope these reviews are helpful. I have different tastes in movies, so you may not agree with me. Some are just stories about them, which may help you decide whether to watch it or not.Planet of the Apes (1968) - The ending was a surprise since it looks like the astronaut witnessed what the future will look like and all. The apes were pretty good. Of course, CGI did not exist, so they were in costumes. Overall, it was great.Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) - I was surprised another astronaut had arrived. Of course, he got the same treatment like the previous human did since apes saw humans as animals. Basically, both of these movies are reverse roles, where humans are apes, and apes are like humans. The ending was different since they meet some sort of telepathic humans who was going to set a bomb that would destroy the planet. It's pretty good movie!Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) - Two of the apes we saw in the first two movies who saved the humans had to escape from the planet since it was going to be destroyed. Of course, they went back in time. The roles are reversed again. This time, the humans are surprised to see the apes talking. Sadly, they both die, but gave birth to a son named Caesar. Well, the name was something else. The ending was sad since both of the baby ape's parents died since the man did not want them to soon rule the Earth. Here, you will see how the apes ruled the Earth in the future.Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) - Caesar is fully grown, but he has to pretend he is a slave ape like the others, and that he is not allowed to speak since they will capture him. Of course, the owner who protected and took care of him dies because he doesn't want to take Caesar to the police. You see that later, Caesar and the other apes have war against the humans who treated them badly. It's pretty intense.Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) - Apes have their own territory, and Caesar has his own family. Humans are getting along with them and helping them. Of course, they have rules there too. The ending becomes intense when apes are fighting with apes since some did not like Caesar ruling. Watch these original movies!Planet of the Apes (2001) - Similar to the first Planet of the Apes movie. The difference is that the CGI started improving to where they did not use humans to where costumes. The thing is, it was really different than the original. The astronaut lands on Earth, where apes rule the planet. But before that, him and his crew at his timeline, sent an ape in space as an experiment. Of course, the ape disappears into some sort of orbit or particles. The man goes to retrieve him back, but he gets sucked into it. There, he is sent to the future where apes are ruled. The story is the same as the original, but this time, the humans can talk in this one. The ape that he sent in his timeline, turns out to be the king or the ruler of the planet, where they respected him. After the battle ended to where they accepted the humans, the man goes back to his timeline. This got confusing. General Thade is an ape that wanted to kill the man when he was there. After he came back to his timeline, he looks up at what appears to be the Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade, who had later escaped, also traveled back in time through the same electromagnetic storm and conquered humanity. Leo is descended upon by a swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters, all of whom are apes. It seems they wanted to make a sequel of this, but I guess they haven't. I do not blame for having low ratings to this since the ending was confusing, or the movie and storylines were bad.Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - Completely different story to the first original one. This time, it is humans experimenting apes. The female ape goes berserk, and has to be taken down. They find out she is pregnant and gives birth. The baby ape is Caesar, who possesses human intelligence. The thing is, he later gets taken to the shelter along with other apes because of his immaturity or for what he has done to his neighbor for yelling at his owner's father. Nice of him to protect him. We then see Caesar becoming tougher since the guy in the shelter was being super mean to him. He then yells ""NO!"" which shocks the other apes and the man since he can talk. Of course, the battle between humans and apes starts. Best movie and special effects I have ever seen!Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) - We see the apes finding a colony. One of the ape, Koba, is different compared to Caesar when it comes to dealing with humans. He was abused by them, so we can see why he doesn't like them. Koba tries to kill Caesar for what he has decided. Caesar doesn't know this, and so, decided to attack him in the end because ""apes don't kill apes."" The problem with this was that Koba caused the apes to deal with more problems in the future since the man he negotiated with, had a friend who called in the military people about them. Caesar and the men told the humans that saved him to stay somewhere safe. Caesar and the other apes were preparing for the war against the military humans. This gets intense! Watch this movie!War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) - The title itself explains it all, along with the previous movie! The war is between the military army and apes. Throughout this movie, we see a sad scene where Caesar sees a Colonel killing his eldest son and his wife. He wanted revenge for what the Colonel has done. Of course, as he went, he gets captured at their base along with his other fellow apes. The Colonel explains about the simian flu his son had dealt with, and that he had lost his son because of the apes and their spread of disease. Later, with the help of a human child, who couldn't speak, along with another ape who could speak as well because he learned it by listening to the humans, help out the others, and got the apes to escape. Caesar was going to kill the Colonel, but he saw the Colonel having the simian flu as well. Instead, he left him to kill himself instead. Another army then comes who were after the Colonel and his men. Caesar blows up the base, along with that, was an avalanche which wiped out both of the armies. They, later, escaped, and they found a place where they can have peace. Sadly, Caesar dies because of his wounds and injuries. The girl stays with them. This movie is great! Best movie of all! Worth it!Watch all of it since I could be telling the story wrong!","

"nogodnomasters","30 July 2017","Minor mid plot explanation.The movie opens with a few written lines to recap the last film.The war consists of 5 different sides, similar to Syria with no real solution. Caesar (Andy Serkis) is the leader of the main ape group, protagonist, as he shows the most ""humanity."" The apes who started the war with the humans have now joined with the humans against Caesar, a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Humans are into three groups. The virus has caused a group of humans to become mute. They are pacifists and have moved to the country side. Woody Harrelson leads a second human group who wants to exterminate the virus infected mute humans and keeps apes as prisoners and slave labor. There is a third group of humans who don't want to kill the mutes, so they want to kill Woody's group. They don't like apes either.Woody Harrelson plays a serious role without his usual humor. There is plenty of homage paid to the original film which I loved, especially in the selection of names, ""Nova"" being the most obvious. The X frames on which apes were hung and the marching army reminded me of the original film. Steve Zahn as ""Bad Ape"" reminded my of Golem....sorry guys wrong film. It seems they were attempting to create a film that could tie into the original masterpiece if we would substitute a virus for an atomic bomb.Better than I expected.","

"DHWaldron","11 August 2017","The movie truly delves into the quote of ""Ape shall not kill ape"", as we see Caesar slowly transgressing into the cloud of darkness, and abandoning all of his ambitions and love. Caesar is haunted by the memory of Koba and the quote previously mentioned, and, as the movie progresses, Caesar's love of humans dies along with his family and other apes, making him become similar to Koba. Throughout the movie, the audience soon realises that the movies are not about ""The Planet of the Apes"" anymore, but about a deeper issue of Caesar and his character's mind and thoughts. And, even Caesar seems to value his personal quests rather than the larger goal.The setting and photography are magnificent, making it hard to tell what is CGIed and what isn't. But, without the perfect visual effects, the movie would not have half the impact it had, with every single hair being done to precise measurement, you can even see the graying of Caesar's hair as he grows old and weary, with the tips tinged with white to represent the snow and ice forming on his body. Gunshots seem realistic and wrinkles on the apes give perfect contrast to the precise detail and architecture of their face. You can even notice the bags under their eyes! But, being a dedicated fan, as most who see this movie are, the tie-ins and 'nods' to the original ""Planet of the Apes"" are natural, unforced tie-ins, adding to the experience as a fan even more-so than a new customer to the ""Apes"" franchise.Easily being one of the best ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, this does not disappoint, whether you are in search of action, vendetta, emotional drama or just to the see sequel to ""Dawn"". The darkest and most tempting movie in the franchise: ""War for the Planet of the Apes"".","

"inforaza","22 July 2017","If you've not seen War of the Planet of Apes, here's a Warning: THERE IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! What exist are just skirmishes between humans and the imprisoned apes who were trying to escape.In fact, it is a FLOP movie! Only 15 people were watching the show.The first 75% of the movie is very, very slow and the movie is 30 minutes too long (actual length is 2hr 20 mins). This is because the story-writer hopelessly failed to think of ways to add Thrill and a real War – but, instead, made the plot move at a snails' pace just to elongate the movie time.In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes. Not a second more.The movie ends in an ""unconvincing"" manner: One military faction is eliminated by another military group. And this group is eliminated by a roaring Avalanche. This helps the apes to escape to the dessert they were planning to relocate on.NOTE: The Avalanche was created because the story-writer could not think of a way for the apes to attack and defeat the military faction. How Convenient! LOL! The only great thing about this movie is the CGI which makes the apes look 100% realistic. The Avalanche too looks realistic. The visuals and cinematography is great.WPA is an extremely ""unconvincing"" end to a trilogy whose first 2 episodes are just Moving & Thrilling – which touched your heart and mind. They made you feel for each of the characters.I feel like giving TIGHT SLAPS across the faces of Writers Matt Reeves and Mark Bomback, just as I felt like giving the same to Roland Emmerich for Independence Day 2.","

"regula1","13 July 2017","Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar.There's no getting around the power of his performance in this, the conclusion of the prequel Apes trilogy of films. In Rise, he portrayed the character of Caesar as a fast-maturing ape who was learning to grapple with his human side. In Dawn, we say that humanity firmly take hold after what was left of his peaceful ape habits began to fade.Now, in War, like Darth Vader, his goodness is in constant battle with his darker side, and the result is at times chilling but also heart- warming to see the good shine through once again.This Apes film is unique in the prequel trilogy as it mostly centers on the plight of the apes rather than the humans. In the previous two, we saw humanity as being on the short stick of its own arrogance, and the survivors learned to co-exist.Now, humans are shown through the lens of warriors only, specifically that of the Colonel played by Woody Harrelson. While his subordinates get the obligatory expendable-soldier treatment, the Colonel is a far more complex character who, while you condemn his actions, you understand his motivations, truly the kind of villain that good writing is capable of bringing to the screen.On the Apes side, with the exception of a couple of expendable characters with little to say about them, all of the characters we are introduced to are well fleshed-out and have interactions that contribute to the plot without needless exposition, the way it should be done.If there are any faults to this film, aside from its length, which by the end did start to feel it once the action ended, there were the references to the original Planet of the Apes. Up front, there are three obvious ones, and of these two are very in-your-face and after the initial reference are said again and again to point it is distracting, but in a movie such as this these are minor gripes.The original sequels to the original Planet of the Apes were less than stellar, but this capping-off of this prequel trilogy is up there as almost matching the quality of the original, sure to be remembered as a classic in the years to come.","

"EasternZZ","22 March 2018","You saw the trailers, you were expecting this to be as awesome as Dawn and Rise, but the truth is this movie takes such a completely different tone that it just leaves you wanting to go back and watch Dawn and Rise again.~The biggest problem with this movie is the LACK OF ACTION. This movie barely has any action. The trailers and the title was hinting at a giant epic battle but in reality it is actually really small and it only lasts for about 5 minutes at the end.~The story started off great but halfway through, it suddenly become ""12 Years a Slave"" mixed with ""Passion of the Christ"" mixed with ""Schindler's List"" mixed with ""The Great Escape."" The second half drags on and on forever. It is extremely slow and they spent at least 45-60 minutes in this prison camp. There is only so much you can watch an ape get whipped and tortured before you end up getting bored.~The way the filmmakers decided to end the big battle at the end is a giant cop out. Throughout the movie they hint at a giant mass army of men who will come and attack. When the time does come, OUT OF NOWHERE an avalanche comes and ends the battle. It is one of the worst cop outs I have ever seen honestly.+) Andy is great as always, same with all of the character actors.+) Woody Harrison is great as always, but they end his story arc so sudden and it really leaves you empty inside.Overall I guess if you are a huge fan of Rise and Dawn (Like me, I saw Dawn 3x in theaters), you will want to see how they end Ceasar's arc. You will leave a little disappointed at the lost potential that a movie call ""WAR for the planet of the apes"" could have had. This is NOT a movie to watch at night with a group of friends while drinking and eating food. YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP during the second half.","

"851222","16 July 2017","Greetings from Lithuania.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017) is amazing movie. It perfectly ended this trilogy and left me wanting for more. I do hope they will create another trilogy this time focusing on humans, but seeing what incredible movies they made about apes, i want them to me great characters as well.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is easily one of the best movies i saw this year. The craftsmanship of this movie is nothing short of amazing. Special effects were simply flawless. Not great or amazing - they were perfect. Not for a second did i thought that i was watching CGI creations in front of me - they were there, apes, with all of emotions and etc. Andy Serkis is amazing in here. Steve Zahn stole every scene as a Bad Ape - couldn't take my eyes of him - what a movie magic. Screenplay was great, deep and dark - this is a dark movie and although it is rated PG-13 its theme is more in common with ""Apocalypse Now"" - starting from theme, mood and Woody Harrelson performance which more then once remanded me of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. Overall, once again - ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an amazing motion picture. There so many quite scenes between apes that i kinda wished they just kept going. Directing by Matt Reeves was more then great - he is truly a force in Hollywood that should be get more recognition - can't wait to see his take on solo ""Batman"" movie. Cant' recommend this movie any higher - great movie.","

"rs403404","29 July 2017","Remember when prequels were all the fad. ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was the first one to make a real impact. Since then we've had prequels to ""The Exorcist"", ""Alien"", ""X-Men"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""The Thing"", and even ""Dumb and Dumber"". Some are good, some not so much. However, they rarely outshine the original films that inspired them.That's where ""Planet of the Apes"" stands alone. Not only is the prequel trilogy a collection of three outstanding movies. They are also without a doubt the three best movies of the franchise. Further, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (yes, this trilogy is plagued with clumsy titles) might be the best of the bunch.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focuses largely on the human characters while ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" seemed to share screen time equally between human and apes characters. In ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the apes are very much the center of the story. Not all the apes can speak yet, so much of this plays almost like a multimillion dollar silent movie. Yet, at no point does the story ever feel like it's missing something. I have no idea what the budget of this film was, but the apes that are nearly omnipresent for the 140 minutes screen time look completely real.So far, all I've done is praise technical achievements. The story here is simple, Caesar (Andy Serkis) wants peace for the apes and wants to end the bloodshed between humans and apes. However, when a human Colonel (Woody Harrelson) attacks Caesar's family Caesar pursues the path of revenge and follows the footsteps of Koba (Toby Kebbell) from the previous movie. Despite the War in the title, this is all a very personal tale for Caesar and how his plight tells us if the apes are worthy of survival. In contrast we have the Colonel, whose plight is just as personal. Despite the fact that the Colonel is played very much as a villain, his reasons seem almost logical. He's fighting not just against the apes, but against fate. A fight he will do anything to win and his path will determine whether humanity is worthy of survival.To say more would be to reveal too much and rob you of the experience of this movie. Because that's what this movie is, an experience that's meant to be seen not read. Needless to say the performances and the direction by Matt Reaves are all phenomenal here. This is probably one of the best trilogies ever and ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the best movies of the year.","

I don't think any more sequel will be made of it. Movie is long, of 2 hours so you have to be patience and keep watching to know the end.","

"SnoopyStyle","2 May 2018","Caesar (Andy Serkis) leads his ape society in the forest. They are under constant attack by soldiers commanded by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) with Koba's surviving ape supporters serving as donkeys. The Simian flu is infecting humans turning them mute and mentally devolved. Caesar leads a team to follow The Colonel. They are joined by a mute girl and a zoo monkey called Bad Ape.There is amazing CGI work here with the ape characters. They are near perfect. This is a pretty dark episode in the Apes franchise. I like the darkness but there are some issues with the story. I don't buy any reason for Caesar to leave behind his tribe. It could only be revenge and I don't like it. I don't buy all the ape prisoners either. It seems more likely that most if not all of them would be murdered by the soldiers. I don't see them taking prisoners. When the enemy soldiers arrived in front of the compound, there was one moment of greatness that almost came to being. I wish that the enemy army is made up of apes. That would be an amazing reveal like the original's Statue of Liberty. It gets buried and the opportunity is lost. Bad Ape is an unexpected and great turn. Despite some great work, I have some issues.","

Actually, something apey is going on. I suspect we are all victims of a gorilla marketing campaign.Ha ha. Get it? A guerilla marketing...meh, never mind. The important thing is yes, this movie really is that bad. By now we are all used to the fake reviews on IMDb that accompany any movie on its opening weekend. But what is up with these inflated metacritic scores?I LOVED the first installment in this franchise. I loved the screenplay, the acting, and the gritty realism. But this? Total childish schlock. If I had to choose one and only one adjective, it would be maudlin.I would have walked out of this movie if I didn't bring four kids with me.

The ending is reminiscent of Moses crossing the Red Sea.Idle thought while waiting for something to happen in the movie - the apes are nowhere near anatomically correct.

"brainsmasher-66","16 July 2017","....continues. There are some really good scenes in this movie. If you have seen the trailers then you have seen all of the good parts. I didn't think they could make a sillier movie than the last one; but they did. Who was the target audience--preschoolers? Just sayin.The opening battle scene is fantastic. There was no way they could top that. They didn't even try. If you're gonna make a movie with talking apes make them all talk like the Planet of the Apes movies in the 60s and 70s. Only one ape can talk; but he reads sign language. The other apes cannot talk; but they all use sign language. A couple of apes can only talk baby talk or maybe they are trying to mimic the retarded. Excuse me, I should use more politically correct terms like mentally challenged or differently abled or people with cognitive disabilities. Nope, I can't do it. They talked like retards.The ape that some people claim is supposed to be a caricature of DeRay McKesson is the silliest character in the movie. He is supposed to be the comic relief ala Jar Jar Binks. Every time he was on screen I couldn't help thinking retard alert from South Park.I do not buy that Hollywood is using this movie to send coded references of the apes as black people. If they had put a monkey in a suit and made him talk like a black preacher and people had complained that they were trying to mimic Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton then I might buy that for a dollar.I thought that Woody Harrelson could save this movie because I like everything Woody Harrelson does. Woody Harrelson doesn't make bad movie choices. Maybe they paid him a boatload of money. Yeah, that's got to be it.The inclusion of the little white girl as a pet for the apes story arc is flawed and misguided, or as I like to think--just plain stupid. The apes kill her ""father"" or whoever the guy is that is caring for her and then she goes gallivanting off with the the apes like it is no big deal. The only way this makes sense is if the older man wasn't her father; but her kidnapper and abuser. Creepy.Even more creepy is when the big black Gorilla gets a crush on the little girl and puts a flower in her hair. I'm sorry; but that is what it looked like to me. One could extrapolate; but you don't really want to go there. When the big black ape gets killed the little girl is really, really, really sad and she puts a flower in his hair. She is more upset when the big black ape dies than she is when her father/kidnapper is killed. Creepy.When the apes first find the little girl she is sick; but apparently not sick enough to go on a cross country trek on horseback with strange apes. She is supposed to be sick with the virus (spoiler alert) which is why she cannot talk. But when you get sick with the virus it causes blood to pour out of your nose and mouth like Ebola and then you lose the ability to speak and then you die. The apes use a doll from the little girl to transmit the virus to the Woody Harrelson character.I could tell you more; but this review is already longer than any other review I have done. Let me recap this for you--silly, silly, silly.PS. The final battle scene is the silliest thing you have ever seen. All of Woody Harrelson's regiment are in one place. They could have been wiped out by one Apache helicopter standing off at a distance; but then there wouldn't be much fodder for a movie. Instead the helicopters make passes like an airplane and get shot down by RPGs. (Spoiler alert) After the other army smokes Woody's men and are celebrating they get wiped out by an avalanche. Oops, I just ruined the whole movie for you. Believe me, I did you a favor.","

"madonaalaeddine","28 July 2017","I am astonished, truly, that a hollow movie like spider-man; homecoming that is instantly forgettable and fixated on lame themes of stupid first-world teenage angst scored better user reviews than this masterpiece. it really says a lot about the mindlessness of modern cinema audiences, especially when the main argument is that ' there isn't enough war'. that said, user reviews are moronic. Planet of the apes is a triumph, really touching and thought, provoking on so many levels. i saw it days ago and the emotion of the film is still very fresh in my mind. in fact the more it occurs to me, the richer the movie becomes. if this is not nominated in the best film Oscars category, then the Academy is as daft as so many IMDb users.","

"LaLaLandSucks","15 July 2017","This movie was beyond boring. It was also very pretentious. There were so many plot holes in this film. Way more plot holes than Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The cinematography was very mediocre. It's the same bland, darkly lit look from the previous Dawn of the Planet of the Apes film. Camera placement wasn't very good and it had no use of the quadrant system when it came to framing either. The CGI is probably the best it's ever been, but it's nothing special. It's just a bunch of talking apes riding horses and shooting machine guns with one arm. The direction had no style, it had weak action sequences that were very stupid with very little inventive camera work. The OST composed by Michael Giacchino might be one of the most laziest OST I have ever heard. It tries to be deep and biblical, but it just ends up being laughable. This is one of the worst films of the year and probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Highly overrated.0/10.","

"dave-mcclain","14 July 2017","""War! What is it good for?"" soul singer Edwin Starr famously asked in 1970. Since the song came out at the height of the Vietnam War, it's doubtful that humans fighting apes for control of the planet is what Starr had in mind. Or maybe it was. Two years earlier, legendary actor Charlton Heston starred in the film that launched a franchise. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" told the story of a group of astronauts who landed on a planet inhabited by apes that could talk and humans that couldn't, only to discover (50-year-old spoiler alert) that the planet was earth in the distant future. In that case, the humans had clearly lost and earth had become a planet of apes. Then, a series of early 1970s prequels and sequels told the story of how that happened and what were the long-term repercussions of all of it. Next up (deliberately skipping over the silly 2001 remake), 2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" introduced Movie Fans to a pet chimp named Caesar who learned to talk and later led a rebellion against his human oppressors. In 2014, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" more clearly drew the battle lines between apes and humans, while 2017's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (PG-13, 2:20) takes that conflict to a whole new level and shows us a war that's at least good for determining who will dominate the entire planet.As this film opens, the intelligent talking chimpanzee known as Caesar (performed for the third time by Andy Serkis, again via motion capture technology) is fully in charge of the colony of apes living in the woods of northern California and dealing with the fall-out from the events of the previous film. The humans' numbers continue to diminish due to the Simian Flu, which is caused by ALZ-113, the same drug which caused the apes to develop human-like intelligence and gave some the ability to speak. As if that weren't bad enough, the virus has mutated, causing people who catch it to lose the power of speech and regress to a more primitive intellect. The humans are also still angry at the apes because of the apes' attack on San Francisco in the last film. In an attempt to preserve what's left of the human race, a rogue military leader known as The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is killing any people whom he suspects of being infected by the virus – while also trying to wipe out the ape population. After repelling one attack by the Colonel's forces, Caesar sends the survivors back to their camp with the message that leaving the apes alone in the woods could stop the fighting between ape and man. But the apes are also making plans to migrate across a vast wasteland to a distant location where they can live in peace.After an even more devastating attack by the Colonel and his men, the apes set out in search of that new home, but Caesar won't go with them. He's grown angry, bitter and vengeful and has decided to go after the Colonel personally, but Caesar's trusted lieutenants, Rocket (Terry Notary), Maurice (Karin Konoval) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) insist on coming to help. Along the way, they join forces with another talking chimpanzee called Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) and pick up a young, orphaned mute girl whom they start calling Nova (Amiah Miller). When the group finds the Colonel's camp, they are horrified to discover that his soldiers have captured and enslaved the ape community that had left the woods and are now forcing them to build a wall around the camp. This begs the question as to what or whom the Colonel is worried about keeping out, but also sets up a battle of wits between him and Caesar and a struggle for survival between apes and humans which seems destined to culminate in an epic battle.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a fantastic movie which represents the culmination of one terrific trilogy. This ""Planet of the Apes"" series established an interesting and layered mythology that continues to build on itself and get better and better as it develops. The third movie is influenced by many earlier films from various genres and decades, but is perhaps best understood as a combination of the classics ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and (especially) ""The Ten Commandments"". The intricate plotting by returning scribes Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves makes for an engrossing film that is filled with rich symbolism and important lessons for all of us real-life talking primates. Reeves is also back in the director's chair and again gives us a well-paced story full of action, excitement, suspense and heart. Last, but not least, the visual effects and acting are every bit as outstanding as in the previous two films (if not better) – especially when it comes to the motion capture performances, particularly that of Serkis. (And would the movie awards community please FINALLY recognize motion capture performances simply as PERFORMANCES, as worthy of accolades for excellence as any other, whether accomplished through prosthetics, from within intricate costumes and hair-styling or just with the simple but skillful use of the voice, face and body!) Now, returning to the question asked at the beginning of this review, what is war good for? In this case, one exceptional film. ""A""","

"Prismark10","3 June 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes starts of a with an exhilarating battle scene in the forest between apes and humans. The humans are no match to the now battle hardened apes led by Caesar who shows the human survivors mercy and offers them a truce.However the soldiers led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and aided by a few of Koba's surviving ape supporters, attack Caesar's fortress killing his wife and son. Caesar swears revenge but finds himself imprisoned with the rest of the apes who are treated as slaves having to build a wall. The humans are still affected by Simian flu which makes some of them mute. A mute girl, a zoo monkey and a few of Caesar's allies must mount a rescue attempt of the imprisoned apes so Caesar can take them to a desert paradise.The story may have inspiration from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness with the Colonel character. However after a promising beginning this becomes a dull, stupid film. The story is clunky, illogical and ponderous. As the final part of a trilogy that promised so much, I thought they might deliver a conceptually interesting ending but that was too much to hope for.","

"paul_haakonsen","24 June 2018","Having watched all of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, both the old classics and the newer additions to the franchise, then of course I also had to watch ""War of the Planet of the Apes"", despite its ridiculous title.""War of the Planet of the Apes"" is a very nice continuation of the storyline. Actually, it serves well enough to even be a stand-alone movie, although a lot of information is missing out if you haven't seen the other movies.The movie starts out in a fairly good pace, and it never really slows down, so once you strap yourself into your seat, just hang on and enjoy the ride.The movie has great CGI and special effects, of course. It is primed with lots of action and nicely executed action sequences. But it is not just the action that carries the movie, it is also the character progression and the storyline, which both actually play very big parts in this movie.""War of the Planet of the Apes"" had good acting performances from a pretty interesting cast, with the likes of Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn and many others.If you enjoyed the franchise thus far, then it would be a shame to miss out on the 2017 ""War of the Planet of the Apes"".","

I totally agree with that.This movie is much better than the previous 2. In fact, this movie should be used as ""foot"" to develop true sequels of the same quality as this, and even better.Rarely nowadays you can see a movie that is entertaining from the beginning to the end and with all the condiments you could imagine of a great movie. This movie reaches all those levels. And if you do not like it, I honestly could not understand why.It is moving, has action, has good CGI, good rhythm ... and all that works cohesively to fit in to a very good argument.What more can I say.Only those who can truly appreciate this film, forgetting their prequels, only appreciating this ... will understand.10/10","

"Chiller7","30 November 2017","Here's a movie that I'll give a high rating because it's technically well made, but I can't actually say it's my kind of movie. I like having a good time watching movies. I liked the previous two movies in this franchise. This one though, War for the Planet of the Apes, was more of a depressing experience. It's a dreary story full of cruel people (& apes) doing horrible things to each other and treating each other badly. It's the ape version of a concentration camp/holocaust movie, for those of you into that kind of thing. It's not for me, but that's just my taste, so I won't fault the movie for that.Where I can fairly subtract a couple of points from my rating would be some of the dumb decisions and illogical behavior made by some of the people made throughout the movie. Both humans and apes keep making bad decisions that get their own sides in trouble. For instance, we see here, once again, the dumb prison guard trope. Somehow, the one guy tasked with guarding a jail in movies always has to conveniently be the dumbest guy on Earth. It's frustrating to watch characters being that stupid and comes off as lazy writing.Don't get me wrong; the movie's not all bad. Excellent CGI, for instance. The quality of digital trickery has reached such levels that it's hard to even accept that those aren't real apes on screen. It's pretty impressive.","

"neil-476","9 May 2018","The third film in this series of motion-capture CGI reboot movies has a simple plot. Two groups are struggling to survive, but one believes the other must be destroyed. At the heart of the conflict are the two leaders. Intelligent chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) is familiar to us from Dawn and Rise, the two earlier films. The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is the new antagonist, in charge of many soldiers and much weaponry, and determined to wipe out the apes.Woody Harrelson is best known as a comedic actor, but there is nothing funny about The Colonel. The character is well-written, with a strong and sympathetic motivation for his actions. The scene where he explains this is truly chilling. It shows you his human pain and the inhuman result of it. Harrelson is as good in this as he has ever been.The Colonel and Caesar are well matched as antagonist and protagonist. Both characters have some justification, which gives their conflict meaning. Andy Serkis doesn't just wear the mo-cap suit as Caesar, he gives a performance of subtlety and power. This is another screen character, like Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings, worthy of Oscar nomination. It's a shame that the Academy still doesn't have a category for Best Mo-capped Performance.There is a big chunk of prison break material at the two-thirds mark. It is very entertaining and action packed, but you've probably seen it before. The Great Escape and Toy Story 3 come to mind. This film is probably the most action-oriented of the three movies, and it is all well staged. You never think ""Those apes are amazing creations"" while you are watching, you just accept them as screen reality. Only afterwards do you realise that the apes riding horses, integrating with people, snow, fire and water, and giving solid dramatic performances, don't actually exist at all outside a computer. The interaction between reality and digital creation is photo-realistically perfect.I thought the filmmakers had been a little too cute with name-checking the Apes history. We have references to Cornelius, Zira and Blue Eyes from the 1960s Apes films. Then we have orangutan Maurice, named for Maurice Evans who played orangutan Dr Zaius in those films. Worse, we have a little girl given the name Nova after a character who originally appeared in Pierre Boulle's source novel Monkey Planet in 1963. Nova has little plot relevance. A better character is Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) a well-written character who is funny and sad, and moves the story along.This film definitely provides closure for this trilogy, but there is scope for the Apes' tale to continue, and Andy Serkis has said as much. So it may be that the Law of Hollywood will apply - if it make enough money, a sequel may happen. But, if it doesn't, this film is a good way to close things.","

"jboothmillard","22 July 2017","The Planet of the Apes movies have been going since 1968, and the recent reboot series has been very successful, Rise of... being very good, and Dawn of... being fantastic, so I was hoping the third would also be great, directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In, Rise of the Planet of the Apes). Basically it has been 15 years since the ALZ-113 virus, or the Simian Flu, spread across the globe killing billions of people, following the previous events, the highly intelligent apes, led by chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) have remained in the woods. The apes are attacked by a military faction known as Alpha-Omega, a group of soldiers, who have also recruited service apes who followed Koba (Toby Kebbell), the bonobo who previously failed a coup against Caesar, some AO militants are captured and reveal that they follow the leadership of a ruthless Colonel (Woody Harrelson). The prisoners are released as a peace offering to the humans, but Caesar plans to relocate the clan across the desert, not wanting to suffer any more ape casualties, but during the night Alpha-Omega infiltrates the apes' base, and the Colonel kills Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer), and their eldest son Blue Eyes (Max Lloyd-Jones). Leaving his younger son Cornelius (Devyn Dalton) and the other apes to head for the desert, Caesar departs to exact revenge on the Colonel, accompanied by Maurice the orangutan (Karin Konoval), Luca the gorilla (Michael Adamthwaite) and Rocket the chimpanzee (Terry Notary). Caesar's party are confronted by traitorous albino gorilla Winter (Aleks Paunovic) in an Alpha- Omega camp, they learn the Colonel has departed for a location called the ""border"", Caesar inadvertently kills Winter, causing him to have visions of Koba, he worries he is becoming like him. During their journey, they find an abandoned village, there is a man who they kill when he reaches for his rifle, then they discover his daughter (Amiah Miller), who is unable to speak, Maurice insists they take her with them. Further along, they discover some Alpha-Omega soldiers who have been shot and abandoned, there is a survivor, and examining him they find he is like the mute girl, unable to speak. Later the group meet chimpanzee hermit Bad Ape (Steve Zahn), who before the Simian Flu pandemic lived in the Sierra Zoo, he directs them to the border, a former weapons depot turned into a quarantine facility after the virus began to spread. Arriving at the facility, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from an Alpha-Omega patrol, Caesar is motivated to proceed alone, he witnesses the rest of his ape clan being forced into slavery, building a wall, with no food or water, then Caesar is captured by militant gorilla Red (Ty Olsson). Caesar comes face to face with the Colonel, he reveals that the Simian Flu virus has mutated, it now causes humans who survived the original strain to become mute and regress back to a primitive state, the Colonel is barricading himself in the facility, he believes the solution is to kill any infected humans, including his own son, to stop the spread of the virus. While Caesar is tortured with starvation, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion, so the mute girl, whom Maurice names Nova, can sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food and water. Together, Caesar and Rocket plan an escape, using underground tunnels leading out of the facility, Maurice and Bad Ape use the tunnel to rescue the apes, Caesar orders them to make get away, while he goes to confront the Colonel. The facility comes under attack by rival military who want to defeat AO, Caesar reaches the Colonel, but realises he has been infected by the mutated virus, he spares his life, but the Colonel kills himself, rather than exist as a primitive. During the battle between Alpha-Omega and the rival militants, the escaping apes come under fire from AO, Caesar attempts to attack them from behind, but he is shot by human militant Preacher (Gabriel Chavarria), whom he previously set free. Red saves Caesar at the cost of his own life, and Caesar blows up the facility's fuel supplies, causing an explosion and avalanche, the Alpha-Omega are wiped and the rival militants are triumphant, but the human forces are buried by the avalanche, the apes and Nova survive by climbing nearby trees. In the end, the remaining apes depart the facility and cross the desert to find a paradise- like oasis, the apes joyously celebrate finding their new home, but Maurice discovers Caesar is fatally wounded, Caesar assures him the apes will progress with or without him, and that he will be remembered, he quietly dies. Serkis remains poignant and assertive under the motion- captured, while Harrelson as the power-crazed villain is almost too similar to Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, he cannot compete with Marlon Brando, obviously the special effects have become more advanced, making the CGI creatures and action much more realistic and incredible, and it is nice to see little bits from the original films returning, e.g. a silent girl named Nova, the big problem with this sequel is that story is not as thought-provoking as before, it is slow the majority of the time, only the fight sequences are memorable, it is unclear if the series will continue, a disappointing but reasonable science-fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Okay!","

"scottrob36","13 July 2017","I went into this film with high expectations after seeing positive reviews but I was highly disappointed. The movie was filled with plot holes and a poor concept. The previous two were brilliant with story lines where you were drawn into the dilemmas between ape and man but the third one there was none of that. There were a few characters that didn't fit and I was perplexed why the young girl was added, I can only imagine to give the apes and one human some positive interaction. The main villain didn't get a lot of screen time and I do wonder if Woody Harrelson was miscast for the role. If like me when you finish watching the movie you will be asking the same questions like ""why did they do that...what was the reason for that...how did they manage that?"" then it is obvious the movie didn't give the audience a better thought out script without gaping plot holes.","

How each breath taken has meaning and each step carefully taken.When the apes hit the screen, you are immediately struck, How far Technology has gone just a few years since RISE..This movie is epic and dramatic, A story told of the journey of Ceasar leading his people through war and his own personal conflicts, How each choice taken has consequences.The movie steers away from a full blown physical war as the title might suggest and is a lot more personal and controlled story. Through emotions and decisions the real battles worth watching are. The real war is really within ceasar the whole time.Saying more would take out the experience, trust when i say that i highly recommend the movie and if you are sick of lackluster movies, And you are ready to really kick it back and enjoy..

Growing up watching the 2nd remake (2001, and all of them are bull dung), and later on watch the original (the original are masterpieces), now I find this trilogy amazing. People complain there is no ""war"". Oh cmon, this is not like call of duty war, or Destiny war, this is evolution war, this is mental war. It is serious on so many level that the movie doesn't talk about war is just people shoot people, people shoot apes or apes shoot ape, this is the movie about mental pain (ceaser's family is killed), PTSD (ceaser keeps seeing the ghost of Koba), and metal fight (ceaser keeps fighting back his own will of revenge). This movie is touchy on so many level and the more I watch it, the more I feel fascinating about how the director can put so many content in just like 2h of watching. Truly masterpiece, in my opinion, this movie deserve 7/10 for some rush action and plot hole, but I have vowed to give any ape movie 9/10 so here you go. Stop hating and start loving the monkey.","

"adamjohns-42575","23 May 2021","A perfectly satisfactory way to end an enjoyable trilogy. It would have been easy to go all guns blazing and have a massive war between Humans and Apes worldwide with huge explosions and ridiculous death tolls on either side, but they cleverly kept it all very focused in San Francisco where the story originated and we are still unclear how the rest of the world faired against the ""Simian Flu"".The characters are all well formed having largely been in the series from the beginning and I loved to see Maurice's role grow. I also adored the addition of Bad Ape, a great performance by Steve Zahn and not what I was expecting from him at all.The CGI in this one has already vastly improved since the first of the trilogy and the apes are almost completely realistic.I'm sure there are people out there who have never seen or even heard of the original 'Planet Of The Apes' films or even the Mark Wahlberg version, so many will be surprised by the ending, but I think the majority of us all knew how it would go down for the most part. I would still like to know how Lady Liberty ends up covered in sand on a beach, but it's not something I will lose sleep over.Although I can't stand Charlton, I am tempted to try and watch the original films all the way through and I would certainly like to read the book, because these three films have sparked my interest in the larger ape world.","

What a mindless crowd of 'bots parroting paid commercial hype about something that has NO STORY, NO WAR and NO PURPOSE other than making money off of total morons. The way people mindlessly react to marketing cues like trained poodles is disturbing in the extreme. Could be useful as a first date movie or a new friend that you're not really sure about. Anyone that thinks this is a great movie is not worth associating with beyond what it takes for you to drive them home after the movie.It's almost like English panto. The play isn't funny, everyone knows what will happen, and the audience reacts on cue with as stereotypical dialogue as the actors. Seriously, targeted at gen Y? Have millennials actually been raised to react like little 'bots to particular commercial stimuli? I fear so, for there is no other reason that someone would rave about this kind of big budget, Hollyweird CRAP!And they need to be sued. The screen writing is so lazy as to be non- existent, and when they do come up with a character...it's a complete rip-off of Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. I can just hear the banter among the makers of this one. ""Uh...he's a total rip-off of Kurtz."" ""Yeah, but just stick a goatee on him and it'll be OK"".And did I mention that it was boring to the point of torture? Slow? It's stops more often than a school bus, whilst running twice as slow. Even if you're totally marketing addled and wouldn't mind this, you will mind what you pay to see it. It's simply not worth it at any price. Free. If it were free and you're mindless...maybe.

"classicsoncall","10 February 2018","I'm still astounded by the incredible makeup that goes into creating the ape characters in these 'Planet of the Apes' movies. The facial features are so expressive that you would think they're the real deal. I think that's primarily what draws me to these pictures, as the stories become somewhat formulaic over time. What caught my attention in this one had almost nothing to do with the story per se, but the little things inserted by the film makers that brought back a hint of nostalgia for this viewer. Like the 'Bedtime for Bonzo' helmet on one of the human soldiers in the early part of the movie, and the Chevy II Nova chrome plate that showed up as one of the artifacts in the film. My first car was a 1969 Chevy Nova, so that's where the reference resonates with me. 'Ape-Pocalypse Now' was a bit of a stretch, but what the heck, that was kind of cool too.Interestingly, this was the second movie in a row I've seen in which Woody Harrelson kills himself. Out of sequence as I write this, but I saw ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" just the other day, and this one has Harrelson's character doing himself in too. It didn't seem like it had to go that way, so I guess The Colonel's condition was beyond hope, even though it didn't look that bad to me. The thing that bothered me in the picture was the lack of a back story to the young girl, given the name Nova (Amiah Miller) by the Orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval). One assumes she was the daughter of the soldier that was killed by the ape band, but it occurred to me that didn't necessarily have to be so. It would have been welcomed to have her character expanded a bit on.The way the story ended was kind of novel. The avalanche wiping out both The Colonel's men and the attacking soldiers from the North had the effect of wiping the slate clean so the apes could move on. Unfortunately though, just like the Bible character Moses, our hero Caesar never makes it with his troop to the Promised Land.","

"gelmcchristop","21 December 2020","I am surprised in a positive way by how well an action trilogy has evolved, and the final part did not disappoint me. Acceptable and in some sequences admirable directing-editing choices, accompanied by above solid cinematography, with amazing sets and balanced colors. The visual effects were (naturally for the trilogy) stunning, yet even here they outdid themselves, with probably some of the best explosions we've seen on screen. Honorable mention is the script of the movie. Despite the fact that the military stuff was obviously overlooked to let the rest of the movie flow, they succeeded in that goal, without getting the viewer disengaged. And for the best part, as dystopian movies go, War for the Planet of the Apes is clearly and overlooked one: won't go over spoilers here, i'll just say it presents some successfully blurred lines between right and wrong, making you wonder what the ""good ending"" should be.
Last thing I would like to point out, I do not see why people are getting all political about this-it's near a masterpiece, so please do not let any opinions of that nature ruin the experience for you.","

"jippy33","12 October 2017","First of all, this movie is a victim of audience expectations and bad marketing. You would think this was the ape vs human version of Saving Private Ryan when looking at the trailers. It is not. It is a 140-minute drama about family, grief, survival and war. It is a bold move for a franchise that has been all CGI and action.Sure, there is hardly a scene without CGI (since there is hardly a scene without an ape) and the movie is bookended by great action set pieces. But the roughly hour-and-a-half in the middle is a journey, both literally and metaphorically. The emotional depth that is displayed by the primary characters with very little dialogue is astounding and very rare in this genre. I was shattered after this movie was done, so invested in the characters, so overjoyed by their victories and grief-stricken by their hardships. And the amazing cinematography only strengthens the depth of every scene. Throw in quite a bit of humor as well and you have a drama for the ages.Special mention has to be given Amiah Miller. She has not a single line of dialogue, yet struck every chord of the emotional spectrum as the sole human amongst all the apes. The journey of a child, left alone only to find a new home in the most unlikely place of all is an amazing tearjerker when acted and shot this well.There are some tropes here and there that made me roll my eyes a bit. You have the odd ex-machina and what not. It still does not stop me from dishing out my first IMDb 10 in 2017.","

"joshbarton15","12 July 2017","Maintaining such a high standard of quality throughout a franchise is one of the toughest challenges in filmmaking however, it's a challenge that War for the Planet of the Apes thrives on, going on to become the best of the Planet of the Apes reboot series. Growing in stature and intelligence, mirroring the journey of Caesar throughout the series, each film has delivered and in War for the Planet of the Apes, it has a stunning final chapter.Two years have passed since events in San Francisco shattered any chance of peace between humans and apes. The two species have been at war with each side suffering major losses. Wrestling with his darker instincts, Caesar (Andy Serkis) ventures out to confront the Colonel (Woody Harrelson), a man hellbent on wiping out Caesar and the rest of the apes.Opening with an incredibly tense sequence that sees a group of soldiers closing in on an ape trench where Caesar is hiding, War for the Planet of the Apes builds on the foundations laid by its two predecessors to deliver a film that never loses focus of its narrative, all while continuing to deliver spectacle in abundance. The strong narrative is a key feature of the series and War of the Planet of the Apes exceeded my expectations with the story it tells. The strained relationship between humans and apes is just the tip of the iceberg and, if you thought things got bad between the two in the previous films, you haven't seen anything yet.Caesar remains a focal point for this film and rightly so. We see the strength of Caesar as a leader of both the apes and a family but we also get to see the weakness he has of controlling his conflicting emotions towards humans, visions of Koba haunting him as he must decide what's best for the apes. The majority of the film is spent with the apes and it's a true testament to both the visual effects and the motion capture performances that the film is able to do this.Matt Reeves returns to direct this instalment and this is easily his most accomplished piece of work yet, beating the stellar work he did on Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Whether it's building tension, evoking emotion or delivering pulsating action, Reeves delivers plenty of memorable moments to go with some of the great moments in the series. Reeves' film is accompanied by the outstanding visual effects that have grown better and better with each film, some breathtaking cinematography from Michael Seresin and Michael Giacchino's score that brilliantly accentuates the interchange of emotions throughout.Coming to the performances, War for the Planet of the Apes continues the groundbreaking work done with motion capture performance throughout the series. Andy Serkis is once again superb in the role of Caesar, giving arguably his best performance to date, conveying such a range of emotion phenomenally well. The time has come for Serkis to get the recognition he deserves with some awards nominations because what he does with the character of Caesar is nothing short of spectacular. Serkis is joined by the returning Karin Konoval as Maurice and Terry Notary as Rocket, who both continue the solid work they've done before in the series. It's new character Bad Ape, played by Steve Zahn, that will no doubt steal the show for many people, his eccentricity and likability making him such a stand out from the rest of the ape characters. He comes with a lot of humour and I think they pitched it perfectly, Bad Ape not becoming annoying or unfunny at any point. I was looking forward to Woody Harrelson's presence in the film and, while I thought he was very good as the Colonel, I was genuinely surprised at the direction his character went, and I'm sure I won't be the only one.Closing out a trilogy is never easy but the final moments of War for the Planet of the Apes is one of those times where there is nothing but silence from the audience out of sheer captivation and respect. It's a stunningly triumphant final chapter in what has to go down as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history.","

"Stevieboy666","23 July 2020","I have enjoyed watching these 21st Century Apes films, they are certainly well made and have superb special effects, sadly that cannot be said for some many movies. I really liked the character of Bad Ape, he injected some humour into what is a very bleak story. The only downside for me is that it is pretty long, a bit slow at times. Not my favourite entry but good none the less.","

"davidmvining","8 September 2020","The renewed Apes franchise comes to a conclusive end (while keeping things open for further sequels that are currently in development) with a trilogy capper that intelligently explores the fallout from the previous film for the main character. Matt Reeves follows up one of the best big budget special effects driven films of the last decade with a very good film that understands where the central character needs to go next.It's been several years since the events of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Caesar has been running a guerilla war against the remnants of the US military at his heels. The movie begins with a pitched battle as the military finds the ape refuge and attacks only to get defeated soundly. Caesar has hardened since the war started, but he's still grasping onto his morality, manifested by him letting the few survivors go back to their colonel with a message that the war could end if the humans would simply leave them alone. That, of course, does not come to pass. Instead, the colonel brings in a special ops force to sneak in at night and assassinate Caesar in his sleep, killing Caesar's wife and eldest son instead. This does to Caesar what Koba had wanted from him before his death. Koba saw nothing good in humanity, and now, having felt the terrors of war firsthand and personally, Caesar falls into what Koba had wanted before his death.The new film intelligently keeps Koba around, not as a primary antagonist, but as a ghost who haunts Caesar. The defeat of Koba himself doesn't defeat Koba's ideology. That's something that Caesar must continue to fight long after Koba himself has died. At the death of two members of his family, Caesar falls instantly into that, abandoning the ideological fight that he had won, and seeing nothing but the innate evil of humanity. He sets out on his own (with a few others who refuse to be left behind) to kill the colonel himself while the rest of the herd moves off to find somewhere else to live, their location having been revealed to the humans.Along the way, they pick up a mute girl, and while the girl herself ends up working really well, I feel like her early introduction, right after Caesar has determined that he has become a Koba-like nihilist, is a bit too obvious. Suddenly, Caesar has a little human girl who could never be a real threat to him in his presence right after he picked up his anti-human feelings. Well, yeah, she's going to be one of the primary vessels to get him out of it, why do you ask? They also end up meeting a new ape, one who has no connection to the group but still can speak and has the increased intelligence of the rest, Bad Ape, a former denizen of a zoo who's been barely surviving just outside of humanity's reach and knows of the likely place where the colonel went to.What's interesting about the human characters in this, the third of the rebooted Apes franchise, is that the humans are possibly even more interesting than the apes for the first time. The Colonel is a version of Colonel Kurtz in the movie's most obvious reference to Apocalypse Now. He's a madman who's seen things that his superiors haven't. They don't understand, and, what makes him most interesting, is that he's actually right to a great degree. His effort to destroy the apes isn't driven by hatred, but by a change in the nature of the conflict that Caesar doesn't even realize has happened. The virus that wiped out most of humanity and made the apes smart has mutated and started making humans no more than beasts. It's not a clash of civilizations, it's a fight for humanity's survival, and no one has realized it yet other than him. To add to the character, Woody Harrelson is absolutely electric as The Colonel. He's quiet, intelligent, zealous in his belief, and cruel all at once. His scenes with Caesar are the absolute height of the film as Caesar steadily gets to know the man he wants to kill.Caesar's hatred, though, gets balanced with the fact that The Colonel found the herd and captured them, forcing them to build a wall at the abandoned weapons depot. He can't simply act on his own emotions despite moving in ways designed to separate himself from responsibility. Instead he finds himself grounded by his own people, no matter what he tries. He can't completely descend into Koba's viewpoint. He still has a small son to worry about.It comes down to the conflict between The Colonel, who's taking a by any means necessary approach to a fight he knows he losing, and Caesar, who was willing to take a similar approach in a fight he had thought he had already lost, that is the center of the film. Perhaps the best scene is when the conflict comes to an end, and Caesar cannot take his vengeance anymore. It's a mixture of pity, anger, and relief that goes across Caesar's perfectly rendered digital face, and it shows him a different way forward, one that helps him purge himself of Koba's ghost completely.War for the Planet of the Apes is steeped in the history of the franchise, using elements such as Nova, Charlton Heston's voice, the Alpha and Omega symbols from Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and the human muteness as building blocks in a story about Caesar's final journey into leadership and personhood. It also intelligently uses movies of the past, particularly Apocalypse Now, as inspiration for how to tell this story, going beyond parody and firmly entering homage while standing on its own two feet. I suppose my only small problem is the early use of Nova, though I do appreciate how she gets used later. Still, the movie is a very good final chapter to this new Apes trilogy.","

"TheMovieDiorama","9 March 2018","Just when I thought no blockbuster would be worthy of a perfect rating, this beauty comes along and proves me wrong. Oh. My. Word. This was absolutely phenomenal. Flawless in terms of the summer blockbuster season. A damn masterpiece in conveying conflict in both war and within one's self. A defining film that will change motion capture imagery for the future (Avatar may have just lost its crown). An action spectacle that knows how to balance explosions with thought-provoking themes and dialogue. A finale that ends a fantastic trilogy (that really we didn't deserve) and cements it as one of the best trilogies of all time. Another reason to love Andy Serkis even more due to his captivating lead performance and consistent hard work on and off screen. So much grit and realism that you'll be questioning to yourself halfway through: ""...hang on, these are CGI apes right?"" as your mind melts and becomes entranced by the sheer perfection of every piece of fur that's visible to human eye as it blows gently in the snowy winds!! So. Much. Emotion. I teared not once, not twice, but three damn times. It's relentless, the waves of emotion just kept crashing down on me...and yet I didn't want to escape. I've grown attached to these complex emotive characters for three films, every chapter felt like getting to know them. The beauty of it is, that the dialogue is minimal...is all in their eyes! So many scenes where the Apes look directly into the camera...into my soul! The human girl added a much needed symbol to the plot: innocence. The dialogue between Harrelson's ""Colonel"" and Caesar was palpable, a five minute scene just of raw powerful dialogue. Bad Ape was a much required lighthearted character who brings some smiles because this film is relentlessly depressing, I warn you now, your soul will be drained of all emotions. But my God what a journey, no regrets whatsoever. Without a doubt, War for the Planet of the Apes gets the perfect rating.","

"fernandoschiavi","22 November 2020","War for Planet of the Apes offers a satisfactory conclusion to this new phase. Mature and at the same time poetic, War for the Planet of the Apes ends with a flourish one of the best current trilogies. Showing the outcome of the war between apes and humans, the third film is much more than the final clash between the races, it is the end point of a powerful discussion started since the first film about our sense of humanity and superiority that never leaves us.In this closing of the most recent trilogy, humans and apes cross paths again. Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his group are forced into a war against an army of soldiers led by a ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson), who does his best to ensure his survival when the virus that has decimated humanity begins to present a new side effect: speech loss in humans. When Caesar suffers a personal loss in a conflict, he sets up a personal mission to locate and neutralize the Colonel, aiming to end the war between humans and apes once and for all.In War for the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves concludes the prelude to the story of the 1968 film (based on the book by Frenchman Pierre Boulle) with the same urgencies as the previous features (Rise of the planet of the apes, 2011, and Dawn of the planet of the apes, 2014). The tone, however, is different, in a biblical mix of conflict and restart. Over a little over six years, we have followed César's evolution (a remarkable work by Andy Serkis). Not only from a technological point of view, with a clear leap in the movement capture technique (of which Serkis has already become an ambassador), but above all from a narrative perspective, full of meanings.
If Matt Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback had already offered something very simplistic and straightforward in Dawn of the planet of the apes, they further reduce the scale and events in War, which is limited to a journey of personal revenge in a narrative without many elements, nuclei of history or even dialogues. Almost all of the 140 minutes of projection are dedicated to Caesar and the core of apes, never diverting the point of view to any human character, who occupy - in the majority - the position of antagonism of the feature. This guarantees the most beautiful and rare moments in the current american blockbuster cinema scene, where various actions and thoughts are resolved through sign language, looks or simple bodily interactions; although César's speech is much improved in this film. The third part of the new franchise trilogy is not as exciting in terms of action as the previous film, but it certainly reflects and discusses its main themes with more depth and maturity than its predecessors.Precisely for these moments, the first act and the beginning of the second are the best moments of the projection. With an impressive opening scene that accompanies the soldiers invading the territory of the apes, Reeves does the favor of avoiding the pyrotechnics of the endless (nothing against, but they contributed little to the evolution of the narrative in the previous features) battle scenes. The war that the title announces takes place much more in a psych sociological field than in front scenes. The small expedition led by Caesar, made up of his companions Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket (Terry Notary) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) is a strong remnant of western cinema, with the quartet riding slowly across icy landscapes on Canadian soil, and especially melancholic because we are in a post-apocalyptic environment. In this way, we obtained beautiful images that Reeves and cinematographer Michael Seresin, also guaranteeing a good rhythm and a highly immersive atmosphere - the fantastic soundtrack by Michael Giacchino also deserves credits in the creation of this universe, bringing a beautiful waltz as a final theme.
Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback draw the parallels between fictional dystopia and our world: two opposing forces are at war with each other because of their distinct worldviews. It looks familiar, doesn't it? The similarities with reality are even more accentuated with the introduction of the Colonel (Woody Harrelson), the military leader who, in order to protect his soldiers, wants to build a wall that separates them from their enemies. The script builds the character in such a way that he personifies the worst in societies around the world today: the fear and hatred of the different, the subversion of the concept of justice to an ideal of revenge, the lack of dialogue and the widespread hostility to anything that might go against an old-fashioned concept of ""morals and good manners"".The emotional plot of War for the Planet of the Apes comes with great action sequences. Matt Reeves delivers an excellent direction completely inspired by New Hollywood from the 70s: the filmmaker applies here framing, lighting and camera movement techniques used by Stanley Kubrick (using the classic centralized framing), Martin Scorsese (using the cuts to create a vibrant rhythm for the scenes), Francis Ford Coppola (taking advantage of lights and shadows to create an atmosphere and reflect the mood of the characters on screen). The influence of films like Apocalypse Now, The Bridge on the River Kwai and The Ten Commandments is explicit. In this amalgamation of genres, Reeves, who signs the script with Mark Bomback, tells an epic story without falling into Manichaeism and goes far beyond the promise of the title war. The Colonel is not a mere villain in his opposition to Caesar, just as the hero is not perfect or infallible. The meeting of the two exposes the complex nature that determines ""humanity"" in the search for survival. Relationships packed with grandeur on the Michael Giacchino score, which alternates brutality and lightness in a journey of many layers, including bringing us a beautiful waltz as a final theme.Reeves proves that he knows not only how to use all the space on the screen, but how to position his camera in a way to decentralize the viewer's gaze. Even when working with gangs, the action does not become dull or lose focus. The camera follows the characters, without losing life in the midst of shots and explosions. The rhythm is built alternating between play and conflict, drama and humor, in a composition that never loses strength in the two hours and twenty minutes of the film fly by. In the first scene, we start with a long shot that introduces us to the soldiers, culminating in a violent confrontation and that already shows us how the visual effects are supernatural: the hair, looks and the light reflect in an extremely realistic way on the apes, each increasingly expressive. Reeves also brings his suspenseful hand from Let Me in and Cloverfield for more tense sequences, like the first encounter between Caesar and the Colonel; marked by shadows and beams of light from weapons and laser sights, and the great battle that ends the projection, full of small conflicts and climaxes that grab the viewer by the throat. It is impossible not to be moved.
The biggest problem is even in the second act, where the narrative takes a curve that appeals to its unpredictability, but ends up sinning in terms of rhythm and duration. More focused on what happens in the human nucleus, it is where Reeves and Bomback end up ""trying too hard"" to reach a dramatic and melancholic level, as if the thematic and visual reference to the Holocaust and Fascism were not enough by themselves - a similar problem that also hit Logan, where the film seems to try too hard to be something more complex and adult - although the dialogues of the excellent Woody Harrelson make this effort worthwhile. Guerra works precisely in its most subtle moments, and this exposure ends up harming and disturbing the good rhythm, besides extending the duration of the film too much.In addition to Reeves and Harrelson, another name that stands out in War for the Planet of the Apesis Andy Serkis, again giving life - through the performance capture technique, which makes the experience visceral. It is possible to see the actor in Cesar's eyes and, at the same time, completely forget the elaborate process necessary for the character to come to life. What you see is in fact a chimpanzee who loves his family, needs to guide a people and overcome a conflict in the search for a civilized life. Serkis transcends layers of equipment and delivers genuine emotion, with an impressive degree of expression and mastery of the body.Planet of the Apes: The War is a worthy and satisfying conclusion to this new trilogy that will definitely be remembered as one of the best commercial American cinema has ever seen. With a greater focus on personal dramas and metamorphoses, Pierre Boulle's creation has never been better represented. War for the Planet of the Apes is a cinematic experience of technical quality and dramatic reach. It is the return of classic cinema in technological packaging, made to entertain, but without underestimating its audience. The work may slightly disappoint those who seek an apotheosis even more frantic than Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, but it will certainly delight and dazzle those who, in the midst of so many shallow blockbusters, are looking for a commercial film that knows how to discuss their own themes with sobriety, maturity and without appealing to pedantry.","

After_the_apes_suffer unimaginable_losses, Caesar_wrestles_with_his_darker_instincts_and begins_his_own_mythic_quest_to_avenge_his_kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet.Let me start of by saying that if the action was the main reason you liked Rise and Dawn, this movie is not for you. It contains some well done action but it is a drama film first and foremost. If you accept the movie for that(and have watched Rise & Dawn), I imagine you will love this movie.Let's start with the story. War is a deep, dark, harrowing story about what humanity will do to save itself. That is a deep question for a movie about talking apes. It asks the audience if they would give up their humanity, to save humanity and that is powerful stuff. It is a genuinely harrowing question that I adore this movie for addressing. The ending for this movie is beautiful and poetic. It is the perfect end to a great trilogy. I will not spoil the ending but just know it is a very emotional experience that combines the harrowing questions of what is humanity with the spectacular buildup coming off Rise and Dawn. The writers of this trilogy could literally just have dumb plots that give us an excuse for apes to fight. They COULD do that but they don't. Each movie has given us a great, thought provoking story and making it the primary focus for this movie was a dangerous risk which I am pleased to say payed off. The overarching arc for this trilogy story wise has been excellent and is very rewarding for people who see the movies one after each other. I have NO complains with the plot and script for this movie; it is excellent.One more note on the dialogue. There is a chilling monologue from Woody Harrellson near the midpoint of the movie. It serves as an exposition dump, which is annoying, but the way they handled it makes me not care in the slightest. I got goosebumps on my arms from the writing of that one scene(you'll know it when you see it) and that is something I must praise the stellar crew behind this movie for.I've said it once, I've said it twice. I'll say it one last time, Academy. Give Andy Serkis a god damn Oscar. He deserves it! His performance throughout these movies is realistic in portraying an ape, and also a brilliant achievement in making an ape show emotion. Serkis has proved his worth multiple times and it is about time we show him he is appreciated. As much as I loved Hugh Jackman in 'Logan', Serkis deserves the Oscar. And unless something else comes out this year which sways my opinion, I will stand by it.My, and pretty much everyone,'s primary criticism with Rise and Dawn was the exceptionally weak human characters. This film changed that. Woody Harrellson gives a powerhouse performance as The Colonel and made him a terrifying villain. I don't quite agree he was better than Koba(Toby Kobell) but Koba had more time to develop and I think that was the reason he has the edge. I've mentioned the brilliance in the writing that made that monologue great but it was also Harrelson's performance. He gave me the chills and that is impressive. The most scary thing about The Colonel, however, is, well two things but they go hand in hand, the fact he remains nameless, and the fact I understand his point of view. Not giving him a name makes him more scary because it means that it could be any one person. It doesn't blame someone specific and it implies that anyone could become him given the circumstances. Giving him understandable motives also relates to this because it genuinely makes me question my own morality and humanity and makes me think what I would do in the situation he was in. It is rare a movie villain can do that and I truly applaud the film for that. The Colonel's end was also fitting and expertly handled.Karin Konoval has been consistently good throughout the entire trilogy. Steve Zahn's Bad Ape had the unfortunate job of the comic relief. He had to be funny and stupid but not to the point where he was annoying and obnoxious. And Zahn pulled this off expertly. I never disliked Bad Ape and consistently found him funny. He was a welcome addition to the film.The cinematography for this movie is breathtaking. I was gobsmacked for one very specific sequence in this movie towards the end, purely because of how beautifully it was shot and edited. The entire trilogy has been consistently impressive to look at cinematography wise but this film takes the icing on the cake in that department.If this franchise is robbed of ONE MORE best visual effects Oscar, I will lose my mind. The fact that the visual effects team can transform human being into living, breathing apes need to be commended. It is visually stunning and the CGI is flawless. This is a technical marvel on the same level as The Jungle Book. Yeah, I went there.All in all, War for the Planet of the Apes is a change of pace from the previous two installments but that does not mean it holds any punches. The minuscule amount of action used was great but I'm glad they committed to a drama story. If you accept this film as a drama, not action film; you will love it a lot more. And if you haven't seen Rise or Dawn, watch them before this movie. You will get the most enjoyment possible that way. I'll rate this movie a flawless 10 BAD APES out of 10!","

"esthercross","22 July 2017","I personally struggled to stay motivated with this one. Whilst we should applaud the magician worthy skills of the CGI technicians, I found myself emotionally disconnected from the story and my eyes where craving that other 75 percent of the colour wheel by the end.Structurally I think it is always a rocky choice to put a fight scene at the very start of the film as even in the case of sequels we are not as emotionally invested in the outcome of the characters and you loose the important fight scene tension. I needed the person beside me to check my pulse for how little I felt for the opening battle. If we had seen some touching exchange between ape families with some heartfelt music I may have felt more about the outcome of the opening 15 minutes.Planet of the apes doesn't offer much in the way of relief from the dreary colours, angst and rain. The film doesn't have much of a sense of humour about it other then the token laugh an hour character 'bad ape' who was charming but not enough to save the film for me. I don't want to let it go by unmentioned though that I think Andy Serkis is Devine and endlessly watchable. I think that the sincerity within Caesars portrayal was mesmerising. It was almost a well crafted duet between Serkis and the breath taking capabilities of modern CGI.Unfortunately I'm gonna have to return to the small matter of me not enjoying the film. Another point I have to made is that I felt that the moments of tenderness where at times a little contrived. The film needed more poetry as a whole but the few attempts at a heartfelt scene for me where a little tenuous I don't wanna include spoilers but you might agree that the 'sad' scene with the 'reprised blossom behind the ear' didn't quite have the right foundation for actual poignancy.Right at the start of the film a drunk man arrived late and made his way to his front row seat across the front of the auditorium with his bottle of water held high in a victorious manner (perhaps he sneaked in) he continued to walk with vigour until he collided with the wall opposite. I know that the people I watched Planet of the Apes with also weren't particularly taken with the film because when we filed out the cinema the drunk man was the first and only thing my friends wanted to talk about.","

"akshatmahajan","16 October 2020","War for the Planet of the Apes is a great movie. There are a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Everything serves the characters and story. This movie has death, suffering, plight, heroism and empathy. The effects are astonishing..Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to, ""give me action"" needs. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films.The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action. Beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters. This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.Overall, you should watch it for yourself and shouldn't believe in negative reviews. Those who gave negative reviews to this movie are those who wanted only fight/ action scenes and those who don't have knowledge of pure cinema.","

I cried the last time I watched it and the time before. Most importantly, I cried the first time. I cried in the cinema lobby. I cried in the toilets. I cried on the way home. I cried while scoffing down chips and cried myself to sleep.
Watch this film for the love of God. It was the first time I cried in the cinema and the only time I've ever cried that much. If someone (me) can have such a connection to Caesar than this is a film worth watching for everyone.","

"jace_the_film_guy","9 July 2021","Honestly, I was expecting more from the final chapter in the trilogy. A lot of the ""soft"" moments felt forced and I was expecting something different when the title includes ""War"". There were moments that dragged for me, but the story itself made sense. Caesar's end was anticlimactic and I left wishing for some more closure. I might have to do a rewatch without the prior expectations I had for the film.","

"ibibrov","1 May 2020","War for the Planet of the Apes was the best of the trilogy, and a truly beautiful and unique experience to sit through, my eyes glued to the screen taking in the jaw dropping visual effects, enabling Andy Serkis to deliver one of the most iconic performances I've ever seen, along with everyone else. Every character was complex, nuanced, and believable, with their own motivations and feelings, making for some very thoughtful and quiet moments, highlighted by beautiful cinematography and a quiet score. I loved this movie, and it easily deserves 9/10 stars.","

"adamdaly1985","18 July 2017","I entered the theatre with a relatively open mind. I had recently seen 'Get Out' after my reluctance in being entertained by more leftist social justice propaganda had somewhat subsided. And I was incredibly surprised. I loved the film! Yes, there were heavy nods to the oppression of people of colour but it was done intelligently and from a somewhat unique angle. Plus, the film was well written, well acted and paced perfectly. So despite the trailer for 'War for the Planet of the Apes' looking like a grotesquely obvious allegory for the upcoming race-war, I figured I might be wrong. I hated the prospect of Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' and the film quickly became a favourite of 2017 for me. It turns out I was right all along. The film stinks of social justice and white privilege. The overwhelmingly white human race are portrayed as a wholly irredeemable group of oppressive savages. Meanwhile the Apes are the oppressed. The unfairly vilified. The misunderstood. The empathetic and admirable. The unsubtle links to today's cultural environment wouldn't have been any more obvious if scene's were dressed in 'Ape Lives Matter' banners or Antifa masks.As far as the film itself, it's about the least layered piece I may ever have seen. There's no subtext, no intelligent subplots. Apes are good, (white) humans are bad. I really can't expand any further on this storytelling mechanic. It is what it is, albeit with lots of CGI. I've ran out of energy to finish reviewing this disappointment. Why the IMDb rating is so high can only reflect either a declining level of acceptable standards or the production company purchasing IMDb accounts. I have seen far more poor reviews than positive and cannot accept people interested in good film would be so complimentary of this huge pile of visual faeces. 2/10","

"aharmas","21 July 2017","The conclusion to the latest version of one of the ""Planet of the Apes"" proves to be a superb production, full of both action and heart. With a solid screenplay that dedicates equal time to pensive quiet moments and action that moves the story to its emotional conclusion, we are given what is arguably the masterpiece of the year.Caesar is now in the middle of a conflict that will decide the fate of his followers. He still considers murder an abominable act and preaches for peaceful solutions. Let us live in peace and everything should be fine. Well, not everything is going the way he wants. His family is murdered by an unstable and vengeful colonel who wants to exterminate the apes and carryout his plans for revenge.Caesar's tragedy propels him to find the colonel and seek justice. There is much happening during his trip, and we are witnesses to the effects of the apes' evolution on their human counterparts. Whoever hasn't been killed by the virus is now regressing into different types of humanoids. It's affecting their speech and mental capacities. This becomes an essential plot development that explains what is going on with the colonel.Humans are for the most part portrayed as cruel assassins, with a collective desire to destroy life. The scenes in the base recall concentration camp mentality, and the final battles are portrayed in such a way that we know nothing good will come out of it. Nature is beginning to settle the conflict, and it might end up playing an important part in the film's climax.Much of the success is Andy Serkis' amazing turn as Caesar. He keeps getting better and better, giving us access to the turmoil and the variety of feelings he experiences throughout the film. Intelligence, grief, anger, surprise are clearly shown, and we soon forget that we CGI is even a part of the equation.The film has an epic film, with gorgeous vistas shown in the different parts of the journey. Emotions are highlighted by the use of light and how the camera focuses on everything, the faces, and the background. It's a beautiful way to tell a story, and as you will have experienced by the film's conclusion, and to reach an audience by touching their hearts.","

"dromasca","28 July 2017","'Planet of the Apes' generated by now enough big screen and TV series film to be considered a genre or at least a sub-genre by itself. While the original series was playing more in the post-apocalyptic stories space with the original movie one of the strong head of series creation, the more recent remake started as a sci-fi thriller. The second and now third film in the series see the two themes converge as enough bad things happened on Planet Earth for mankind to become again endangered species. Actually both apes and humans seem to be endangered in this latest War for the Planet of the Apes and the two species are caught in a deadly war that may prove to be fatal to both.The premises of the story are similar with the majority of the other films in the series. Humans have made enough fatal mistakes and their psychological, biological, but especially character problems make of them inferior (on the moral if not also on the intelligence scales) to the apes. On the ruins of what was once our civilizations gangs of human survivors and herds of ape survivors fight for their own existence and between them. It's not a modern war, it's more like tribal fights. Which is no less cruel or spectacular in cinematographic terms.When this new series started and I saw the first film (I think that I missed the second) I appreciated the technical performance of making of each one of the apes a character of its own using computer graphics enhancement, but the story seemed thin and conventional. This third film has the same problems, actually it got worse. Visuals are impressing but the story got not only conventional but full of clichés. It's a deja-vu post-apocalyptic story with religious and moralistic tones, and having it spoken 80% of the time by apes does not make it smarter. Some of the choices of director Matt Reeves also seemed to me uninspired. Some of the apes talk a sign language, other a primitive form of the language of the enemy (English, of course). Arms are an odd mix of modern weaponry, tribal bow and arrows and beginning of the 20th century guns. Female apes are wearing ear-rings. etc. It's difficult to talk too much about acting, as playing the human model for the apes computer image requires special skills - I assume they are OK as the effect is fine, but it's not a novelty any longer and the film relies too much on those. So I assume Andy Serkis is a fine actor but I need to see more of him, while Woody Harrelson does what we expect from him in the human bad guy role.The ending of the original 'Planet of the Apes' was mind-blowing, one of the most memorable final scenes in the history of cinema. What we have in 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is so far from that. The action twist and the meaningful reflection on the future of mankind that were turning the original into a great movie was replaced by a so expected and conventional image with moralistic and religious pretensions. This says almost all about the failure of this film. Faithful fans (and I am among them) will go and see this film. Many will be disappointed, as it is heavy and full of stuff that we have already seen so many times. Good cinematography and special effects are also repetitive and cannot save it. One of the characters is called Bad Ape and repeats his name many times in the movie. He may have said 'Bad Planet' as well.","

He's the crown jewel of this franchise and he leads the charge from beginning to end this time around. I also have to make room for Steve Zahn's performance as a newly introduced ape, who is about the closest thing to a comic relief this film gets and his comic timing and tender eccentricity allows some breathing room between all the doom and gloom","

"Fluke_Skywalker","11 November 2017","Plot; A new threat causes a faction of the remaining human army to become even more desperate to destroy the apes once and for all.The ""War"" in the title is a tad misleading here. It's got the trappings of a war film, and there's some conflict, but anyone expecting factions of apes and humans frothing at the mouth and charging toward one another in a last desperate battle for supremacy are going to be sorely disappointed.With a glacial pace, one dimensional characters and ham-fisted drama, War utterly wastes its impressive technical merits. Whatever it lacks dramatically and intellectually--and it lacks a lot--the apes look damn impressive.","

"gmoorehe","18 July 2017","I really liked the 1st movie and enjoyed the 2nd so figured the 3rd would be a good ending except they forgot to write a story. This film is 140 minutes long -- with at least 45 minutes too many of ape closeups, or should I say CGI closeups. The sad thing is they could have soared with the 3rd installment but instead made a $150 million dud. Soldiers with modern lethal weapons against apes with spears - just crazy. And the moral of the story, well there really wasn't one except all the human soldiers good and bad got killed while a remnant of apes survived along with a mysterious young girl who joined the apes. I think I would have preferred something where the conflict rises to a crescendo and then ends with a fragile peace with apes and humans learning to live together, not separate. Alas, the ""authors"" decided that apes and humans can't live together. Let's hope there is never another plant of the apes, ever.","

"fisherbee1-1","16 July 2017","I was excited to go watch this installment having really enjoyed the previous two movies. Seeing it, however, was quite disappointing. The visuals were fine, as expected, and the acting was as good as ever. The story, however, seemed to crawl, and the anti-American anti-military, and anti-Christian references removed any remaining enjoyment. Instead of seeing things from both perspectives, as we did in the previous two movies, it's all from the viewpoint of the apes, and humans are seen as evil, and mostly shallow. No deep human characters in the entire film, no perspective of the humans; just flat villains about which the apes have to worry. There are some references to the old film series, which fans will notice, and an amusing few places, but the political theming and dragging storyline make this one far under par.","

The action was disappointing but the graphics/ape visuals were on par with other movies.No clue why Hollywood must always make one sided conflicts where losers look incompetent just to make winners look brilliant. Personally it shows a lack of creative genius in their writing/directing. OR it could just be their way of ensuring movie is completed on schedule with weak plots? Do yourself a favor and wait for video or do like I did and see it at a matinée (which was still too much $$).","

"sswilkinson","16 July 2017","I've seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell, I've seen the remake with Tim Roth, I've seen thousands of films during my life. War for the Planet of the Apes seemed to me as simply a showcase for the digital ape effects.It's full of closeups of different digital ape faces against a blurry background. Af if it's 1957 and we should be marveling at new Disneyland animatronic characters. It's full of distant shots of digital chimps scurrying around. That's most of the movie.What people are saying is thought provoking, is a simple illustration of two groups in conflict. Draw comparisons to Nazis and Jews, black and white, Shia and Shi'ite, slave and slave owner. The same ""thought provoking"" questions arise.The only difference here is that it's put into a science fiction context - what if apes were as smart as humans? Well, what if cats were? Or squirrels? Had this been an action film, I'd say OK, it's an action movie and it's fine. But it isn't. It has some action, but is not an action film. It's mostly a very slow moving, dull, inarticulate drama.Inarticulate in two ways. A lot of the apes use sign language instead of speech, and the script is not clever or intellectual. A few flashes of well written dialog come up during an exchange between the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and Caesar (digital ape) and that's all there is. Less than five minutes. The rest of the dialog is mainly focused on vengeance and war or merciful understanding. There's no complexity or intellectual stimulation here.I'm shocked that nearly all professional film critics give this movie a high rating and praise. Perhaps they all received $5,000 checks from the film studio.","

"ivanmessimilos","29 May 2021","A great ending to one of the best trilogies of the last twenty years. The film is visually beautiful and the CGI effects are amazing. This is especially seen in scenes with monkeys, and that's every scene in the movie. The vast majority of the dialogue is not done through standard conversation but vocal language, which may seem a little awkward, but the film didn't suffer at all because of it. Monkeys have numerous layers just like humans. The emphasis is on them, not on people, which is even logical given the story. The film contains a great combination of drama and action. I also liked what it has to do with the cult Planet of the Apes (which is one of my favorite movies) so we can freely call this a prequel trilogy. Great job director Reeves, I can't wait for his next project. I rarely see such a good connection through all three films. The downside is the title, which is technically inaccurate and could change some people's expectations. In fact, the last sequel is more of a War than this one. In some ways, the film surprised me because I didn't think it would go in that direction. Great proposal for a marathon: watch first this prequel trilogy and then Planet of the Apes from 1968 with Charlton Heston.","

"TheVictoriousV","24 January 2019","""Human get sick. Ape get smart. Human kill ape."" That is where the final story begins. Matt Reeves' War for the Planet of the Apes starts at a point where any hope of peace between the dwindling human race and the increasingly intelligent apes has vanished. It has been hailed as a modern masterpiece and while I will not go that far in my verdict, I can see why viewers would find that this one stands out amongst the usual summer movies.The leader of the apes is Caesar, once again portrayed via state-of-the-art motion-capture by Andy Serkis, and the force of humans they are primarily up against is led by a figure known simply as The Colonel (Woody Harrelson, fantastic as usual). After this ruthless officer invades the jungle-based safe haven of Caesar's followers, killing his wife and child in the process, Caesar elects to seek him out while the other apes search for another sanctuary, rumored to lie beyond the wastelands, where the humans never travel.He is joined by such fellow apes as the wise Maurice (Karin Konoval) and later a human child nick-named ""Nova"" (Amiah Miller) who has mysteriously lost the ability to speak. I was expecting to see more Internet-based complaints with regards to how the most important female character in the film doesn't say anything, but I suppose it's less obvious when the only characters with bigger roles are non-human. Also, I imagine the recent Doctor Who announcement has given the opinion-having web crusaders other things to think about.I must say, though, that the decision of showing this film exclusively from the point-of-view of the apes was the right one, especially considering the walking clichés that all the non-Oldman human beings were back in Dawn (I needn't remind anyone of Mr. ""I'm The A-hole"", capital T intentional). Also interesting is the fact that not all of the chimps, gorillas, and orangutans have mastered speech yet and are thus forced to communicate via gestures, if at all.I was surprised at how much of the film was conveyed either via sign language or in complete silence, noting that this sort of patience is not normally expected from the audience of a summer blockbuster. There were some moments where we got subtitles even though the characters didn't seem to do much of anything with their hands, and at some points Caesar would respond verbally to sign language occurring outside of his peripheral vision, but I admired the minimalism all the same.Another thing that has always set the Apes trilogy apart from most modern garden-variety blockbusters is the characterizations. I maintain that Caesar the Ape is probably one of the most intriguing and complex characters of recent mainstream cinema, thanks both to the writing and Andy Serkis; even at his most vengeful, we understand his wrath because we have seen his suffering (plus, it may be part of his increasingly human mind), and we can believe his status as a respected leader to his ""people"" because we know his courage and sacrifices.The next thing is, as you won't be shocked to learn, the outright astonishing effects, which have only gotten better and better with each film. And it isn't just in terms of the flawlessly natural movements of the animals or the way their bodies interact with the environments. As my dad confirmed after a local screening, they've also improved the lighting issues of the last chapter and opted for physically based rendering instead of ""tweaking"" everything until you can see all the little details of the textures, even in scenes where it wouldn't match the rest of the lighting. In War it looks bafflingly good and it is never once blatantly obvious where the CGI ends and the physically real objects begin.Sure there are some stupidly plot convenient moments, instances of questionable geography (I don't know where in America this takes place that the characters can travel from a desert to a snowy pine forest within a seemingly short time), one downright jarring product placement, and a few remaining character clichés such as the ""Five Man Band"" Caesar puts together once he vows to hunt down The Colonel, complete with a ""Sixth Ranger"" in the form of a cowardly chimpanzee called ""Bad Ape"" (Steve Zahn). There was also a point near the end where the human side began to seem a little too overtly evil and I detected some not too subtle allusions to Trump's ""Adolf-ian America"" wherein the fascist humans are constructing a wall at the expense of the apes and there comes a time where we must ask ourselves who the REAL Mexicans are.Luckily, they saved it somewhat during a conversation scene between Caesar and The Colonel, where we more clearly understand why The Colonel does as he does and how he fears a sort of ""great replacement"", as I've elected to call it to make it even more topical. War for the Planet of the Apes is still an inordinately complex and thoughtful action film (especially for one that happens to star Simians with machine guns) which also boasts top-class visual effects, a powerful score by Michael Giacchino, great photography throughout the whole show, characters as memorable as they are intriguing, peak performances, and a few interesting references to the original Planet of the Apes that make me hope this is not just the end of the reboot trilogy, but of the whole franchise.When Caesar fell to his knees outside The Colonel's fortress as though he were about to shout ""you maniacs"", I felt that the circle was complete.","

I might have to rewatch ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"", but, apart from the effects and the performances, specially Andy Serkis - he really is out of this world - there's not much else to hold the film, that really suffers from a thin plot where many incongruences can be found. Its what you'd expect from a tentpole blockbuster but it can elevate itself beyond that so keep that in mind if you're gonna give it a watch.","

Now for a movie to work you need a really strong villain. And Woody Harrelson has that charisma to pull it off. He also has a very memorable scene very early on to justify that status and solidify him in that more than evil role.Unfortunately this cannot be sustained throughout. Still while he may lose some of his drive and certain predictable things happen, there is a lot of Drama and a lot of Action happening to keep you on the edge of your seat. The effects get better with every movie of course. And overall the new PotA movies do justice to the legacy of the old ones, who surely will look outdated to some.","

"davidgee","25 July 2017","Not a lot to say about this. There's a limit to how much magic today's over-done CGI can inject into to a franchise that's run out of steam. Caesar (Andy Serkis), the thinking man's King Kong, takes the last band of apes to a mining colony run by the vicious Colonel Woody Harrelson, where Caesar's son is among the prisoners. The war is not just between the slave-apes and their masters (humans and 'collaborator' gorillas) but also between the colony and another army of humans who've survived the apocalyptic virus.There are pleasing nods to other movies outside the genre. Some early snowscape panoramas reminded me of David Lean's awesome cinematography in DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, and the prison colony is a cross between Mad Max's THUNDERDOME and Kurtz's jungle hideout in APOCALYPSE NOW. Woody Harrelson's 'transition' from monster to misfit makes no sense, and the humanity of the 'good' apes contrasted to the inhumanity of the humans is ladled on much too thickly. The sequels to the 1968 Charlton Heston PLANET OF THE APES became progressively dafter, so we must hope they shelve the franchise back in the studio archive for a decade or two now that this remake trilogy is complete.","

"Sabre-El","8 December 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes picks up from where the previous two movies had left: the intelligent apes are increasing in numbers and the humans are afraid of them. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the first installment, was a masterful piece of art. It mainly focused on two characters, Caesar, the protagonist of this movie, and his 'keeper'/friend. It was very detailed, focussing on the relationship between the two and all that fit well with how the narrative unfolded. The second installment had a similar formula of keeping the story detailed and it worked well for it was well.That's why I had a lot of hope for this movie. Unfortunately, that very formula that made me love the previous parts, just doesn't work with this one. War of the Planet of the Apes starts out just fine, but then, just in a few minutes, the story slows down a lot: each scene is very detailed, trying to give its viewers a feel of its characters. The thing is, we already know about many characters from its previous parts, so we're not that interested about that any more. Many apes haven't developed speech, so most of the movie is in sign language. While it is 'realistic' and I give plaudits to the makers for this, it adds to the slowness of the movie, making it boring, as one just can't understand what's going on. On top of all that, the movie is quite predictable. Add up all these factors and the fact that the movie runs for more than 2 hours, it becomes slightly difficult to watch. I literally had to fast forward a few scenes because I just wanted the movie to end.All that said, the movie does have its positives. The CGI is amazing and the apes really look as if they exist. The movie might be boring, but it is still a good piece of art in terms of story-telling and one can tell a lot of effort went into it.\Recommendation: don't watch it if you can't stand slow movies and don't have your hopes up based on the previous two installments","

The first - Rise......oTPoTA was good but not great, the 2nd Dawn.......oTPoTA was a bit better, and this is very good, can't wait to see what the next is like.The reason it is so good, it is well directed and has some serious drama, the CGI is getting better and the acting was great. The photography was excellent with beautiful scenery and good sets. It was a bit long and dragged a little in the middle, but not by much, and not enough to lower the rating, for the most part it was paced very well. It was the story and screenplay that was the best, the extra impact of the virus was interesting, as was the relationship of the different characters. All in all a very good watch.Ignore all the negative reviews on here, we all know that the world is full of idiots, and a thousand of them must have registered on here! If you are only interested in flash bang films, don't watch and ignore this review, but if you want to view an excellent, well made film, with serious drama and a great story, this might be your cup of tea.","

If you are going to call a film "" War for.."" then It is best to actually stage a war rather than a battle for sympathy. As much Disney's Incredible Journey as anything else, WFTPA follows a group of apes led by Caesar in a mission to scout out an advancing army of humans only to find the rest of their ape kind have already been captured in a battle that we don't get to see. A poster showing apes charging towards troops in bogus Barnum and Bailey hucksterism ie a lie.All the positive reviews have focused on the pixelated puppetry of motion caption and the CGI rendering. Yes it is excellent...to an extent. I was totally convinced human actors bought these characters to life. The apes are so real that it just drew attention to the way the virus that give them intelligence also made them act out of character. Gorillas, for example, are not aggressive killers, orangutans aren't wise old men and where are the bonk crazy Bonobos? (They never get a look-in in the Apes movies - too busy shagging I guess)Woody Harrelson plays a psycho human supremacist fighting to eliminate a mutation in the virus that is making humans speechless. But, only minutes in to his performance, I realized that since Donald Trump's election, I was tired of watching aggressive, racist Americans. Harrelson's character is just another of the many clichés of which the film is entirely made.There are some very specific quibbles: the aged 'Bad Ape' isn't the comic relief the makers think. His back story is confused and his former home : a zoo, quarantine center, prison looks nothing like any of these. Since when were zoos just big cages? The concentration camp is strangely under populated with human guards and those that are there fail to spot hundreds of apes vanishing down all too conveniently already made escape tunnels. There's no emotional investment in the human vs human conflict and the climax (spoiler alert)in which everyone bar a few chimps is wiped out in an avalanche is unexpected and narratively ridiculous. It is as if the writer couldn't think how to resolve the established conflict. More to the point it undermines the mythic story arch - that's how most of humanity died? In snow? Perhaps the 'white out' was supposed to be satirical but it is unlikely. Even the building of a wall (to keep out humans) fails to resonate.So what we are left with is a human family revenge drama in ape form. Not even the nods to the original Apes movies raise this film beyond a character piece. Again this focus on family is incongruous. Chimpanzees in the wild are promiscuous. So not only have they developed the ability to speak and think, the Apes here have also mutated into middle class family units. And again, the reality of the rendering calls attention to the unreality of the fictional universe. In a way, the original prosthetics and performances were better because they called attention to the satirical intentions of many of the scripts (particularly Planet and Escape).Taken as a whole, this film is just dull. CGI rendering and motion caption may have progressed, but story telling remains in the past.","

"ericstevenson","6 August 2017","This initially came off as too long of a movie for me, but it ended up being well worth the length. The best part is probably this great twist that's introduced that sets up a brand new mythology for the series. In this movie, it's revealed that some of the remaining humans are starting to lose the ability to talk, including this one girl whom the apes befriend. What happens is that the virus is apparently mutating and now the surviving humans are starting to lose their intelligence, reverting to ape like behavior themselves! The scene where the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) explains this is to Caesar is probably the best part in the movie.Koga was a great villain for the previous movie and it's great how we at least get him alluded to here. Even Caesar himself admits that he's starting to become like him, sincerely wanting to kill the Colonel. My only complaint is that there wasn't really a war of any kind here. It didn't have any more action than the previous installment. It was still very well written and they even explicitly mention ""Ape Shall Not Kill Ape"". Some apes do in fact work for the humans. I just wished there were more sympathetic humans here. ***1/2","

"JWick23","10 March 2021","A perfect trilogy. It's rare for a sequel to be as good as the original and even rarer for it to have a consistent trilogy. War for the Planet of the Apes was a satisfiable conclusion to a great run.Solid story with some minor flaws but has some of the elements from the prequel. Characters are good, tbh it's not as good as the prequel but still are decent and have their own quriks, the most interesting being the Colonel and Nova, two humans who are tragic and sad because of ther origins. Very good musical score and visuals were astounding. The music wasn't as good as the prequel but still was good enough for me to be captivate by certain scenes.Overall an enjoyable movie.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..","

"movieswithgreg","25 June 2018","Good lord this was slow. I do appreciate ""slow"" films, foreign stuff, art stuff, character stuff, etc, but this, at its best, is trying to be some inaccessible allegory that I had to struggle to comprehend, or -- it's what it appears to be -- a movie that lost its message through muddled writing and misguided re-writes or heavy handed script doctoring and myopic producing. It just CRAWLS. Aimlessly. This is the third of an ever-worsening series of reboots. The first one was worthy. The second was fun but empty. This third? I'm so glad I followed my instincts and refused to pay a theater ticket to see it. The message or theme is simple, and repeated -- humans are mean spirited savages, apes are noble savages. Yeah, we got it the first time. It's also trying to be a poorly executed morality play on ""us vs them,"" on ""natives vs immigrants,"" and tribalism based on race. There's even a ""Wall"" featured. In ten years, will any viewer remember what ""the wall"" was about?  Yeah yeah, it's an ever-important message, but it requires better execution and exposition in this day and age. What's next -- GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, with the groom-to-be the human, and his fiance and parents apes?","

"benderofgender","2 September 2017","The original idea was to symbolize the upcoming race war. The movie was very boring with the monkey's talking in whispers and sign language. Keep watching their lips and sit very close, or you'll miss what they say. Nothing inspiring to make life seem good. The first one was good, but these others just have political messages. The last Planet of the Apes was to try to make you hate guns. If you do see this and get bored, think about the Pizza you can eat when it's over, that would be more inspiring.","

"Rightopinionguys","7 June 2023","War for the Planet of the Apes- a movie that captures all emotions in one epic finale. Honestly, if there was an 11/10 option, I would rate it that without a shadow of a doubt. At a faster pace than 'Rise' but a slower pace than 'Dawn', this movie sits very comfortably at the top of the Planet of the Apes trilogy, and at second in command to the original planet of the apes in the whole franchise rankings.The music is arguably Michael Giacchino's finest work, and could stand level with the music to 'Up' which won an Oscar for best soundtrack. In terms of acting, Woody Harrelson does a doe did job of playing the awful Colonel, and his backstory was well written and thought of. Andy Serkis, as always, does what he does best in terms of CGI. The storyline is golden and has definitely been deeply run through, and Matt Reeves as a director has done very, very well. What can I say, this movie is excellent!Consider every category, and know that I rate all of them 10/10.","

"sevastokrator","16 July 2017","To me, the banality of the film is insulting. I don't know with which sequel to compare it first, with Highlander II or The Matrix Revolutions.Although both Rise and Dawn had their flaws, I wasn't going to nitpick because I loved the films so much that I kept turning on the suspension of disbelief whenever necessary. So I really didn't expect that War could in any way disappoint me if they only kept the pace. But I was wrong. The story was poor, plot unconvincing, characters not developed enough and with idiotic motives and behavior, ""dramatic"" scenes lacking any maturity whatsoever.Despite the fact that the film is not about any kind of war, and that the trailer is misleading and a total lie. Yes, there is no war in the film, and especially no war between apes and humans - the only thing that resembled war had already happened in the Dawn. The film is a mixture of Schindler's List and Prison Break, while failing both. So, expect Scofield brothers with a Jar Jar Binks alike side-kick, trying to escape a Nazi death camp, and you'll get the picture. Pure luck is the main factor of literally everything significantly important happening. All characters, including Caesar, are reduced to total idiots surfing on the waves of ludicrous decisions followed by lucky circumstances.It's a shame to rate a film with such magnificent score, scenery, shots, and CGI with a 3/10, but it is just beyond my comprehension that they couldn't employ a decent writer. Those were the shallowest 2 hours I spent in the cinema lately, and I especially feel cheated on because, to me, they ruined something that could have been a great Sci-Fi trilogy of the 2010's.I will not go on about the nods to 1968 original, nor the forcibly put sub-plots to explain how some events in the original film were possible (a virus that causes loss of speech in one day, I mean, come on!) Or Koba's followers who are now willing to become humiliated human slaves and ape-killers, because oh they hate Caesar so much. Come on, the point of joining Koba in the first place was irrational and uncompromising hatred towards humans! I could go on, almost every single motive for doing anything in the film is ridiculous.Perhaps I am being biased, I admit I am watching in disbelief all these enthusiastic and positive reviews. But I cannot find a single positive thing about the film. To me, it defiled the trilogy and made me sorry for seeing Rise back in 2011 to begin with, and getting hooked up to the story.And perhaps it is not that awful in the end, but missing the opportunity to finish a great piece of work with a decent final touch is worse than making a poor one from the start.","

"pascalbourelier","29 September 2018","This will be short, but the film in the current Hollywood landscape is a rare Gem. Pacing, acting, introduction and writing are at the top of what I've seen since a long time!I missed it in theaters, because the second opus was bad (to my personal view), even if I have always supported the Planet of the Apes series ! I regret it sorely now that I have seen this (last?) opus.If hollywood and overall audiences were able to see true great films, this one is by any standard one of those great film that brings heart before actions, do not push science where it is not needed, has authentic character and though is not exempt of mistakes and caricature on the side of the colonel, it never feels so pushy that you disconnect with the movie.So, here is my militant 10/10 and a big thank you to Matt Reeves for making a ture Planet of the Apes as we longed for so long (40 years roughly, 17 years for others!) !","

"SilverDiamond1987","27 August 2017","You know, the first chapter ""The Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a good beginning. It was a solid action adventure. A modernized version of the old ""ape"" movies. When the second movie was released, people almost loved it, so the movie got lots of praise and admiration as a brilliant movie. However, if you ask me, it was seriously dull by a lazy editing and storytelling. All those trailers and posters of the second film (apes grabbing weapons etc.) gave us a promise of lots of action and suspense, but actually it was not, that's why it was a boring movie. While the most of the second movie takes place in an ape shelter with an imperceptible story, this third movie mostly takes place in a military base! This is because the director takes the easy way out while telling us the story. The third movie is the same, maybe worse, I don't know, but I can figure out easily that why a lot of audiences felt cheated. It is because the last two movies were misleading. Look at the poster of this movie! You can see clearly a grand battle between apes and humans, but the director cannot tell us this war in a wider scale, instead, most of the movie takes place in a military base/internment camp this time, so? We expect lots of action, adventure, a worldwide battle, but we get stuck in that military base and we cannot escape from there as audiences! The film starts like ""The Predator"", but after this promise, it gets worse and worse. We get lost inside the weird plot of the movie. This movie has not a proper beginning, a proper development and a proper end/climax. It feels like a semi documentary at times, but it is not. This is not a human vs. ape story. This is a boring movie about captured apes, killer apes, apes with a good heart etc. This movie, also the previous one have a pace issue! The first chapter was perfect for this, but the last two movies have a serious pace problem. It is somewhere between a semi drama and semi documentary and an action adventure film. Also, now we have a second Apocalypse Now ""homage"" after ""King Kong: The Skull Island"", but despite Woody Harrelson is such an amazing actor, his villain character here is not intimidating, influential or dramatic. In the movie, there is always a glimpse or feeling that something is going to happen, but that moment never comes. There is a special forces unit in white who reminds me storm-troopers in Star Wars, but wait a minute! They get wasted in the plot. There is a virus danger added into the plot, but it gets ridiculous and pointless. And I have never been a fan of Caesar. Yes, he is an alpha male, he is a leader, he is not evil etc. but he is overrated. I don't adore or have admiration for this ape. He is not like Dr. Zira in the original film. In these movies, humans are depicted as villains and apes are depicted as heroes to root for, but this doesn't work here actually. Is this a sentimental movie? Will you break into tears? Hell, No! If you ask me, even Tim Burton's disappointing The Planet of the Apes version is better than these movies. This movie could have been an epic finale.","

"fcabanski","18 October 2017","The original Planet of The Apes movies were social commentaries. In them, the ape society mirrored human society, and there were good apes and bad apes. Watching those movies, you could see both the good and bad in people and apes, standing in for people.But the re-boot series of movies changes the social commentary - America bad, terrorists good.It's no accident or coincidence that the apes seek to travel to the desert where they will be free of the evil Americans who want the apes dead. After all, Hollyweirdos think the mad Muslim terrorists just want to be left alone, and they're fighting for their freedom against evil America.History shows that's not true, but Hollyweird leftists don't care much for real history.Early in the movie, the evil American colonel kills Caesar's wife and son. That's evil! It's portrayed as evil. Not long after that, Caesar kills a little girl's father. He never expresses a moment of sorrow. He never questions his own actions, even in light of just living through someone killing his family. But he's good.Get it? Desert people who use guerrilla tactics to fight the evil Americans - aka mad Muslim terrorists - are good. Americans who use military tactics to fight for their survival are evil.That's the movie in a nut shell. That message is wrapped in absurd battle scenes with apes fighting off well armed soldiers - rocket launchers, body armor, night vision goggles, instant radio communication - with the apes using home made smoke bombs, spears, and a few modern weapons.Ther's no ape violating ""ape must not kill ape"" in this movie. That was gone in the second reboot movie. There's only the warped message - America bad, desert dwelling terrorists good.","

"pat-495-739723","6 August 2017","This movie is absolute trash. I am a huge fan of the franchise, including the first two installments of the reboot. This film was incredibly disappointing. The plot was almost non-existent, the pacing was all over the place, the tone kept juggling and the development was forced. It felt like they had no clue how to end the trilogy, so they threw together a ton of walking inserts, and landscape shots with sprinkles of action sequences sparingly used throughout. Slow movies do not bother me but pretentious garbage like this film is entirely not watchable. The solid cinematography and good use of CGI to not make up for the nonsensical plot. Do yourself a favor and wait on this one. Believe all the bad reviews, I was anxiously awaiting the release of the film, only to be let down. Biggest disappointment of the summer by far.","

"kermitkid","30 March 2020","A good prequel trilogy! Take that, Star Wars! Looking at this through the context of the original from 1968, it's hard to know who to root for. The humans in this are horrible to the apes, but you think ""Well, they kind of deserve this, because they do the same thing to us in the original."" And yet you still sympathize with them. We're rooting for the bad guys and yet...we're not. The motion capture on the apes is amazing! Not since ""Avatar"" has there been such impressive effects. (Although I may redact that statement after I see ""Valerian"", but we'll see...) The detail on each ape is exquisite. If it weren't for the apes riding horseback and wielding guns, you would think this was a nature documentary. Woody Harrelson does a great job, although at some points it does feel like a repeat of his character from ""The Hunger Games."" As far as who to root for, it's hard to decide. Neither side is definitively good or evil. Some of the humans are horrible, but some just want to leave the apes alone, and have the war come to them. Some of the apes are even on the human side. The action sequences in this were way over the top (in a good way.) I honestly don't know how this film could be improved. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Most times I say ""I really enjoyed the movie except for this, this and this,"" but that didn't happen here. The emotion was so well conveyed. It makes you hate your own species and cry over a bunch of CGI Apes. Kind of ridiculous out loud, but it's so well written and acted, I wouldn't be suprised if this gets nominated for a few Oscars when awards season comes around.

"jdavenpo","19 July 2017","Plot was just missing everything, no character development, you have no backstory or connection with any character but then the movie would drag out every scene as if we were supposed to be at the edge of our seat every second, except I wasn't. The bad character development and over dramatic scene making creates the perfect movie to fall asleep in, you will start feeling bored and exhausted after only 20 minutes and since it is a long movie you will either feel this way the whole movie like I did or you will be lucky enough to watch this pile of garbage on the plane where you can wake up and the movie will be over. The only reason I gave it a score of 2 is because there has to be at least one movie out there that is worse than this one. It started bad, had a bad plot, had no drama, no character development, had horrible attempts at tension, horrible solutions to problems, it all ends exactly as your 8 year old would have predicted, maybe the Producers preschooler wrote the plot. Yes it was that bad. Humans and apes? battle for the planet? I wish, except it wasn't, it was just pathetic.Oh and the worst part is the embarrassingly high reviews for this stinker. Too bad the Internet has become overrun with armies of paid shills, This movie, were it to be honestly rated by people that actually have seen it, would likely be less than 2 because I gave it a two out of pity.","

Caesar's death doesn't feel forced, it was truly beautiful. This was one of the few movies that I've ever cried in.
I love the story about how there's not many humans left on the planet and the apes have basically become the humans of Earth by the end of the film.
One thing I love about all the films is that it makes you love the apes and you really start to hate most the humans. It's truly an amazing film.

"ironhorse_iv","16 July 2017","It's time to wage war! Ape-Calypse Now Style! This is the story of 2017's 'War for the Planet of the Apes', which pits, Caesar (Motion Capture & Voiced by Andy Serkis) & his ape colony, against an army of human, led by a ruthless, Colonel McCullough (Woody Harrelson) following the events of 2014's 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, despite the film's title being about the all-out war between apes and humans, the majority of the film is centered on intense, dramatic moments between Caesar and McCullough in a prison settling. While, some people might find, that boring, because of the lack of action, I have to disagree; as those scenes did led to a lot of conflict, between the belief of total authoritarian, and swore allegiance to Colonel as a mean to control the means of the production & the populace versus the belief of working rights & unitization of the four species of ape, under consul leadership under Caesar. Not only does, these open defiance moments, help the film, but it also remind me of prison films like 1963's 'The Great Escape', 2001's 'The Last Castle', 1967's 'Cool Hand Luke' and 1994's 'Shawshank Redemption'. It also seem to me, that the film took influence from much darker prison drama films like 1993's 'Schindler's List' & 1997's 'Amistad', with its harsh allegory of race relations. While, some people might get offended by the anthropomorphism & the sinister portrayal of humanity. For the most part, people understood the story, it was going for, and let it, in. Even if, most of the movie is downright gritty gloom and doom, war & cruelty. It's clearly not for all children, with it intense sequences of violence and death. Lots of frighten imagery. Despite that, the action scenes in the film, were just as good as the prison, rebellion scene. The opening credit, alone is worth, the ticket price. This is, by far, one of my favorite movies, in the reboot, 'Planet of the Apes' series, because of the action. However, there is a few nitpicking flaws with it. One is the fact that the 3D was rarely used. So check it out, in 2D. No need to spent more money, when you don't have to. Another is the many of plot-holes, like why didn't the Colonel, just outright kill Caesar, when he first enter the prison yards? You would really think, that would end, the rebellion, before it even started, since the prisoners didn't know that he was there. Plus, it's not like, it didn't stop him, from trying to do it, before. Unless, his brain skills are so devolution by the Simian Flu that he forgot, the reasons, why he was going to kill Caesar, than I find, this act, very jarring, for somebody that favors stopping any sign of the infected with a dime of a hat. Also, it also seem to me, that his prison isn't well guarded, seeing how the Northern Army will be, heading their way, any minute. After all, a little girl was able to sneak in, and give food & water to the apes, in a long scene of time. It just doesn't add up. Despite that, Woody Harrelson was great in the sinister role. He really did look, like he could do, another action movie, at his age. Yet, there was another problem with the story besides the Colonel's odd judgments; which was, the unneeded comedy from Bad Ape (Motion Capture & Voiced by Steve Zahn). He was borderline, 'Jar Jar Binks' of annoying. It just doesn't mixed well, with the serious tone of the rest of the movie. Anyways, despite that, I do like the references and Easter eggs to the original series, throughout the film. That was fun to see. Also, I love, the story is very similar to the fifth and final entry of the original series, 1973's 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes', in tone, but is different enough, not to be a direct remake, as it does not fit into that series' continuity that well. Hopefully, the whole Icarus subplot would make sense, once it's introduce, in a future series of films. However, there is a part of me, that doesn't want any more films to continue this storyline. As I find, this reboot trilogy of movies, to be amazing on its own right, from start to finish. I really like, how the three movies establish, Caesar in 2011's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', developed him in ""Dawn', and had the perfect closure for that character, in this film. These three films really does cement him as a seminal figure in the fictional ape history. It would really be, hard to watch, another film, in the series, without the character, in it, or the actor that plays him, Andy Serkis, whom probably the best CGI model motion capture actor of all time. It would be a letdown. Despite, what happens, in future films, at least, I can say, this movie end the three film, very perfectly in a grand finale. The CGI work for the apes was amazing. The cinematography by Michael Seresin was breath-taking with the beaches and snowy mountains. They really do look like, they really are, there. I also have to give credit to the music by composer Michael Giacchino. It was excellent and touching. 'Nova's theme' alone will make you, cry, when hearing it. Without spoiling the end of this, Matt Reeves's film, too much. The last shot of the movie, will leave you in silence. It's that powerful. Overall: This movie is a great popcorn movie that needs to seem. So, stop monkeying around! Go see it! It's worth your time.","

"LloydBayer","12 July 2017","I made a bold statement while reviewing 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes by calling that film the evolution of cinema. And before that I called 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes a ground breaking vehicle in cinematic storytelling. Yet both films asked the same question – will xenophobia lead to the destruction of humanity? In fact, this very question was initiated as a social metaphor in the 1968 original starring Charlton Heston. Now 50 years down the line, returning director Matt Reeves has the answer, and it's a fact we've known since the beginning of civilization. Touted as the finale to an epic trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes is not your typical tent pole summer film. But it's all about computer generated apes, you say; Apes that talk in a setup that's all implausible science-fiction. Yes, and so are superhero films. And while we were sheepishly distracted by wondering which superhero character will get his/her own sequel, the Apes franchise was shaping out to be a rare Hollywood triumph in more ways than initially perceived. While Rise was a runaway hit in 2011, its story was about humanity's unintended conflict with a new race of super intelligent apes. Dawn in 2014 intensified that conflict before concluding that however hateful humans can be, peace is always an option. That little chance of peace is thrown out the window with War for the Planet of the Apes. Thus begins a visually stunning effects driven Hollywood blockbuster, and it doesn't get any better than this. Thanks to the breathtaking motion performance technology, anyone watching this film will have no doubt that the apes in this film are anything but computer generated creatures. The visuals are that good, if not the best in the franchise. Yet at the core is a strong emotional tug that transcends general expectations of a blockbuster this big. Take for instance that the terrific yet intense action scenes in this film are dispensed with controlled measure in favour of a richer and layered complexity in the storytelling. While it would have been all too easy to place apes on one side and humans on the other and light a fuse in between, Reeves concludes this trilogy with a poignant yet prophetic and equally poetic ode to humanity's self-inflected destruction. And personifying this dark heart of mankind is Woody Harrelson as a Colonel who has abandoned his ranks to exterminate apes led by our beloved Caesar. That very line, in a film pitting humans versus apes is exactly how the audience will react by rooting for another species instead of our own.Harrelson's Colonel (with more than enough homage to Marlon Brando's Col Kurtz in the still haunting Apocalypse Now) is a scary portrayal of just how ruthlessly pathological humans can be in endangering another species, or for that matter, another race of humans. While that is already known, the greatest achievement in War for the Planet of the Apes is in the innumerable social allegories that lead up to the climactic Caesar Vs Colonel showdown. It's worth the wait and the wait is not plagued with the usual bloating of a blockbuster pushing past two hours. Yet even as the story goes from grim to bleak, Steve Zhan as a chimp calling himself 'Bad Ape' injects some much needed humour. But if there is anyone who deserves top credit for this film (and the previous two), it is none other than Andy Serkis in another outstanding delivery as Caesar. No matter however accomplished, not many actors today can do what Serkis does, which is nothing short of breathing life into a digitally rendered character and then making you shed a tear over that character. While it's still a long shot in getting an Academy Award nomination for a motion capture role, what Serkis has achieved is not only colossal for this film but also for the future of cinema. That being said and irrespective of how well this film does during awards season, Serkis along with Reeves have crafted one of the most memorable films of the year. And if this is the series swan song, it is also one of the most heartbreaking and fully accomplished blockbusters of the year. All hail Caesar!","

"NS-movie-reviews","21 August 2022","Five years later this film holds up. It is a well written ending to a trilogy that told a remarkable story. It gets a little slow at times, perhaps a little draggy in spots. But overall, ""War..."" Does an amazing job at doing right by it's characters, answering questions, being emotional and vulnerable, and also acts as a dazzling display of effects and choreography.I'm not sure they truly make movies like this anymore; epic, raw, thought-provoking storytelling within a world of CGI and action. I'm glad to have these movies to go back to.","

"TheMovonka","4 August 2017","To start short and simple, yes the ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" shows no war at all. The misleading title, trailer and even posters let expectations arise to see the conflict of the second movie intensify and peak in an enduring battle between last human armies and the settled ape fighters to establish their colony for good. Well, you don't get thatAccording to this aspect, I understand a lot of disappointment in the critics, but let me tell you, audience trades in that expectation with an intense emotional experience about the desperate fight for survival of the apes, led by their liberator from hour one, Caesar. This is why in Austria and Germany, this movie is called ""Planet of the Apes: Survival"" and suits much better.You feel with the always on the run colony of apes, as Woody Harrelson hunts down the enemy race of wild animals in his perception in a classically established psychopath Apocalypse Now manner as the Colonel of a separatist human army. As he drifts away to madness, long and slow pacing scenes as well as high class CGI close ups bound viewers with the fear of the chased ones. As the brutality narrows down to single destinies of ape characters, fear changes to will for vengeance and the guerrilla fight for a better future of apes begins.Here the movie establishes the pace and structure of how should inferior technology beat the crazy humans with all their military power. Consequently, as war is brutal, there is no Rambo story to see the good fighting the bad, but a story taking you deeper and deeper into the desperation of being chased and jailed. Suddenly Caesar and his tribe find themselves captured and enslaved in a concentration camp, mixing the movie temporary with Schindlers List and Unbroken moments. But as apes are strong together, the fight for survival continues for a better future, for which Caesar would sacrifice everything, even his principles.But let's be honest, there are obvious issues with the plot. From the very slow speed to allow strong bindings with ape characters and a good side of the human race, embodied by a lost lonely girl who shows a solid performance to enrich empathy, the movie takes a long road until the big dramatic final. Slow motion and long dialogues dominate over swift fight scenes like in part two. As this is subjective to like it or not, still some problem occur in the script. Entering a front door, when you follow as guerrilla troop is linked to high risk of loss. Even without military education the apes could know better how to avoid being seen. On the other hand, entering a concentration camp, leaving it or hundreds of apes disappearing out of a cage is not recognized by any guard who should be trained? I don't think so And yes, the final has its peak as a second human army is just deleted by a coincidentally useful avalanche. That was an easy script move to shorten the end in favor of the apes. But well, to be honest, history is written with such coincidence, and even if it looks ridiculous, would anybody have thought the Spanish armada is beaten by British thanks to storms and winds or did anybody complain about that in Dunkirk the German troops stopped to march on? Still it happened like that, so you just can accept the ""history of the planet of the apes"" by the creators of that movie even if there would have been more elegant ways of pursue that development of the story.Fighting against those harsh critics, giving 1 out of 10 stars, just because of the stated issue points is absolutely absurd. Still the movie is well paced, breathtakingly executed and well-acted. Not meeting the strong expectations of certain viewers does not make it a bad movie I would say. But please go and decide for yourself. You are now well prepared to enjoy or avoid the big final of the Planet of the Apes Trilogy.","

"CinemaClown","18 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is an impressive entry in the rebooted Planet of the Apes series, and along with the previous two chapters makes up for one of contemporary cinema's finest trilogies. A strong, epic & emphatic end to a saga that began with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it is a moving, meditative & morally complex blockbuster that lives up to its enormous hype, and also cements its status, and that of its trilogy, as one of the most powerful sagas to ever unfold on the silver screen.","

"breheneyjames","15 July 2017","Wow. First off let me just say how excited I am for Matt Reeves to direct 'The Batman'. He took the reigns of this franchise from Rupert Wyatt after 'Rise' and really made it his own and elevated it with 'Dawn'. I also believe he elevated it again with 'War' which closes out this superb prequel trilogy.There is not a wasted shot in this film. Everyone of them is composed with an impressive attention to detail that just leaves you in awe. It is clear that Matt Reeves is a strong visual director and he works with his cinematographer Michael Seresin very well here to deliver some of the best visuals of the year so far.There are many inspirations on display in this film that Matt Reeves has talked about from 'The Ten Commandments', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Even the first appearance of Caesar in the movie has his colony of apes parting to make way for their leader a la the red seas for Moses. Also the score by Michael Giacchino is the perfect companion for this story and has a 'Seven Samurai' feel to it.The story is powerful and emotionally resonant thanks to full bodied characters and a stunning performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar. If there was ever a time for him to receive an Academy Award nomination for his work this would be it. Steve Zahn is also fantastic as Bad Ape who works wonderfully as comedic relief in an otherwise grim and dreary film. Other performances of note are Woody Harrelson as The Colonel who gives you every reason to resent him but is also someone who is affected by personal tragedy (which leads to a moving scene where Caesar empathizes with him) and Amiah Miller as Nova who says a lot without speaking a word. The 'War' that the title refers to is not a physical war but a war of ideals between both Caesar and The Colonel and within Caesar himself. So don't expect an all out action set-piece a minute war movie. It's a much more personal, dramatic and emotional story and the film is all the more better for it. A perfect movie to round out a perfect trilogy. Apes. Together. Strong.","

"slhma-86182","13 October 2017","I was pleasantly surprised by War for the Planet of the Apes. The plot,character development and script are impressive. The acting by everyone but Woody is stellar.Woody's acting left something to be desired,hence the 8 stars instead of ten.I thought Woody phoned it in and I KNOW he could do better. The story continues the saga of Caesar and his followers and friends on their mission to ensure their survival.I understand why racists and egghead Trump voters would hate this movie but its too bad for them.This third installment of the Planet of the Apes left the second installment in the dust.It's a near masterpiece.","

"Leofwine_draca","27 May 2020","WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the third of this lacklustre trilogy of revamps and hopefully the last. You're better off sticking with the originals, because the only thing good about these films is the calibre of the special effects; unsurprisingly they're better than ever this time around, and you don't question any of the simians for a moment. Sadly, the trade-off comes in the sloppy writing and random focusing on silly sentimentality, with the momentum often grinding to a halt to deliver one excruciating tear-jerking moment after another. It's silly and embarrassing, sitting ill at ease with the pantomime action found elsewhere in the movie.","

"eyeintrees","20 November 2017","You know, the first movies were fantastic. This onE is just ORDINARY but worse, clichéd ordinary!!! Actually, I'll call this movie bad mediocre.You keep hoping for the first one and a quarter hours that something special will reveal itself but don't worry, it won't, you can rest assured that if you find yourself yawning, scratching, hoping it will end soon, that it won't do that either... it just goes on and on and on in dark, broody, miserable, depressing, nothingness with a bad dialogue to match.And the thing about the little girl... the apes kill her father but that doesn't seem to sink in... actually, this movie is just plain stupid, filled with silly blunders and ordinary acting. How the heck, after the brilliance of the other movies, did they get this one so wrong? And there's no war. Just a dark, broody mess and lots of blood and dead things. Save your money. Spend on a coffee or a cuppa tea and cake.The only reason I rated it as high as 4 is because I have always liked Cesar so much and the lovey big orange guy who talks to him.","

"Personian","28 July 2020","I detect an earthy/Woody bouquet, with hints of Lord of the Rings, Apocalypse Now, The Stand, 28 Days Later, The Great Escape, the Bible -- New Testament and Old -- and Shakespeare. Snowy, gritty mouth feel. Pairs well with epic Westerns and Kurosawa -- although any epic Western pairs well with Kurosawa. ... Actually, there is such a strong unity message here, and so many powerful performances from the motion capture actors, flawless special effects, gorgeous photograpy and epic scope ... it's so beautiful. There is one moment, for instance, in which a character who represents evolution on its way up is dying, and a character who represents evolution on its way down communicates a metaphor to him at that last moment. Something that humanity hadn't yet lost, but which the apes hadn't necessarily learned yet. All the apes gathered around find so much suprising meaning in the gesture, as it sinks in, and we realize what an amazing gift given to a friend at such a time. And it all happens in just a few seconds. Beautiful. The whole film is like that. Slow-going, not something you would want to see outside comfortable circumstances, but well worth the time and concentration. Does not shirk from either realism or thoughtfulness.","

"jcjs333","15 November 2017","The only thing i liked about the flick is some of the photo-jazz. Interesting how some reviewers like to critique other reviewers. I supposed that's natural. Funny, how the one reviewer said he was a coward for not leaving the theater halfway through and weeps for cinema. I get that. Another said the new SpiderMan was trash and can't understand people liking Spiderman and disliking this show. For me, each was junky bunky but for different reasons. The writing and plot were bad but this Planet of the Apes is just old and poor stuff. The first one was enough. Trying to anthropomorphize apes and God and anything else we can think of gets old. Being talked down to by Hollywood gets old with their main purpose, still, money. One monkey has 'stunted jabber' like Hollywood put in the mouths of early cowboy Indian movies, the Zoo Monkey. And, Ceasar is an articulate son of a gun who can communicate with words to all other lesser types who know sign language. Somehow, those not knowing how to speak with voice understand 'voice'. They all utter and it's all utter nonsense. Wishful thinking and humans grappling for some delusional empathy bounces all through the film. There's a phony short of the mark 'empathy' which the movie makers try to be getting at. I saw a little film called 'DOG'S PURPOSE' which was so superior to this film while delivering such a more powerful , empathetic and real interpretation of the whole human vs animal trip. The one ape wondering why pictures were so small when looking through the binoculars was an attempt at humor but was just stupid. That , alone , ought to get one to walk out of a theater. To each their own. I think children, little kids could get something from this flick but just a turn off for me at 74.I wonder if i went out on a date with someone and i hated this show and they loved it would we have much in common? I don't know. Sensibilities are so complex and i don't think reactions and sympathies can be easily measured. I don't understand how anyone can really like this junk with the same vigor someone who loves this show can't understand why i think it's monkey junk. So be it. We can find common ground elsewhere get differing things out of different things. This movie didn't do a thing for me no feeling, no humor nothing interesting going on. The only guy i much like is the dude who was shot dead when he said he was going to put the wood down. Some guy wants to surrender and Caesar shoots him dead. Then, Ceaser shoots a suffering deaf mute. Give me a break!","

"bankofmarquis","15 July 2017","I was pleasantly surprised by the first film in this trilogy - RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.  I was also in the minority when I said I was underwhelmed by the 2nd film of this trilogy - DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.  So when I started hearing the glowing reviews of the 3rd installment of this trilogy, I went into the theaters, folded my arms and said - ""prove it"".And...it didn't.Do you see the intense expressions on the characters in the picture above.  That pretty much sums up this film - intense.  This is a SERIOUS film about a SERIOUS subject directed in a SERIOUS manner with SERIOUS performances that takes itself very SERIOUSLY.Much like the DCI Cinematic Universe (prior to WONDER WOMAN), I just wanted to tell the filmmakers to ""lighten up"" a bit.  This is a film about APES taking over the world, after all.  I understand that this is an allegory regarding a suppressed race rising up over their suppressors, but it needn't have been so dark and heavy.A large part of this weight is on the very capable shoulders of Andy Serkis' portrayal of the lead Ape, Caesar.  His motion capture performance is very strong and sets the very dark and serious tone for this film.  I hear calls of ""give this man an Oscar, already!"" and, while I don't quite share their fervor, I will agree that it is a very good, very strong performance.Going toe to toe with Serkis' is Woody Harrelson's equally dark and intense portrayal of Caesar's human advisory - ""THE COLONEL"" - as befits his villain with no name, Harrelson's performance is pretty much one note - all dark and intense - with no nuance whatsoever.  The audience has no problem distinguishing the ""Good Guys"" (or in this case Apes"" and the ""Bad Guys"".And that is where I have the biggest problem with this film.  There is no nuance to it.  The humans are BAD and the apes are GOOD.  No middle ground, no wavering.  So when the ultimate battle is setup, there is no doubt as to outcome, so any real tension is diminished.And that would be my 2nd biggest issue.  This really shouldn't have been called WAR for the Planet of the Apes, for there really wasn't any WAR!  It should have been called INTENSE BROODING LEADING TO A BATTLE on the Planet of the Apes - a battle that wasn't that intense - or interesting.The remaining characters - save one - were generic cannon fodder, devoid of personality or expression - the CGI Ape characters are hidden under emotionless CGI and the Human characters are hidden under emotionless war paint.  I just didn't give a darn about any of them.The one exception is Steve Zahn's motion capture performance as ""Bad Ape"".  Here is a unique looking and sounding character that the Computer artists spent a great deal of time rendering.  His character stands out from the rest and includes HUMOR!  What a welcome relief.As for the CGI in this film, I could tell the filmmakers spent their time ensuring that Caesar and Bad Ape were rendered very well and very realistically - and they were - these characters were outstanding.  But, it looked to me that the filmmakers, then, cut corners elsewhere.  I could ""see the lines"" from time to time, throwing me out of the film and realizing I'm not watching ""real apes"" but a very well drawn, expensive ""cartoon"".  And there was one shot where I said to myself ""that is a cartoon"", it's like the filmmakers put in a tracking, temporary shot (it's a fleeting one) and failed to replace it.Clearly, the filmmakers are setting us up for the remake of the 1968 Charlton Heston classic THE PLANET OF THE APES, for they sprinkle in characters like Cornelius and Nova in this film (and remember, some astronauts went ""missing"" during the first film of this trilogy).  I will faithfully return to the Cineplex to watch that one (I'm a HUGE fan of the original), I just don't think I'll be revisiting this one anytime soon.Bring on Dr. Zaius!Letter Grade:  B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)","

"view_and_review","16 July 2017","If the Planet of the Apes franchise ends with this installment then it will rank as one of the top trilogies all time. Now, that's both: not saying much and saying a lot. It's not saying much because there are only a handful of good trilogies. But it's saying a lot because there are so many abysmal trilogies, so the odds were incredibly against this series being even halfway decent.If Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't establish the apes as intelligent sovereign creatures with no other desire than to be left alone, The War for the Planet of the Apes did. We were given a deeper and longer look inside of their lives as this movie spent more time giving us the apes than the first two.The lead primate, Caesar, finds his community under attack again. He is faced with the choices of flee to a more remote location or take the fight to the humans. It's not an easy choice to be certain because those that they are up against now are trained soldiers.The movie goes far beyond that though. It is a layered story with several portentous moments. Regardless of whether you're an ardent animal hater or merely indifferent to the plight of lesser creatures, this movie will give you pause over the conflict between the apes and the humans.War for the Planet of the Apes is excellent and it only enhances what came before it.","

I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep in the theatre.

"noloxtreme","16 July 2017","The first movie of the year to me that did not live up to the high expectations set by the first two. Dawn of the planet of the apes is still to me the best of the series.As others have also stated, this was not really a ""War"" for the planet. Which is a bit weird, seeing as we've already an impressive battle between humans and apes in Dawn. I was expecting more of that, but on a more epic scale-the final showdown for the planet. On one side, Woody Harrelson's character-a multi layered character. Humanity's greatest and last hope, making one final stand. And on another, Caesar-leading his species in their final fight against humanity for dominance of the planet. I was expecting epic, complex military strategies and battles. But alas, all we got was Caesar's personal quest for revenge and an ape concentration camp. Hell, that would be fine if the apes didn't have to then depend on Deus ex machina, stupidity and coincidence to escape the camp.I honestly don't know what the director was going for with this movie. The title certainly doesn't fit the movie. This movie did not really move the plot forward, other than to try to tie in the original movie where humans could no longer speak. But you can't make an entire movie just on that premise. Anyways. It's a solid trilogy but the last part is the weakest of the series. I just wanted to see Caesar, emulate his namesake Julius Caesar and lead the Apes in battle. We didn't get that.","

"The-Sarkologist","29 July 2017","In a way I'm not all that surprised that they have now released a third film in the reboot series. A part of me was thinking that maybe they are prequels, but when you consider that the original films created a time loop where apes from the future come to the present, and then give birth to a race of sentient apes, the whole prequel idea really doesn't seem to work. Further, it seems to be a movement away from the original remake, which was actually set on another world on the other side of a black hole. It seems, thus, that they have gone back to the drawing board and have have come up with these prequel reboots, for want of a better word.The problem with these series is not so much not seeing the previous films, but having seen them so long ago that one actually forgets what happened. While they do give us a bit of a recap, this film is unfortunately not one that can simply stand alone. Still, considering the fact that it was a full house when I saw it suggests that there is some popularity with the franchise. As for me, I simply saw it because I had seen the previous two, even though there was really no burning desire for me to actually go out and see this sequel.The film starts sometime after the previous film and the apes are being tracked by a militia. During one such even Caeser's wife and son are killed, so he decides to go off and seek vengeance against the killer. However, he also sends all of the other apes off to find a new home, though this doesn't work out all that well as they eventually end up being captured by the humans and put to work as slaves. Caesar also gets captured, and the film simply descends into what is basically a prison break film. Sure, there are a few twists and surprises, but in the end it is basically a film sit in a prison, where the prisoners happen to be apes.Honestly, I have to say that when I sat down to watch this film, other than feeling rather cramped in my seats, I pretty much asked myself why it was that I was actually watching this film. In part it was fun, but in the end it really just seemed to drag that little too much. I guess the whole premise of sentient apes going to war against humans, and the humans slowly dying off in favour of the apes, is something that seems to have been done to death in the past. I really didn't grab my attention, and for most of the time I was just sitting there quite restless. Maybe, just maybe, if videoshops were still around I'd be waiting for these films to come out on video where I don't have to watch it in one sitting, but since I am too stingy for Netflix, and do other things at home as opposed to watching films, I guess seeing movies of this quality is going to be what the future holds.","

"mike_brunton","9 October 2017","There is an alarming trend in Hollywood, think if you throw 150 million dollars at a film, it has to be good! War was the most misleading title I have ever seen. I stopped watching this drek after 1 hour. 1 hour of my life wasted. Knowing incredibly there was still over an hour to go. And for what? The whole Caesar ends up in a concentration camp with his Apes could have been done in 30 minutes and hey presto! The movie could have been 1 and a half hours of more concise story-line. I saw other people saying the writers had copied other films and I agree. The whole Caesar sets out to find the Colonel and kill him picking up 2 sidekicks along the way Lord of the Rings and another thousand movies. By the time I stopped watching, I couldn't care for the Apes or the humans. Caesar especially became more and more annoying. The first part of the movie the attack by Special Forces annoying, after 15 years most of the Apes still carry spears. Despite being able to climb trees easily and post sentries, the humans still crept up on their base. And how were they wiped out, by a sudden storm of hundreds of perfectly arced spears falling into their midst. Looking back most of the movie was boring and annoying, it's a real shame because I enjoyed movies one and two. And as other people have said, how on Earth did this get a rating of 8 out of ten? Even with lovers, this movie doesn't deserve more than a 6 out of ten. Once again, the majority of 100 IQ reviewers misled me into watching drek designed for people of 100 IQ and less. Are humans just Apes?","

"msbreviews","6 August 2017","The third chapter of the Planet of the Apes franchise is finally here! Rise and Dawn are great films, but War needs to end this trilogy perfectly, which is a very rare achievement in the history of cinema (i.e. the third movie of a trilogy to be the best) ... Well, War for the Planet of the Apes does what Return of the King did 14 years ago and it is the best film in this memorable reboot and one of the best (probably THE best) of the year!I can't find a single flaw with this movie. I really thought about every detail and there's only ONE thing that I can see others maybe faulting the film for it, which is some of the second act's pacing. Some new characters are introduced along the way and there is a period of time that some people mind find slow or boring ... For me, that's character development in its glory and it's also a massive build-up to a fulfilling climax in the third act.Don't be fooled by the title nor the trailers, you have to manage your expectations: this is not a war film. This is not an epic battle between humans and apes, which is something that I love about this movie: I didn't watch a single trailer, so I went totally blind into the theater. I assumed that I was going to watch an epic fight just by the beginning of the film, but it plays out in such an unconventional and emotional way that I found myself floored. It's jaw-dropping.Andy Serkis, man ... I don't even know what to say. The team that adds the visual effects to the apes are unbelievably talented ... There are so many close-ups of apes' faces and it's impossible for someone to say ""they're fake"" because they're not! They are so perfect that's impossible for me to look at them and not see a real ape. Andy Serkis deserves a freaking Oscar nomination as well as everyone in the motion capture team. It's unreal the amount of realism that they can pull off.Caesar continues to be the most powerful and emotional character that I've met since God knows how many years ago. He has a roller- coaster journey in terms of his feelings and I could definitely feel it: in his eyes, in his face, in all of his expressions and movements. It's a character that just became unforgettable and fortunately, he has a beautiful story about him and his journey told in three amazing films.Maurice (Karin Konoval) is one of my favorite characters from the trilogy and he gets some well-deserved scenes where he absolutely shines. The new characters are superb: Nova is portrayed by the spectacular Amiah Miller and Steve Zahn plays Bad Ape. She adds an astounding amount of depth to the story without saying a single word and she's able to be so compelling and captivating that when the emotional scenes go down, she elevates them to a whole other level. Bad Ape is where all could have gone wrong since he's the comic relief character in a very profound drama ... It works. Matt Reeves is able to guide this character perfectly, introducing him as a joke in just the right scenes and in just the right amount. One of the things that I faulted the other movies for was that the human characters didn't have that much interest and that I always wanted to be with Caesar. This time, the Colonel is someone that is given a very heartfelt story (even if it's through an exposition scene ... the ONLY one that I can count throughout the whole film), so when the third act begins I actually cared for Harrelson's character.Once again, the visuals are stunning, the film just looks amazing. However, the detail that makes this movie go from great to epic is, as always, its score. Michael Giacchino probably produced his best score to date and it elevated the film in such a powerful way. Most of the runtime, there's no dialogue (either there's sign language or pure silence), so the score had to be perfect in order for the scenes to be more complete ... and it is. I already added it to my Spotify playlist and I can't wait to listen to it over and over again. If some scenes are already emotional enough, this score turns them into something that I couldn't hold my tears from. More than once.The ending is so filled with emotion (I have no idea how many times have I written ""emotion"" or ""emotional"", but it's the perfect word to describe this film) that makes it the best ending to a trilogy that I've seen since The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings). It's such a powerful and fulfilling moment ... Honestly, after some research, I have no problems saying that this is the best reboot EVER done to a franchise since Nolan's The Dark Knight.So ... I think it's pretty obvious ...War for the Planet of the Apes gets my first A+ of 2017! Go watch it! Now! What are you waiting for?!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)","

"cruise01","14 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is an amazing film all around. It does conclude the story arc with Caesar; from the human experiments and extinction to dealing with Kopa's hatred towards humans and going against what he believes that not all humans are bad. It is a satisfying third film that ends on a high emotional note were there is enough development that you care more for the apes than the humans. Director Matt Reeves does not leave out the emotionality on the humans as well. He does build the emotional impact on how the virus has affected them and reshape the rest of the remaining survivors. Even, when the virus has evolved and started to affect the victims from speaking. I feel like Matt Reeves was inspired by a lot of films and biblical themes to help create this plot of Caesars movement on trying to find peace for his family and apes. He is minding his own business with the humans. He is just protecting his kind from harm. Until, Colonel (Woody Harrelson) wants to wipe out all the apes and trying to save civilization. When Caesars apes are captured and forced as slaves. Caesar will do whatever it takes to set his apes free and to find them a peaceful home. The plot was amazing; it does conclude the trilogy well. Also, opening up the movie for more with other stories to tell as characters grow over the time span and become something without giving away spoilers. The film introduces bad ape (Steve Zahn) who mentions that there are other apes out there in the world that evolved like Caesar did and talk like him. It does open up that there other evolved apes like him. And also, the film brings in another human character of a little mute girl (Amiah Miller), who is lost and alone which Caesar and Maurice bring in to their group.The action sequences are breathtaking and the climax battle with the military is exciting and epic. I love the new setting and concept with Caesar and Maurice going after the colonel for his attacks towards their camp. It is an epic journey and Caesars journey as he is becoming a figure of a leader that sets his apes free and knows what is right and wrong. Caesars path towards revenge against the colonel does make him question if his hatred is making him become like Koba. The visual effects are impressive. Every detail and sequence is great. Michael Giacchino music score is beautiful and amazing. Probably one of his best works yet. Woody Harrelson as the villain, it does make him feel like a cliché villain when he walks to an outdoor camp with sunglasses at night but that is not a major issue with the film. There are a lot of great emotional moments with the film as the little girl is trying to help Caesar when he is starved and captured to some breathtaking action sequences. Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes is a great amazing film. It ties the trilogy up well in a high emotional note. The visual effects and the performances are great. The action sequences are exciting. The plot is epic with Caesar and his journey to saving his apes. I definitely recommend to see the film if you seen the others or not.","

"pg-tsinc","31 July 2017","The best of the New trilogy was 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)' which I give 8.5 and I saw it a few times with pleasure. The second one: 'Dawn of the Planet... (2014)' was awful 1.0, as most of the remakes are. They put you in front of a 'fait accompli' when it would have been interesting to 'see' how the apes got in control of the earth (not only the hint about the ape flu). The last one, 'War for the Planet of the Apes (2017' is film in a wardrobe. It contains some elements that should have been develop in the second film. The 'teaser' misleads you about the action, in fact it's a long boring film, with 'cheap close up scenes' that you will have to endure. I give it a 2.0","

"bradenlculver","17 November 2020","The final installment in the reimagined series is storytelling at it's best and on an epic level. The film gets very dark and at times hopeless but is rewardingly satisfying at the other end. The depth and emotion that this film had is something that I feel is missing from other ""blockbuster"" movies and used CGI main characters at that. Long story short, no matter how hard I try I can find nothing wrong with the movie. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" tops the charts in every category","

"feyipuk","13 June 2018","After building up Caesar and the other apes in the first two films, this third one seems so contrived - especially the last twenty minutes - it almost ruins what is otherwise an interesting film. 
Here, the super smart chimpanzee, his family and all the other primates that supported him on the last movie are up against an American Colonel (Woody Harrelson), his assortment of monkey hating soldiers - so not much change to the previous films - and also ""Donkeys""; apes who support the humans. All have complicated relationships which the film could have developed further, rather than the cliched ending that went from action to completion faster than a monkey up a tree.Obviously, the special effects are amazing. The interaction between human and ape are pretty flawless. Nova (Amiah Miller) may get shoe horned into the film, but the way she is able to interact with Maurice (Karin Konoval) is pretty impressive. And watching Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) careen around with his extremely expressive is a comic interlude from all the serious activities going on on the screen.For the most part, the film was alright. Right up until after the Colonel has probably the longest spoken scene in the film (which isn't hard when you know only one ape can talk, though all the apes can understand English), it moved at a good pace. It just seemed like the producers then felt they needed to wrap it up in a nice, complete manner, which maybe wasn't needed.","

"Vivekmaru45","20 October 2017","This is the sequel to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), and follows events from the previous film.The theme of the film is liberation. If you think about it, the story is so common with The Ten Commandments directed by Cecil B. DeMille. So in this film, the chimpanzee Caesar plays the role that Moses played.Also, a thing you must ask yourself, is why they chose to name the chimpanzee Caesar. Caesar is actually derived from Julius Caesar who was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.He was later brutally assassinated. I recommend you to watch Julius Caesar (1970 film) which I think is the best adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, but I warn you the assassination scene depicted in the film is very graphic and disturbing. Back to this film: Two years after the U.S. military was called to fight off an increasingly intelligent and dangerous tribe of apes, starting a devastating war between the two species, the apes' clan, led by the chimpanzee Caesar, are attacked in the woods by a rogue paramilitary faction known as Alpha-Omega, led by a mysterious Colonel. Alpha-Omega has in its service apes (called ""donkeys"") that had previously followed Koba, a maniacal, human-hating bonobo who led a failed coup against Caesar and started the war after leading a vengeful attack against human survivors in San Francisco.Verdict: the theme of the film as I have mentioned earlier is liberation. Caesar's character suffers a lot from persecution, by both his own kind and humans. Woody Harrelson gives the same performance Marlon Brando did in Apocalypse Now(1979). Similarly, Harrelson's character is the same as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. I was not impressed by the direction, script, photography and background sound-effects. Since this film deals largely with CGI graphics, the human casting seems irrelevant to discuss. Woody Harrelson is the only good actor who has gained fame with films like: Indecent Proposal(1993), Natural Born Killers(1994), Money Train(1995), The People vs. Larry Flynt(1996), Play It to the Bone(1999) and No Country for Old Men(2007).I was not impressed with Matt Reeves direction. He has made a film even worse than his earlier one. His best film for me remains Let Me In(2010), an American-British adaptation of the of the Swedish film Let the Right One In(2008).","

"eric262003","25 September 2018","The last of the the series of ""The Planet of the Apes"" titled ""The War of the Planet of the Apes"" sparked an abundance of positive reviews from the audience. The box office reached the plateau of over $134 million and people were just stunned at the outcome of how the series ended. To me this final installment was the best of the series and if a film wants to wrap up a series this is truly the way to do it.It's great to see Matt Reeves back again in the director's chair plus he has double the duty this time serving as co-writer along with Mike Bomback. It's great that Reeves returns that way we can easily have the series pick up where it left off from the previous installment, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"". In this movie we see the return of Caesar (Andy Serkis) getting his vengeance against the ruthless Colonel (Woody Harrelson) after the pain and heartbreak he caused to his family.Although the plot seems like a story that's been done hundreds of times, Reeves succeeds in taking the efforts to create newer, fresher ideas and avoiding using recycled cliches like other filmmakers do. The epic battle between Caesar and the Colonel has increased in levels of sheer intensity is likely to grab your attention. It's also a great way to side with the simians and truly has characters you could easily side with while having villains you could easily despise.Woody Harrelson is excellent as the villain in this story. From the opening scenes you truly hate this person and you hope that in the end he gets what's coming at him. Harrelson is amazingly versatile in all of his performances, but here he does outdo himself here. Don't expect to see any signs of his likable character on 'Cheers"" anytime.Great addition to the cast is Amiah Miller as the mute girl, Nova (similar traits her predecessor Linda Harrison portrayed in the ""Planet of the Apes"" film in the 1960's and 1970's). She's been caught with the simian epidemic making her almost primitive, but her expression and emotions truly make up for role in which she is mute throughout the whole film. Even though comedy is not a necessity in this movie, it does have some comic relief from Steve Zahn's performance as Bad Ape. At least it feels organic and not rubbed into our faces. It also helps that his backstory is quite provocative to make his character all the more likable.The story and the CGI are truly the cornerstones that make the franchise all the more enjoyable. And with the apes who are talking the CGI is in full swing making it all the more effective in its storytelling. Sure I'm more for practical stuff, but the CGI was used wisely and never catches you off guard. And sure their voices are not as on the levels as the human race or have the same types of weaponry as humans, but the film is so effective in its storytelling, you just forget that these simians are CGI. The special effects deserves award recognition come award season.And though the film can brag that the positives outweigh the negatives, there are still plenty of errors too as well. One of the guffaws includes the apes scoping the hideouts of the Colonel. Caesar is observing his nemesis through his binoculars. Luca (Terry Notary) Caesar's reliable ally. Luca asks in him in sign language if he sees the Colonel, but Caesar responds to him even though he isn't looking at Luca. There's others, but they don't hinder the movie that much.To say that this film ends the trilogy with a bang would be an understatement. But if they wish to make more films of this calibre 20th Century Fox can now take the liberties to create more stories along this route. With characters like Nova and Cornelius added to the franchise, this is the opening of potential prequels to the films that were made in the 1960's and 1970's. And though it is predictable, it still quenches your curiosity as to what will happen next. Of course this solidifies the trust we have in Matt Reeves as he'll be directing the next Batman film. Reeves did a great job in the last two films of this franchise as we look forward to his future projects.","

In the first part we watched Caesar learns how to interact with people, then he hardly could be able to say NO when he was mad, the next part he was able to speak, hardly, and we accepted it, now you're telling me that he can speak frequently as a native speaker while he's away of people and no teacher or he doesn't even listen to anyone to catch some new words up? And what about that one ape they found who can speak very well just by listening to humans? If it's that easy, I should've been born in a world of talking apes!It's a good movie overall, it's just not as good as the other parts. That's it.","

The SFX is impressive and makes the film watchable but by a thin margin. Technically and logically there is so much wrong with this movie to the point of being ridiculous. Based on the ending, we assume that will be the last Planet of the Apes movie. If this one was the best they can do then it will not be a bad thing. Will we be watching it again, highly unlikely.","

"jmcternan-91574","28 July 2017","Oh I tried to ignore the propaganda, I really did, the first two films of this trilogy are very good films (and not in a back handed ""for a summer blockbuster"" sort of compliment), but this is an awful 150 million misstep. This is my 2nd review ever and I don't review things unless they particularly rub me the wrong way.I'll be spelling certain words wrong to get around word gagging orders on IMDb.War of the Planet of the Apes literally beats you over the head with this defecation of the human spirit, I'm in awe of how blatantly forward it is and I love good sci-fi commentary. (Battlestar Galactica and The Wire are some of my favorite pieces of fiction)Here in this script we have no sympathy for Harrelson's and humanity's understandable dilemma as to how to beat a virus that is causing humans to lose their speech and higher faculties. They don't even have the balls to have the apes wipe out what's left of the human army as that would make the apes even more obviously terrible than they already are; so they have a natural disaster do the job. The blond girl/child that they carry with them goes to live with the apes, dumb(from the virus) but happy.......and humanity's downfall is complete. Even though exalt the child's beauty early in the film! But what is beauty without brains ultimately?What great moral lesson was I supposed to glean? That humans are so terrible that we should walk quietly into the night? Oh look the apes are thick.....but some of them are funny Totally worth it!Conversations and plot points are so monosyllabic that it was almost orgasmic when Woody Harrelson turned up to speak more than than the few grunts that we hear up to this point and FINALLY gives us a reason to care.Bonus points for cultural maxisms (spelled wrong to get around censorship) is when the blond child cries over the ape who is killed that she has known for all of two scenes but doesn't even flinch when her father is killed by said group of apes.Go out to the beach with your kids, hell even go the beach or lake by yourself, hell go further, go out when its raining and make some memories.Also I'm not the slightest bit Christian and I can see this picture is blatantly not only anti-Christian but to the non religious out there as well its this......anti human, anti intelligence","

"BA_Harrison","24 February 2020","War for the Planet of the Apes. Sounds epic, doesn't it? Humans and chimps locked in mortal combat for the supremacy of the planet. Which makes it all the more of a let-down that the majority of this third movie in the rebooted franchise doesn't feature any such action. Most of the film follows chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis) as he makes his way to a human military base where he hopes to take revenge on The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), the man who killed his wife and child.Along the way, Caesar encounters both human and apes, some of whom join him on his travels (including a comedy relief chimp called Bad Ape, and a young mute girl called Nova, a nod towards Linda Harrison's character in the original The Planet of the Apes movie). When Caesar is captured and taken to be tortured in the Colonel's ape work-camp, these new friends help him to escape. Of the 140 minute run-time, only the final 20 minutes or so contain any scenes that could be described as 'war', as a human battalion attacks The Colonel's stronghold; the apes are caught in the crossfire as they try to flee.Judging by the film's current IMDb rating of 7.4, Caesar's emotional journey seems to have satisfied many viewers. Me? I longed for hordes of angry apes on horseback firing machine guns (the best thing about the previous movie), but I was left wanting, my disappointment compounded by the fact that the digital effects for this third film have finally come close to convincing me that the apes are real (the CGI has really improved since 2011) and an all-out inter-species battle could have been something truly spectacular. Oh well, maybe next time.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb (although I very nearly rounded my rating down because -- and you can call me picky, if you like -- I refuse to believe that a horse could support the weight of a fully grown gorilla).","

"MoviesorSleep","29 July 2017","The great question sci-fi films pose (and I do believe these movies can be categorized as sci-fi) is: ""What does it mean to be human""? ""What separates us from other creatures?"" Woody Harrelson's character put it best in repeatedly saying, ""So emotional!"" to a chained Caesar for it is precisely that -- our capacity for emotion: compassion, empathy, and mutual understanding for the other is what is said to make us human. Colonel: ""There are times when it is necessary to abandon our humanity to save humanity"" Think of the other two films, it spends the majority of the time convincing the audience that apes are not savages and instead quite rational due to their increased intelligence, and therefore, emotional intelligence. They are able to form communities with families and friends developing trust, love, and the such. But it doesn't stop there, Caesar proves himself, repeatedly, to apes and humans that ""ape"" does not automatically equal savage. (Insert obvious Koba internal struggle here). This is proved in the first couple minutes of the film, where he spares the lives of soldiers, and later on where Caesar is suffering from a sort of PTSD from Koba's death. The film spends quite a bit of time on reactions mixed in with moments of silence. It is contrasted quite well with the dramatic music and epic battle scenes. The title may have mislead people since many assume with the word ""war"" in the title, the movie would have tons of ape vs. human fighting, but it cannot be reduced to that. Dialogue, mostly through (hand)signing amplified the serious and silent nature of suffering and uncertainty in war. It is powerful. Silence makes the audience pay closer attention to the precise facial expressions of the apes. Expressions of uncertainty in planning the next move, suffering in the cages many once lived in, and despair in light of losing a loved one. The moments of silence, the quiet, heart-wrenching moments as the camera zooms closer and closer to the individual's face, further humanizes the subject. Think of the moment when Caesar realizes the Colonel murdered his wife and eldest son, the score slows, the camera shows Caesar's tears and clenched jaw with exposed teeth. It cuts to Colonel's face in a rough, make-up camouflage. The Colonel thought he was killing Caesar. Who is shown as the savage here? I do not think the film can be reduced to humans = bad and now apes = good. Times of war operate in gray zones, and in film, it is the audience's ultimate decision in what is deemed as a moral act. Because we can't blame the Colonel for trying to save his people. We also can't blame Caesar for trying to save his community. But at what cost? If we abandon our morality, what are we but a creature? So the question is ultimately: What is Ape/What is Human Needless to say, it is a film worth thinking of a bit deeper, regardless of your perception of its political motive and religious and historical commentary, albeit, it does exist. It is beautifully shot, well acted (go Andy Serkis!), and a terrific conclusion to the Planet of the Apes reboot, prequel, and trilogy.","

"movie-reviews-uk","29 November 2022","On its own terms ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a good action movie but it's not a great film. The narrative is just too illogical and there are too many plot holes for that to be the case. What really saves it are the preceding two chapters in the story arc and the depth that they add to the characters.At the heart of the story sits Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his journey from newborn to weary warrior. There's a real sense that he never wanted to be the leader except that destiny spoke and he was the only one to answer. So he keeps up the struggle for his ape brothers while still wishing and hoping for a peaceful resolution.It's not to be though and this third installment draws heavily on other war movies (such as Apocalypse Now), concentration camp memes and even the Bible as sources. This makes it all rather bombastic but does provide for some genuinely exciting action sequences.Sadly the human characters in the film are as one-dimensional as ever so it's down to the apes to generate an emotional connection. Thanks to the wondrous CGI they still manage to do this although I think that the previous films had the edge on this front. Still I felt for Caesar and his friends as they struggled on against the malign influence of Man.Now if you're new to the franchise then it would be perverse to watch this film in isolation. It's just not that good in its own right. But as the finale to the rebooted trilogy it's fine and indispensable if you want to see how it connects to the later events seen in the pre-2001 films.","

"keelhaul-80856","22 November 2017","I generally love these films, from the old to new. This one is very high-budget, A-list film-making, but the title is stupid.I was expecting an awesome Braveheart-style throwdown, with several epic battles, in a campaign to decide the fate of Earth, with some intriguing political or betrayal or love-story subplots.The film should be called ""Ape Escape: Part 2"". Woody Allen, I mean Harrelson, turns in an honorable performance as the vengeful, cold colonel, and Caesar is always good. However, the film misled most moviegoers with the title. The movie is not really about the war campaign between apes and humans, but more about social messages, and rehashes the same exact storyline from many other ape films, including the original reboot to this trilogy. The film is well-shot, and looks beautiful. The trailers have an epic feel, but this doesn't really play out until the end of the movie. I feel SO MUCH MORE could have been done with this movie, but was built around a sorrowful worker escape plot, instead of a bad ass battle royal with political intrigue and a better script. This was kind of boring, aside from the great effects, and the few great moments between Caesar and Woody Harrelson. I am usually very much into these films, but this one had all of us like, ""meh"". It was going through the motions, with a huge budget, but I was very disappointed with such high expectations.","

"richardchatten","11 December 2022","Pierre Boule who wrote the original 1963 novel doesn't even get a mention in the credits. The scintilla of wit on display in the opening sequence of troops going into battle with 'Monkey Killer' and 'Bedtime for Bonzo' on their helmets is never thereafter repeated.The combat sequences look like a grotesque parody of the Vietnam War and as usual it takes itself very seriously and goes on forever. Nevertheless the money's all up there on the screen and the majestic peaks of snowbound British Columbia provide an impressive backdrop.The film desperately misses Jerry Goldsmith's score for the original, but Amiah Miller is a cute little tyke and the scene where her guardian hands her a spring of pink blossom is genuinely touching. The actual makeup has come on by leaps and bounds enabling Woody Harrelson to take off his shades and declare ""My God! Look at your eyes... almost human!""","

"jacobs-greenwood","19 July 2017","The original Planet of the Apes (1968) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) were the first sci-fi films that I can remember watching, having been born in 1960, and I preferred the former to the latter. I went on to see the sequel(s) for each, which is probably the reason that the Planet of the Apes remains a fond memory of my past; I even sought and watched every episode of its short-lived TV series. I saw Tim Burton's reboot and have seen the newest trilogy that culminated in this one.So it is with this backdrop that I can say that this is the best of the other films, save the original; the original has to be the best because it gave us the initial concept. This latest trilogy is faithful to that vision and is so multi-faceted, giving us much of what was lost in the films and series in between, by restoring the ""connection"" between man and the apes that was originally conceived and exhibited between Taylor (Charlton Heston) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) & Zira (Kim Hunter).Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) started by (re)establishing a strong (loving) relationship between man (James Franco's character) and ape, Caesar was the first chimpanzee that learns to speak. It gives a plausible reason for the development of his intellect, its spread among many other great apes (chimps, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans), and the resulting virus that proves deadly to man.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) reveals a remnant of virus- immune humans and their battle with the Caesar-led apes. Jason Clarke plays the human that 'connects' with Caesar, but this is the weakest of the three newer films. It's necessary because it affirms the distrust and strife between the species and establishes through Koba, a bonobo who'd been abused by man, that apes can be just as evil as man.In much the same way that Rogue One (2016) is for Star Wars (1977), War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) serves as a bridge to Planet of the Apes (1968), introducing characters and story lines that were realized in the original. Not an easy task for such a franchise. We meet Nova (Heston's squeeze) as a child, and learn why she couldn't speak, Cornelius (Roddy McDowell's character), and the orangutan that becomes the lawgiver, Maurice (a nod to the actor from the original).While there is plenty of war action in this one, what impressed this reviewer most was the humanity exhibited, by both man and (surprisingly) ape. Despite all the killing and violence between the two groups, there are tender - really beautiful - moments, even between those with the most animosity towards each other: Caesar and The Colonel, played by the ubiquitous Woody Harrelson. It's really quite well done, especially the character development, and highly recommended, especially for those with nostalgia for the first installment of the franchise.","

"D-Defoe","13 July 2017","What I do not like about this movie is the basic message: Humans in comparison to animals cannot be trusted, they show no mercy, the animals reach the higher ethical ground and should survive and reign the world.How is the goal of this message achieved? First, the whole movie plot is filmed from the perspective of the ape- society, their families, their friends, their love and their sorrows. Unlike the perfectly arranged classical Charleton Heston movies in the 60s which bore a shock element in a dark post-nuclear, post-apocalyptic world, where mankind destroyed itself, this movie aims at showing the worthlessness of human beings. The little blonde girl whose father got shot dead by Cesar, didn't loose a single teardrop for her father, but after a short while befriends herself with the apes, starts crying for a dead gorilla, who gave her a flower, gives water and food to the imprisoned killer of her father, Cesar, and feels herself quite comfortable now growing up as a monkey daughter in the sense of a Tarzan, yet in a considerable lower social position. Second, other humans, except maybe for Woody Harrelson as a pittiful leader of a small company, do not have character depth in this movie, and are basically the enemies, and except for the little blonde girl, they all die, either killed by monkeys, by themselves, or by a snow avalanche.What a stupid movie! What a stupid message! Worthliness of human beings is being shown here. Of course the human is bad from nature (described as sinner), as the Bible tells us, but he is not worthless, and as Gods creation is above the animals. Here you see the perversion of this idea to the extent.Now to the ambiance: Cold, snowy, Alaska-like landscape, no cities, no larger Human or animal dwelling places. Most of the time 5 apes and the little blonde girl take the central part in the non-inhabited boreal wilderness on seek of revenge.The fights: starting with a tactical nonsense Human uphill assault with well equipped tactical weapons against spears and still being lost. Only 3 humans and a silver-backed Gorilla get captivated, and after a short interrogation get released by Cesar, but later become his fiercest enemies again. Major explosions quite in the end of this almost two hours movie. I spare to pinpoint the many flaws of the fights there, just dumb.Better title in this case would be: ""War for the little ape reserve in the Northern Alaska (or whatever landscape it represented)""Cesar's portrayal - in the beginning: the good leader - in the middle: the bad revenge seeker - at last: and the ugly Spartacus in the workingcamp Conclusion of the movie: all humans dead (except girlie who feels herself as a monkey) and the long exodus to sunny monkey land next to a big evening-sun-bathed lake, where they all lived happily there after,...oh no, not all, Cesar finally died from his arrow wound, which he survived for the 1000 km trek through the deserts of death Valley (or whatever location it represented), with a last glimpse of his little monkey-boy playing with the little blonde human girl, he died right in the arms of his Orang-Utan friend Murksy, Mopsy...forgot the name.

"perval","19 August 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is very close to be a masterpiece.The movie exceeded my expectations and is even better than the previous movie in the trilogy which was incredibly good.This film is the definition of epic!The film has a very dark tone that is similar to The Dark Knight trilogy( I don't say it steals from it I just say it has a similar tone).War for the Planet of the Apes has great effects,a beautiful score by Micheal Giacchino,an interesting,character driven story with complex,three dimensional characters and some incredible performances.The characters as I mentioned are complex and developed(mostly Caesar and the antagonist the Colonel).Almost all of the characters in the film are dark and serious except one ape who serves as the comic relief in the film.His character was a risk because normally in such a dark movie a character like this would feel forced but he was lovable and was a nice addition to the overall film.Caesar's character was incredible,well developed and his decisions had impact to the story.The antagonist was also very interesting and his actions were justified by his backstory.The acting in the film was amazing.The motion captured performances by the supporting cast were very good.As I mentioned the performance of Woody Harrelson was unbelievable and the best performance in the film was Andy Serkis as Caesar.His motion capture performance was incredible and it was Oscar worthy.In a Nutshell War of the Planet of the Apes is near perfect with breathtaking visuals,great music,mind blowing performances and a character driven story with complex,three dimensional characters","

The other two in the series are way better than this one. This movie was a bore! The planet of the apes with Mark Wahlberg was better than this one. I don't see how the script was even approved for this movie. The only positive was the CGI and that was wasted money since this movie sucked.","

"phoenixinvictus","7 October 2017","Nobody likes to watch the hero die, but I could not think of a more dignified way for a leader and warrior to die. I believe that the negative reviews are due to expecting an apocalyptic battle between humans and apes where in this glorious showdown one species would prevail. We see a battle-weary Ceasar who is tired of bloodshed and is still dealing with the repercussion of Korda's treachery. There are some disturbing allegories that this movie reveals in some parts like the African slave trade, the World War II Holocaust and the Native American Trail of Tears. There is a lot of suffering and hardships to overcome in order to survive.There were two things which bothered me in this movie. One was how humans are portrayed in the film, they are either evil or have major character flaws, while the apes are just victims trying to survive persecution; the other was the ""virus"" mutating and devolving humans to a more primitive state, which to me was too unbelievable to accept.","

"johnplocar","3 January 2018","I'm a pretty big fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films. I love the first one, my favorite is ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", and the recent reboot series comes along and I've been trying to love them as much as everyone else does, but I can't seem to bring myself there. I liked ""Rise"" just fine. It has a decent character driven story with a likable main cast, but suffers from pretty poor looking special effects and blatantly abuses CGI; while also having some pretty standout bad moments shoved in at inappropriate times. Overall a fine film. Then ""Dawn"" comes along and it improves in some aspects, but takes some major missteps in others. It is a fantastically made film, the character of Caesar and most of the apes are phenomenally well done, the effects were great and the story was very solid. Problems mainly resided 100% in all of the human characters whether they were hollow 2-dimensional shells with no personality nor charisma whatsoever or they were complete idiots only there to further the plot with their stupidity which was annoying and not believable in the slightest. Again, overall a fine film. Now ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" comes in and holy moly this is a great movie. Legitimately a great film. It is everything I have wanted out of this reboot series and more. It's dark, one of the bleakest films to come out of 2017 for sure but also has plenty of levity to it as well. It has humanity and personality and style throughout its entirety. All of the characters are interesting and 3-dimensional beings. The villain, played by Woody Harrelson, is terrifying and Andy Serkis as Ceasar is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest heroes ever portrayed on the big screen. Ceasar's character arc is one of best I've seen in a movie series and it comes to a true glorious end here.The cinematography is gorgeous with its feel of an old school epic, the story is enthralling and beautifully poetic, tonally pitch perfect, and the action as well as every plot point feels monumental. Easily one of the best films of the year.","

"nickrissmeyer","13 August 2017","War for The Planet of The Apes blows the first two films of the trilogy out of the water by a long shot. This film was a huge surprise for me. I was expecting an okay, fun to watch blockbuster action movie with Apes and people just shooting each other for 2 hours. The film blew me away. This is by far one of the best Hollywood block buster movies I've seen in recent memory. It is jam packed with heart and emotion and is a literal emotional roller-coaster start to finish. The film touches on themes of slavery and the divide of species and draws parallels with lots of current social issues. The motion capture acting is incredible and the character models are so lifelike now that you forgot they aren't actual apes. Andy Serkis is incredible along with the other motion capture actors. Woody Harrelson's character was the weakest by far but he still feels rooted in the story and the universe of the planet of the apes.I can't even begin to understand all the terrible reviews this movie is getting on IMDb. Anyone who didn't like this has unfortunately been poisoned by the modern block buster explosions and no substance virus that has been running rampant for years. This movie is full of heart and a genuine respect for this franchise and it's characters and story. There's nothing about this movie that was not meticulously crafted.","

I would have slept through it if I wasn't so irritated by the music. I've always been on the fence about whether Michael Giacchino is a good composer or not, but this settles it for me. He sucks. And Matt Reeves should give up directing and somebody needs to break his hands before he attempts to write anything ever again. A movie so bad it ruins the rest of the franchise. Even Charlton Heston is spinning in his grave.","

But the story itself, although very well-written, didn't excite me. The essence is touching and tragic in its truthfulness, but in my opinion, it is not presented in a sufficiently impressive way. Woody Harrelson masterfully played the role of the main ""villain"" and made me hate him with my whole being, despite the fact that he is one of my favorite actors.8/10","

"Troy_Campbell","29 July 2017","A trilogy-closer for the modern Planet of the Apes outings, we reunite with ape leader Caesar (a motion captured Andy Serkis) as he seeks to locate a safe haven for his clan whilst avoiding war with the humans. Trouble is, after the high-casualty conflict caused by Caesar's troubled right-hand ape Koba (Toby Kebbell – back here in dream sequences only) in the previous film, a battalion of men led by Woody Harreslon's ruthless Colonel are out for blood. Opening with two gripping battles—the first loud, intense and full of explosions; the second a suspenseful sneak attack with brutal results—the action stakes are set high and the narrative tempo is set fast. So much so the remainder of the movie struggles to maintain either. Screenwriters Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves continue the series' bleak theme of how narrow-mindedness causes self-destruction, the uncompromising sombreness and occasional over-sentimentality tolerable due to the immense intelligence and maturity imbued in the story. Reeves, who also directs, furthers this world primarily through character development, Caesar again proving to be one of the most complex and engaging protagonists in blockbusters today; his potency as a revered leader coming from the sacrifice and emotional turmoil he endures to protect his kind. Caesar's ability to captivate comes courtesy of a joint effort, with Serkis' passionate and tormented performance captured and enhanced by the visual effects team who then produce beautiful and flawless photorealistic CGI. There are also relatively minor moments littered throughout that have a lasting effect: meeting Steve Zahn's lonely and slightly crazy simian Bad Ape, Caesar's rage at the torture dished out to a slave ape, and mute girl Nova (Amiah Miller) quietly entering a prison to feed the hungry. It may not stick the landing due to a finale that strangely restrains Harrelson's villain, but it's easily forgiven thanks to the goodwill built by the franchise through crediting its audience as grown-ups who can engage with the weighty and intellectual themes on offer. Arguably the greatest trilogy since Nolan's Batman films, WFTPOTA provides this rebooted series with an appropriately epic, affecting and contemplative closing chapter.","

"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","15 July 2017","What has fascinated me about this trilogy is how it explores the idea of humanity through the eyes of an animal learning to become human. Each film has its lead Caesar overcoming a certain emotional obstacle and in this final chapter we see him go up against his greatest one yet: himself.When we enter War, we feel that the world has gotten bleaker since the end of Dawn. The humans of compassion and fairness like Will and Malcolm from the previous films no longer exist. The last of human society are now just military fanatics who see that the apes must either be wiped out or enslaved to ensure their own survival. Like past Ape films, War can be seen as a dark reflection of upon our own society from enslaved and abused apes resembling Holocaust victims to the Colonel drawing inspiration from real power-hunger fanatical leaders like Hitler to Trump whom lead a legion of blind, faithful followers. Despite its title, War is actually less focused on explosive battles but more on the internal battle within ourselves, whether you're an ape or human. Director Matt Reeves shows how war can dehumanize the compassionate by examining Caesar's emotional arc through the story. After a tragic incident, we see Caesar change from being the merciful leader we know him as to an individual on a path of revenge who begins distancing himself from his loved ones and his own humanity. We question if he can return to being the ape he once was to lead his people or end up destroying himself like his former ally Koba. In contrast, the human villain the Colonel is someone who has allowed the war to strip away all of his humanity, compassion and mercy to ensure that Caesar's race won't subjugate his own by whatever means necessary. As the story progresses, we even see that both sides end up turning on themselves out of desperation and fear.While War is the darkest of trilogy, it does offer some lightness to the bleak tone. The characters like Maurice the orangutan and the mute human child Nova offer an emotional anchor that keeps Caesar from losing his humanity all at once. Maurice acts as Caesar's conscious to ensure he won't end up hurting himself and anyone else unnecessarily. Nova shows to be the only human that has actual humanity thanks to her innocence and bond with Maurice. And a big surprise is Steve Zahn's new character Bad Ape who doesn't just to exist to be a joke in the film but offers necessary levity and proves to be very instrumental in the journey of the apes.Regardless if Andy Serkis finally gets that Oscar nomination next year for his mo-cap role as Caesar, he has still proved he is one of the greatest actors working today. Serkis does not need words to show you the mental state of Caesar. You see that in his final role as Caesar he gives the best performance of his career as he puts every thought and care into how Caesar expresses himself including dark aspects you have never before seen. And the dynamic between him and Woody Harrelson as the Colonel offers some of the best scenes in the film. While he may seem like the film's version of Colonel Kurts from Apocalypse Now at first, Harrelson goes beyond what you expect of him as a usual villain and shows a layer of complexity and emotion that is beyond what I expected. In Dawn, Matt Reeves stepped in to take over what Rupert Wyatt started with. Here he shows more creative control in this then in Dawn (which is nothing against it). As I said before, Reeves is more much invested in character's motivations and decisions then action but that doesn't stop from him making it look rough and gritty. And he lets the visuals and character's emotions guide the story instead of dialogue exposition. Moments with no music let you feel the emotion and sense of isolation that surrounds the characters. And the music by the way is probably the best of Michael Gianchino's work that I have heard yet.And what can I say about the visuals. WETA has now made me completely forget I am watching a cgi character. The way the apes's skin and fur reflects and absorbs light and the snow dripping from their faces definitely says War will be winning a lot of visual effects awards in the near future. Aside from stunning cgi, other visuals that should be taken notice are the cinematography shots from Michael Seresin. As Caesar's group travel across the post-apocalyptic wilderness, the shots of the haunting but yet stunning and beautiful landscapes show how bleak the world is. And we feel how menacing the forces of nature really are.War for the Planet of the Apes may not only be the best entry in one of the best trilogies ever made but may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found such a difficult time finding a flaw in this film. It brings Caesar's journey to ensure his people's place as the next rulers of the planet to a fitting and emotional close with lots of tears being shed. War for the Planet of the Apes is hands down a masterpiece.","

"billcr12","26 October 2017","Woody Harrelson is the Colonel, and he channels Brando's Kurtz from Apocalypse Now,as he has gone off the deep end. After killing Caesar' wife and son, the lead ape is on a mission to settle the score, much like an old Clint Eastwood spaghetti western. Again, as with the previous ape film from 2014, it is much too long at two hours and twenty minutes. Does anyone know the meaning of the word editing? Otherwise, it is the classic battle of good versus evil between Caesar and the colonel. Woody is great, as usual, and Andy Serkis reprises his role from the last Ape movie, and he again equal to the task. The visuals are stunning, and the action non stop. Other than the aforementioned length of the film, if you have some time to kill this is one entertaining ape fest.","

"capone666","17 October 2017","War for the Planet of the ApesIn a society run by apes you can rest assured only evolution will be taught in school.Still, there are a few humans in this sci-fi/fantasy that favour a creationist curriculum.When a human militia led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) murders his family, the genetically enhanced simian Caesar (Andy Serkis) takes a troop of monkeys (Steve Zahn, Karin Konoval) with him on a mission of revenge.But Caesar's vengeance takes a backseat when he must liberate hundreds of his brethren from The Colonel's primate concentration camp before they are eradicated.While this heady conclusion to the reimagined Planet of the Apes franchise wears its historical influences on its sleeve, those inspirations make for a dark final act. Nevertheless, the smidgen of action, the endless nods to the original series and the CGI are definitely highpoints.Furthermore, with monkeys in charge you can rest assured bananas will never become extinct.

It would have been a much shorter movie if they decided just to get along. The movie is too long and there're are just too many battle scenes. Then it becomes a slave issue movie, a prison camp escape movie, and even a ""Heart of Darkness"" rogue military officer rip off.Going in you know what to expect and if you went in you can figure out who won. Technically the movie looks great. It should be seen in a theater with a big screen and strong sound. Without disclosing the ending, they will find a way to bring Caesar back.","

"darkreignn","9 January 2018","Oh my God, what a movie. This is no doubt one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie I have seen in 2017. In my quest to review every ""Star Wars"" movie, I decided the next logical thing to do was to watch ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" and I'm so happy I did.Advertised as a straight-up action flick, ""War"" is anything but. Yes, it opens with an amazingly directed action sequence where a group of human military combatants attack an ape base that is located in the deep words, but that is pretty much the only ""big"" action sequence until the very end of the film, and even then the action is more of a way to further the story rather than something thrown in there for the audience to marvel at and enjoy. Because of this, I can see why the user reviews for this film on IMDB are absolutely atrocious; 1/10 star reviews plague this movie, with a ton of people saying that this movie is ""insufferable,"" ""boring,"" ""nonsense,"" and ""one of the worst films I've seen in the cinema!"". The reviews among the general audience have been mixed, to say the least. People have said that this movie does not contain a war, that there is little action, and that the previous film had more of a war than this film did. My own cousin even said, ""that movie is not that good, it's actually pretty boring; they should've called it 'one battle for one small piece of the planet of the apes.'"" I would wholeheartedly disagree with every single criticism that has been thrust upon this movie.For one thing, this movie is a WAR in every sense. If the humans succeed in their goal of eradicating the apes, then the planet will once again belong to them. However, if the apes succeed in their goal of surviving and stopping the violence that the humans seem all too eager to engage in, then they will be able to survive and live in peace without worry of being slaughtered. Sure, there may not be set-piece after set-piece of violent combat, but there doesn't need to be; from the opening scene, the stakes are made explicitly clear as the humans trek through the woods with ""monkey killer"" written on their helmets.And when it comes to the killing, all of the action in this movie is filmed beautifully, artfully. The opening battle sequence left my jaw on the floor with its mixture of aerial and wide shots; everything was shown clearly, without any form of shaky camera. There is no doubt that the action in this movie is amazing, but just because this movie is not constant action from beginning to end doesn't mean that this movie isn't riveting from start to finish. I legitimately don't understand how, after watching the first 20 minutes of this movie, one would not be 100% engaged in the goings on of the film's world. Seeing Caesar's motivation for wanting to track down Woody Harrelson's character is truly heartbreaking and you can't help but root for Caesar to obtain his goal, but at the same time you do see where Woody Harrelson's character is coming from as a colonel.The acting and the CGI are of course, as with the previous 2 films, top notch. Woody Harrelson and Andy Serkis do an incredible job and both give emotional performances. Surprisingly, Amiah Miller also gives a subtle and sweet performance as a child who has lost the ability to speak. Everyone in this movie, whether they be ape or human, does a very good job and the CGI is so lifelike that you will honestly forget that you're not watching animals. I literally don't have a single bad thing to say about this movie, and because of that I am not sure why I am not giving this film a perfect score of 10/10. I adored this movie with all my heart, but I base my ratings out of my gut feelings, and my gut told me to score this film a 9/10, so that is my final rating. If I had to give a reason, I would say that this movie is not as good as the first two films of the trilogy, but it is no doubt a strong sendoff that I will always remember fondly, much like how I remember the first two movies fondly. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an emotionally resonant film and a fantastic ending to one of the best movie trilogies of all time. The clear and slick directing will captivate you as soon as the film starts, and Caesar's struggle for revenge while trying to keep hold of his humanity will keep you engaged until the very end; this movie is an action movie, but it is also a very human drama, which is ironic because the main characters happen to be apes.9/10 (Review available to read on my blog - if interested, please click on my account and follow the link to my blog!)","

"harry_tk_yung","25 July 2017","""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was filmed as one continuous movie, then released in three consecutive years. But that was mainly because of the integrity of the source material. The rebooted ""Apes"" trilogy (""Rise"", ""Dawn"", ""War"") is exceedingly well conceived and planed. It is quite plausible that when the first one was filmed, they knew exactly what the third one will be like, at least in broad strokes even if not in minute details.Picking up from where ""Dawn"" left off, ""War"" starts with the unsurprising scenario that humans do not want to leave Caesar and the peace-seeking apes alone. Joined by war-seeking followers of Koba ( after his death) they track down Caesar, only to be defeated and captured. Caesar sends the human captives back, telling them to give their leader a message of goodwill. ""They will give the message?"" one of Caesar's compatriots asks. ""THEY are the message"". Such dialogue is unlikely to be found in mindless summer action ""blockbusters"".What follows is a very familiar scene of affectionate reunion of family and friends when Caesar and his troop return to the community. At this point, even if you have not had the familiarity with the physical appearance of apes from the previous two movies, you would likely have forgotten that you a watching apes. Brilliant motion-capture actors (particular Andy Serkis's iconic portrayal of Caesar) and CGI definitely contribute. But the familiar sentiment is the same whether it is the community of apes from minorities of the real world, say, aboriginal people with their privacy disturbed by explorers, slave brought back from a different continent, or victims of genocide by mad political leaders under the illusion that their race is supreme.The remainder of the movie can be broadly divided into two parts: Caesar (and a few companions) on the road, and Caesar in captivity.Caesar's quest is to look for his youngest son, as well as to face the ultimate villain The Colonel (perfectly cast Woody Harrelson). During the first part, which is not unlike a road movie, two more people are picked up, a human pre-teen girl Nova that does not have the facility of human speech and a physically unimpressive fugitive ape ""Bad ape"" that turns into a comic side-kick on this journey. The obvious irony here is that while the human cannot speak, the ape can. The reason soon becomes apparent. There is a new strain of virus that deprives human of the ability to speak, nature's punishment with Biblical flavour.The next part, when Caesar alone is captured, unfolds like an allegory of two other movies. Caesar as a leader of prisoners forced to do hard labour without adequate food will remind you of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). The ultimate escape, to a lesser extent, has traces of ""The Great Escape"" (1963). The highlight is the confrontation between The Colonel and Caesar. At their first close-up face-to-face, Colonel say ""I can't kill you. Look at your eyes, almost human"". Later, he keeps commenting that Caesar is ""too emotional, taking things too personal"". He has a reason of sorts for saying this: while he has killed Caesar's son, he also killed his own son to help prevent the above-mentioned virus, ""nature's punishment of our arrogance"".The ultimate, often hinted, twist is that the ""war"" is not with apes after all, but between two groups of militant humans, culminating in mutual annihilation. As Caesar looks upon the carnage, the audience may recall an indelible image from the original ""Planet of the apes"" (1968), when Charlton Heston, in absolute shock and despair, looks upon the ruins of the Statue of Liberty with the devastating realisation that this ""planet of the apes"" is what home will become in future.Now, fifty years later, they (audience) understand why, courtesy of a brilliantly constructed trilogy.","

This scene did not happen! The ending battle scene was between human armies with the apes running away like - apes. The final scene was too short and totally implausible, with only one grenade aimed at an exposed oil tank left in the open right behind the wall, setting of an explosion that destroys the whole base. I also do not understand why the mute girl Nova was introduced in the story. I think this movie cannot possibly deserve a 8.4 rating on IMDb, it must be all the studio trolls at work.","

"rcowles0324","17 July 2017","""War"" is a difficult movie to review, and honestly, there's not a lot to say about it. After any given movie is finished, and my companion and I walk out of the theater, we're usually discussing the movie (good or bad). This one we didn't. And honestly, by the time we drove home, it didn't matter and I didn't care. The movie was, overall, that forgettable.From a cinematography, CGI, and FX standpoint, War is fine. Maybe even excellent. But then, it's 2017. I expect that in sci-fi or fantasy movies. There are no ground breaking visuals in the movie. The main characters are fleshed out fairly well, although the script (and director) fall into a completely unnecessary Jar-Jar Binks comedic character trap with one of the leads. The pacing of the film is slow. I don't mind a long picture if the content and pacing justify the length - which doesn't happen in War. And I shouldn't come out of a monkey movie that on one level is so very depressing I wanted to slit my wrists. There were plot holes galore, only about 20 minutes of real action, and like I said earlier, it was instantly forgettable. War is supposed to be (I guess) a movie that makes you think, but in reality, it's a schizophrenic mess with good optics. I would not watch it twice.","

"kamykaza","20 July 2017","The best thing you can do about War for the Planet of the Apes is, not watch it. If you love or like the first two parts, don't watch it, if this is your first glance to the trilogy, don't watch it. If you are 5 years old and you like apes, enjoy. Where to start? The first half our of the movie can stand alongside the other two entries. It's directing, acting, effects and musical score once again remind us that a good mature sf-drama is not only fiction. But, to my big disappointment after that the movie goes only downhill. As the first movie was one of the most pleasant surprises (where I expected superficial mindless action) this movie is one of the biggest disappointment. There are so many flaws to the story, so many moments that make no sense at all, that the viewers literally cannot feel for the characters. The movie is full of this melodramatic close up, very slow scene that should give meaning to the moment, but they don't because the movie doesn't give us a reason to care for the characters, or for that matter, the world. The main idea behind the movie, that the good guys (apes) have mercy and bad guys (people) don't is also very washed up, seen 100 times and not well done. Acting is for the biggest part CGI, done very well. Woody, doesn't shine, but his character has no time to develop, so he has to do the cliché scene: ""This is why I am evil and this is my evil plan, now I will not kill you but close you in a prison, even though I am ruthless and merciless"" Makes this movie a James Bond movie from the 70s, and not a closure to a great trilogy about one of the most interesting sc-fi stories. So, as I said in the beginning, the best thing you can do, is not watch the movie, and fantasize about how great this movie could have been. Matt Reevs, shame on you.","

"ToxicJug","28 June 2021","War for the Planet of the Apes may not be as good as its two predecessors but it still manages to send the trilogy off on a high note. I may have mentioned this in both of my reviews for the previous two films but its simply impossible not to mention when reviewing this trilogy. The visuals throughout this film absolutely steals the show! War for the Planet of the Apes easily has the most convincing visual effects of the entire trilogy which is obviously an impressive feat to say the least. The action sequences are also incredible as expected from this trilogy by this point. Where the film falls behind for me in comparison however, is it's pacing as well as its ending. War is paced nowhere near as well as the first two and can feel a bit slow and even boring at times which was a major issue for me. Ontop of that the ending just wasn't satisfying for me at all especially given that it was the finale of Cesar's story. Cesar's story and his legacy is something that has been built throughout the entirety of this trilogy and ends rather abruptly within this film.. other than those issues, this is still an incredible sci-fi action film that will tug on your heartstrings as much as it will have you cheering on the edge of your seat!","

"TxMike","18 November 2017","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are great, the several explosions made my viewing room shake. Of course you need a good powered subwoofer for that.This all started, moviewise, with the 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"", based on an earlier French book. In that story 20th century space travelers somehow zip to the far future where Apes are the intelligent species and what we know as Humans are the ones captured and caged. At the end we see the remnant stubble of the Statue of Liberty and realize something very bad happened on Earth.The current series of Apes movies actually fill in that space in time between a catastrophic event and the rise of the intelligent Apes. In this version it isn't a war, it is Simian Virus stemming from experiments with caged Apes.The Ape leader is again Andy Serkis as Caesar, raised from very young by a human family, and as a mature Ape speaks well and has human qualities. All the surviving Apes want to do is live peacefully in their home in the forest.That plan is upset by Woody Harrelson as the rogue military Colonel. He and his men seek to exterminate the Apes and that conflict is the core of the story here. We can look at it as sheer entertainment, we sense that Apes becoming human-like is just a Sci-Fi fantasy. Or we can look at it as an allegory, those with power seeking to dominate others.The cutest character is an Ape named ""Bad Ape"" and played by Steve Zahn. He had learned to talk and when in captivity had often been yelled at ""bad Ape"" so he came to think that was his name. A wrinkle in this story is that the virus gradually allows Apes to develop the ability to speak, and at the same time gradually renders Humans unable to speak.It runs over two hours but never seems long.","

"tfoxk1","18 July 2017","The focus of the film is entirely from the perspective of the Apes. Humanity is devolving into mindless, mute, psychopaths. Only two human characters receive any character development, Woody and Nova. Nova realizes humans are garbage and tries to become an ape. A nice reference to the original, amazing Planet of the Apes with Nova's name. The naming should have been more creative than having an ape name her from the discarded vehicle badge from a Chevy. I left once the avalanche destroyed the human Army. Like Woody, I kept hoping humanity would survive the war of the apes. This movie turned the United States, US military, mankind, logical movie plots, and the original masterpiece into a travesty. The CG was at least good.","

"Carycomic","15 July 2017","Sorry! I just had to get that out of my system. Now, to be serious.In terms of bringing a trilogy full circle, in a good way, this film delivered. The CGI motion capturing and voice-over dubbing were, once again, superb (especially in Andy Cirkis' case). And the writing worthy of Rod Serling's first draft script for the 1968 classic!By that, I mean the screenplay for this movie does a credible job filling in the back story gaps left behind by the original quintet of films from Apjac and 20th Century Fox. Like, for instance; how could just one thousand years of ""barbarity,"" alone, reduce Linda-- the original Nova--Harrison's people to mute hunter-gatherers? Could it have been a slower-acting, undiagnosed side-effect of the same space germ that killed off all the cats and dogs on Earth (as mentioned in CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES)? Speaking of Nova: young Amiah Miller was suitably tender to watch in her interactions with Luca and Maurice. I hope she does at least a couple more films before heading off to college in six years. And Steve Zahn provides hilarious (and occasionally much-needed) comic relief as the Ben Gunn-esque Bad Ape.Last, but not least? Let's talk about Woody Harrelson. He's come a long way since his days as the relatively unknown replacement for Nicholas Colasanto on CHEERS. And his spot-on homage, to Marlon Brando's second-most famous character, proves once and for all that this guy is just plain versatile!In short; don't waste your money on WISH UPON. Go see this flick, instead.","

The interesting things (for me) was having Cornelious and Nova as those two, in grown up version are in the Charlton Heston movies. I also liked the music which can be described as ape drums. However overall this is just a boring film.","

"michael-kerrigan-526-124974","20 October 2018","War for the Planet of the Apes. Thought it would be a 6 like the other two in the trilogy. They were very watchable but not a touch on the originals. This last one in the trilogy was by far the best. Just the right amount of action (i.e not much) and enough anti-war sentiment and human/ape emotion to give it a thoroughly enjoyable 8 out of ten.
Second watch 4 years later......
Just watched war for the planet of the apes for the second time. Last saw it at cinema and gave it 8 then. This time I watched it at home on a 4K monitor. An absolute visual delight underpinned by a tense and tender 'human' drama. Absolutely brilliant - 9 out of ten","

"lucasnmnboyd","22 July 2017","I was a huge fan of the first two re-boots. They had great character development, chemistry and personal conflicts that I could relate to, kinda, considering I'm a human. The second movie had perhaps the greatest movie moment ever; a crazed ape riding a horse, screaming and wielding two machine guns. But that movie made it work! I remember thinking to myself...THIS is why I love movies.I went into this one thinking it would follow suit and be even better than the last. Seriously disappointed. First, the good parts. Obviously, the CG is incredible. Ceaser is smarter and more badass than ever (at least in the beginning), and Andy Serkis proves that he's the master of this kind of work. Even his voice is impressive. The chemistry between he and his fellow apes is still pretty much there, he's still revered and respected, I guess. The visions of Koba were pretty cool. Aside from that...the bad parts.What I walked away thinking was that Ceaser didn't really do anything the entire movie besides deny help from his followers. He's supposed to be smarter than that. The fact that he was so determined to abandon all the apes he spent years building a relationship with just made me think less of him. That was not the Ceaser I fell in love with over the first two movies. Sure, I suppose he realized what's important by the end, but he wasn't the beast he was before. There was one good moment between he and the Colonel; after this tense scene I thought Woody Harrelson was actually going to be a good villain. After suffering through the ridiculous military decisions, cheap attempts at humor with the old ape, discount Abigail Breslin that really had no need to be there, I thought maybe we will get the kind of showdown these movies make great. What we got was this pretty well thought out sicko reduced to a bumbling mess because of a disease that was dormant in his body for fifteen years. Right then, it takes effect. What a cop out.I also thought the score was kind of weak. And I was honestly groaning at the 'single tear' cliché; there were far too many to be taken seriously. By the end, Ceaser gives up because they made it 'home'. Also seemed like a cop out. I know he isn't as young as he used to be but we have seen him take far worse punishments over these movies than an arrow. At this point I was hoping he'd see that window from his past as he died. The second one referenced the first one beautifully and I think this was their chance they didn't take.I suppose the point of the movie is to say that our conflicts are futile as nature will eventually win over everything. That's a thought provoking concept, and I appreciate the direction they were trying to take things. But think they should have kept things a bit lighter; the concentration camp feel just doesn't work with a PG-13 rating. They weren't able to take things as far as they needed to go and therefore felt kind of silly.I'm hoping they are done with these. There is nowhere to go now, and perhaps that was the point. Again, disappointment. Nowhere near the quality of the first two.","

"Tweetienator","1 October 2017","I was never a fan of the new versions - imo the first Planet of the Apes from 1968 with Charlton Heston is way better than the new ones altogether. The first one of the new movies was okay, but this last one is just bad.On top the guy responsible for that bad kitsch soundtrack should be banned from making any kind of music for a movie ever ;) Some scenes spiced with that cheesy music - I really had a good laugh, but I think there was some other emotional reaction from the audience intended or the ""drums"" as Woody hit first time the screen, jeez, really bad stuff it is. And the piano plong plong, really, mostly a not so good soundtrack at least doesn't disturb me, but this is an exceptional example of kitsch. If I ever get caught by whatever mad-hatter and tortured with that soundtrack I will be dead within the hour :DSumma summarum: you get a lot of apes, standard CGI-action, and a plot that could be the script for some C-Western from the 50s.This and last year Hollywood's output mostly really sucks - one by one bad or mediocre movies are released: even big franchises (Tarzan, King Kong, Apes, King Arthur, Transformers etc.) or big actors can't save or disguise the fact that most of the stories told are just bad and ueber-generic stuff, in comparison even the cheap stories published in the good old pulp magazines read like the writings of Satre or Kafka himself.","

"dk777","10 March 2022","The first film in this trilogy is interesting, with intriguing characters and a good story. This movie has none of that.The main villain is hilarious, as is the ending of the trilogy. The film is boring, and was supposed to be the best part of the trilogy.The scene in which The Colonel is giving a speech is so hilarious that for a moment I thought I was watching a parody. Woody Harrelson is a great actor, it's a shame the script is so bad.The script is disastrous, I was expecting a fun movie, and in the end it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've watched.The story suffers from the usual flaws of today's film production, the film is so pretentious that it's impossible to take it seriously, and worst of all, it's boring.The ending is particularly hilarious, but it fits the film, because in this film, everything is catastrophic. The title of the film is War for the Planet of the Apes, but there is no war, just a boring soap opera with CGI monkeys in the lead roles.A horrible script, a catastrophically bad story, a slow and boring film, with a hilarious ending that really looks like some kind of parody.A complete waste of time.","

"AudioFileZ","4 December 2017","So many thought this should be an epic battle and didn't get it? Obviously that has fueled so much of the negative reviews. What did they expect? Two hours of the first battle which is good, by the way? How would that make a far better film?What we get is the most elaborate CGI in the franchise with a kind of mutated evolution story. It's not like war doesn't bring out some of the worst of humanity. That's nothing to just dismiss. So, we get a fair story of the apes led by Ceasar attempting to balance their own hate and distrust of the remaining humans who still just won't leave them be. Or at least a sizable rogue group of humans are out for blood. True, it's rather simplistic, but think how often interfering using war backfires. It's kind of like ignoring history and blindly attempting to create something that will never be. So, instead of being insulted by the story I say just roll with it. I mean the apes are at the dawning here of mutant bit of humanity where they're just saying leave us be and we'll do the same. When neither side can outright win maybe that's the solution even if the humans take longer to get on board. I guess turning a mirror on some of this old thinking hits people the wrong way when it's grafted onto a sacred movie franchise? This movie isn't trying to make a social statement though because it's just entertainment. Just a story which to some because it's Planet of the Apes is a let down. Get over it.If you're looking for constant violent action scenes I know where you stand. If you're looking for fantastic CGI with some action and an OK story you'll be able to say it's a pretty good flick.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","12 September 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a mouthful of a title, and the film itself provides satisfactory beats that the last two films were leading up to. We're closer to the world seen in the original Planet of the Apes, though this one presumably takes place in a totally different timeline and universe to the classic Charlton Heston film from 1968. And there's a very odd thing happening here with these reboot movies: every sequel in THIS series is better than the previous sequels. 'War' is a great sequel to 'Rise' and 'Dawn' respectively; and the sequels to 'Rise' have been much stronger than the sequels to the original Planet of the Apes film. At least I think these sequels are stronger than the past ones.Andy Serkis is great here, Woody Harrelson is great too (a bit of a Hitler and Trump thing going on with his character I think), and this film is memorable conclusion to a trilogy of films we didn't know we wanted to have. There's sure to be more films down the track from 'Apes', but damn 'War' is a good film in itself.See this one once it's out on DVD and BluRay, or Digital Video.","

"blazedounal","18 August 2017","I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me but after seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that the previous films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly good movie. I was incredibly disappointed. The first 10-20 minutes were...pretty good...but then it all went downhill from there and THERE IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes. Not a second more. The third movie is bad.Two years after the U.S. military was called to fight off an increasingly intelligent and dangerous tribe of apes,led by the chimpanzee Caesar, are attacked in the woods by a Alpha-Omega, led by a ruthless Colonel. Alpha-Omega also has in its service apes they call ""donkeys"" that had previously followed Koba (the monkey). During the attack, the Alpha-Omega militants are met by heavy ape resistance, and several soldiers, including a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured by the apes. Caesar arrives and orders the four human soldiers to be released, with a message to the Colonel that he did not start the war, and that he desires peace between the humans and apes. Caesar orders that Red is to be imprisoned for his crimes, but before he can be imprisoned, Red escapes, injuring an albino gorilla named Winter. Soon after, Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his lieutenant Rocket return from a journey to find a safe haven for the apes. They report that they have found a place across the desert that is perfect for the clan. Winter, still frightened from the soldiers' attack, wants to leave immediately, but Caesar does not think they are prepared to leave so soon. That night, a group of Alpha-Omega soldiers, led by the Colonel, infiltrates the apes' home behind a waterfall and the Colonel kills Caesar's wife, Cornelia, and Blue Eyes. Winter cannot be found and he betray the apes.Leaving his younger son, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' mate, Lake, Caesar departs to exact revenge on the Colonel for the death of his family. He is accompanied by some apes, while the other apes head for the desert. During their journey, the apes encounter a soldier living in an abandoned village and Caesar shoots him when he reaches for his rifle. Caesar, Maurice, Luca, and Rocket search the dead soldier's home. Maurice discovers the soldier's daughter who is apparently unable to speak. Maurice befriends and adopts the girl, giving her a small rag doll.Along the way Caesar's party encounters Winter in an Alpha-Omega camp on the beach. He tells Caesar's group that the Colonel has departed for a location referred to as the ""border."" Winter tries to call out to the Alpha-Omega soldiers to save him, but Caesar and the others killing him. Caesar begins to worry that he is becoming like Koba by killing his fellow apes and seeking revenge. While following the soldiers to the border, they discover some soldiers who have been shot and left for dead. Their examination of a soldier who survived reveals that he, like the girl, cannot speak. Later the group meets Bad Ape. Bad Ape reveals that the human soldiers are encamped at the border.When the group arrives at the border, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from an Alpha-Omega patrol, angering Caesar and causing him to proceed alone. Caesar discovers the rest of his ape clan has been captured, and are being forced to build a wall with no food or water; he is captured by Red. The Colonel reveals to Caesar that the Simian Flu virus has mutated and now causes humans who becoming mute and regressing back to a primitive state. Caesar deduces that the Colonel is barricading himself in the facility to fend off remnants of the U.S. Army from the north who are coming to execute him because he favors massacring any infected humans, including his own son, to stop the spread of the virus. Caesar is commended by the Colonel for his intelligence, and the Colonel explains that he is fighting a ""holy war"" for the survival of mankind.While Caesar is in the camp, the mute girl sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To prevent Nova from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive, and confiscates Nova's doll upon discovering it. Together Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel that leads out of the facility. Maurice and Bad Ape use the tunnel to rescue the apes, and Caesar orders the others to escape while he goes to confront the Colonel. As the facility comes under attack by the northern army, Caesar reaches the Colonel. As Caesar is about to kill the Colonel, he realizes that Nova's doll has infected the Colonel with the mutated virus, rendering him unable to speak. Caesar puts down his gun and spares the Colonel, who then uses the gun to commit suicide rather than become a primitive.During the battle between Alpha-Omega and the northern army, the escaping apes come under fire from Alpha-Omega. Caesar attempts to attack Alpha-Omega forces from behind, but is shot with a crossbow by Preacher. Red saves Caesar's life by killing Preacher with a grenade launcher, and is executed by an Alpha-Omega superior as a result. Caesar blows up a large fuel tank, causing a cascade of explosions which destroy the Alpha-Omega facility and allow the northern army to win the battle. However, the army is subsequently devastated by an avalanche, which Caesar and the other apes, carrying Nova, survive by climbing nearby trees.The remaining apes depart the facility and cross the desert to find an oasis. Caesar have his wound and slowly and silently succumbs to his wound and die.","

"JGar40","21 July 2017","In truthfulness, I was going to give it a 9 but after seeing so many repulsive reviews I'm giving it a 10. The cinematography and the CGI is the best in the film industry and it's just unbelievable. This is not a war film contrary to the title which is part of why people are leaving bad reviews. This is a sci-fi film that also explores what people are willing to do to survive and it explores the dark side of human nature. I feel a lot of people came in expecting some epic CGI futuristic ape v human because they never watched the first 2 films. Caesar played by Andy Serkis has his strongest performance yet and ends this trilogy very well. New character Bad Ape is not necessary but provides a little comic relief in an otherwise dark film. In a throwback to the source material and older films we have Nova, a little girl who is important to the plot. Overall this a great film and a good end to this ape trilogy and I do hope we have more Planet of the Apes films like this in the future. I think most of the people who are reviewing really don't understand cinema and are partially hating it because it's not a War film. If you haven't seen the first two films and will be bored because it's not the way it's advertised don't watch. But I recommend this as it is a masterpiece. Also I saw some reviews calling out racial or sexist undertones which is completely false","

"jalvarad","13 August 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is another modern reboot of a sci-fi series that has entertained generations of moviegoers since its beginning in 1968. So, it is no surprise that the new reincarnation has done remarkably well at the box office. However, unless you main criterion for watching movies is the pure fascination that comes from special effects, you will certainly be disappointed by it. The movie starts basically where the previous one left it off. From that point forward, it is hard to grasp the main story-line since bits of distracting scenes are poorly woven in the fabric of the plot. Moreover, the intractable plot comes across as being too dark with themes such as revenge, punishment, and mercy killings (and suicide) that hardly make the movie entertaining unless one is easily distracted by the special effects and battle scenes that continuously take over the movie. In the end, it basically becomes clear that director Matt Reeves has little appreciation for structure and is more interested in pleasing those that have short-term memory spans and/or easily excited by eye-catching specials effects of apes' facial expressions and combat scenes. Let's hope that the next Apes' movie would have more things to offer, at least for entertainment purposes.","

"mitchell5954","17 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is the third installment of this reboot POTA trilogy, though there could easily be more. This is a series of films that I initially didn't care, but grew to really enjoy. The first film, Rise, I still think is just okay. It's definitely not bad, but I find it heavily overrated. However, the second movie, Dawn, I love, and think is vastly superior to its predecessor. The effects, story, and characters are all better, and the dynamic between Caesar and Koba is just brilliant. So I was hyped for this movie before it came out. Does it live-up to the hype? Yes.I still think Dawn is the best of the movies, but this is definitely a worthy sequel and final installment of this franchise, or at least this portion of it. This has been an interesting trilogy. Usual in these big franchises the first movie is good, the second is just as solid, if not better, and the third installment is the weakest. In this case the first film is the weakest, the second is best, and the third is really good. The only other trilogy I know that has played out like this has been the Captain America trilogy.The end of Dawn set-up the final war between the humans and the apes. War takes place a couple years after Dawn where the apes are trying to find a way out of the forest and into a new land where they can call home. Before he can do that though Caesar seeks revenge against Woody Harrelson's character, the Colonel. The first half is essentially a journey of revenge for Caesar, and the second is an escape movie.This film does almost everything right. The effects are stunning. Dawn is overall a better film to me, but when it comes to the effects War takes the cake. People raved about Rise's effects when it came out. War makes the effects in that look almost amateurish.Caesar remains the best part of this franchise (along with Koba). He's an amazing character, and has come so far from his humble beginnings in Rise. If you come into this movie wanting constant action you will be disappointed on that front. The title and trailers are a bit misleading. This is more of a dreary drama for Caesar and the apes with some action in the beginning and end.The first and third acts are amazing, especially act one. The first act feels like a dreary post-apocalyptic film like The Road. It's moody, dark, and very atmospheric with minimal music. The music used enhances the dreary atmosphere. The third act confrontation is also great. Possible spoiler; the very end reminded me of the ending to Exodus in the Bible. I get the feeling that was intentional. It was a good way to wrap-up Caesar's story.There are a couple issues I have that prevent this from being a perfect movie. Firstly, the second act, with the apes imprisoned, did drag on a bit too long in my opinion. It was still good, and there were some good interactions with the humans and apes, to be honest there were times where I got a little bored and was waiting for some real progression. In Dawn I was never bored. Each scene in that film was engaging and felt necessary. They also threw-in some humor that didn't quite work. Fortunately, there was not much of that.They also threw in a new ape character who was basically the comic relief, but he didn't annoy me that much. Also, his presence provided the main character, and by extension the audience, with some interesting world building.Lastly the villain, Woody Harrelson, while good, was a disappointment. This is mainly because both the trailers and the film itself hyped this guy up to no tomorrow to be Caesar's ultimate nemesis, but he really wasn't. Koba is still the best villain in this franchise (and one of my favorite villains period). On a side note I liked how Koba is both in the film and not in it at the same time. I really liked how the film utilized Koba, which is what drove Casear's arc in this.The colonel was still a decent villain who you can understand his motivations, and Woody Harrelson gives a good performance, but he was ultimately nothing. I do like the twist the film did with the virus, which ties into the ending with the colonel, but it still felt a bit anticlimactic given the hype.Overall, War for the Apes was a satisfying conclusion to the Caesar trilogy. If you liked the previous two installments this one won't disappoint. The thing is, even though this trilogy is done, they could easily make many more films and play in this universe, much like Star Wars, if they wanted. I have a feeling they will too.","

"o-12574","20 April 2020","As a series of stories, he makes a good beginning and a good ending, which fully shows Caesar's hesitation and helplessness towards human beings and his peers, his promise to himself and his struggle against human beings. Tell the story. But as a Hollywood commercial he was a flop, there was no deflagration, no blinding special effects to excite the audience, and it was hard for anyone who hadn't seen or felt the first two films to resonate and pay for it","

"branflakes4547","28 May 2019","This is such an excellent movie and a perfect capper to the trilogy. In terms of summer blockbusters it is nearly perfect save for Wopdy Harrelson phoning it in the entire time. The ending and buildup and cinematography and acting and production quality are all top notch. Nearly incredible I would recommend this movie and trilogy to anybody. I don't know why these movies don't get more praise. Perhaps they are overlooked as action schlock- because there's apes using guns riding horses and driving tanks. But do you really need a high brow planet of the apes movie in 2019? I still think about the ending to this movie quite frequently as it really stuck with me. Go rent this trilogy and start from the beginning (the 2011 film with James Franco) they get better with each one and this one is one of the best summer blockbusters in recent memory (except for Mad Max of course)","

This movie makes you care for a bunch of CGI characters and it keeps you interested, even with very little spoken dialogue. Who would have thought that a Planet of the Apes movie would be one of the better dramas of the year?","

Three groups of people walked out on the film - I would have except we were in the center of the aisle. Too predictable, too hokey, way too juvenile. And the special effects were great for the monkey faces but amateurish for everything else. Oh, and plot holes galore (not that you'd look for a plot in a movie about talking monkeys). Oh, oh....AND Bad Ape can give Jar Jar Binks a run for his money for most irritating character in a movie series.","

Anyone else would quickly find a similar endless succession of battle scenes pointless, tedious and extremely boring.For those of us who like a great movie, and who like to have our minds and emotions engaged while watching, War for the Planet of the Apes supplies a complex and detailed story with plenty of everything that makes us love the experience, including great work behind the scenes (the CGI is amazingly realistic and the visuals very lush and detailed), as well as behind the camera and in front of the camera.War for the Planet of the Apes is a very satisfying movie. Highly recommended for everyone (except 3D-war-and-action game addicted kids, teens and teens who never grew up).","

"DarkVulcan29","14 July 2017","Rise was awesome, Dawn was great, but War really knocks them both down by far.Caeser(Andy Serkis) is sent on a path of revenge after a sadistic colonial(Woody Harrelson)and his fellow soldiers kill several apes and Caeser's family. And while some ape comrades join Caeser on his path, Caeser wonders will he become has bad as the colonial.Andy Serkis really gives another good as Caeser, a very good motion capture performance. Woody Harrelson also steals some scenes has the bad guy, when you look into his eyes you really see madness, but there is one scene where his character explains why he does what he does, and that I believe should get Harrelson an Oscar nomination, cause he was so riveting. At times the movie feels like a two part, one part revenge drama, and second part escape drama. The other actors in motion capture suits also do well when acting has smart apes. I feel the ending really sets up for the 1968 film starring Charlton Heston.","

"cks116633","24 July 2017","To start, this is the first movie I've ever reviewed. After seeing this movie I felt the need to get my opinion out. So, what a long journey from the city of Misstreadedville with a final destination at Depressingland it was. You're telling me it's not enough that he is running for his life to save his people (depressing). His wife and one kid get killed (even more depressing). But wait, there's more, he and his people become slaves (thanks for reminding me about the worst tragedy in the history of the world). So here's our chance for an awesome battle with good apes and good humans. Epic action to see Caesar be his hardcore self, right? Nope. We see him battle no one and get shot by the person he spared. What an opportunity for mercy to be given back. So that's it right? Wrong again. We see super smart Caesar, not plug his wound and travel through the desert bleeding out. As a father he must have some small attachment to his soon to be orphan kid right. Wrong again.So finally we arrive at Depressingland. To say I demand an alternate/extended ending is an understatement. Please fix this.","

"leonidasoriginal","17 July 2017","Great movie, showing that franchises can have a good continuation. Went to see this movie last night. Bought some big-ass popcorn and took my lady to a cinema to see this new ""apes stuff"". Little did we know she'll cry a bit at some parts, and I'll act like some sh*t fell into my eye just to keep all man-the-f-up vibe going on. OK, seriously now. This is well produced, well-made and quite emotional movie. From beginning to the end, it has well-balanced pace. Emotions, such as anger, sadness, joy etc. are not exaggerated and the viewer can get a good feeling about the entire situation, which makes this movie very enjoyable and watchable. Cesar is well developed as a character and you can compare him to a real person. He has sort of Denzel Washington vibe in my personal opinion, tho played by amazing Andy Serkis (do understand this is meant entirely as personality traits with deep respect to Mr. Washington as a person and actor.) Woody Harrelson does his part well. He is kind of an actor that comes into the picture, you never expect something big from him, but he always delivers his part and does it great. (Having 2012 in my mind for example).I do miss more of a backstory for some other characters. How, why etc. but that would make movie 5 hours long.CGI is well made, believable, the action is also well produced, well paced and there is this funny, goofy ape, played by excellent Steve Zahn, that brings just enough fun into the otherwise somewhat sad story, balancing the entire atmosphere.Most of all, I honestly think that director is a person than deeply condemns society and all we do in terms of war, destruction and everything humanity does. We are violent, self-important with complete disregard to consequences of our deeds. This is not ""save the monkeys"" babbling, but more of a rhetoric question ""why are we such a violent species?""I'm probably shooting far, but I see this movie it as a critique of the whole of humanity.Glad I saw this at the cinema.","

"adamjohnfuller","17 August 2017","This film is actually very good. I don't get all the hate. I understand those who dislike the anti-white/anti-Christian themes that are apparently there. I myself am a center-right white Christian and didn't see them except in one scene. They aren't as heavy-handed as the other reviewers are trying to make them out to be. From a storytelling standpoint, this film is fantastic. Efficient, eloquent, and kinetic, the story's pace is it's only weakness, more than made up for by the brilliant content and scenework. The combat scenes are the most epic thing since The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and are made only more powerful because they are rare, only to be found at the very first scene and the last few scenes. However, every scene in this film is filled with conflict, the narrative drive of this film never misses a beat, even if not every scene is about a big battle. There is not a single expositional scene in the film save one, and that scene still moves the story forward, so technically it's not an expositional scene. From a technical standpoint, the film is brilliant, Every shot is nothing more than pure art, the CGI is the best I've ever seen, the set pieces are breathtaking, and the musical score, while subtle, does nothing but help the story feel tangible and authentic. The acting is phenomenal, particularly the performances of Harrelson and Serkis. The morally complex layout of the story is halfway to perfection, the haunting hallucinations of Koba represent Caesar's own mental dilemmas and his fear of becoming that which he swore he would never become. Although the film does fall short in being overly simple from a moral standpoint (ape = good, human = bad, almost without exception) it still does a fascinating job on showing the complex nature of Caesar's Moral Character. As this review clearly demonstrates, the film is very good.My real critique is not of the film, but the other reviewers here on IMDb, all of the 2-star and 1-star reviews are completely misleading and just plain disrespectful to the filmmakers involved on this project.These absurdly low reviews are meant for films like The Room or The Emoji Movie, if a film is just plain awful in every sense of the word, then it deserves a low rating. Not just whether you liked the movie or not. I humbly ask my fellow reviewers to put their personal feelings toward a film aside and just judge a movie based on its storytelling and technical qualities.Matt Reeves, Mark Bomback, Andy Serkis, and everyone else who was involved in some way in the film, I apologize for the total and absolute disrespect you are receiving for this film on IMDb, not that you care, being successful and all. But still, it troubles me that professional filmmakers and actors and animators can cook up something this good and have it be completely rejected by a snobby and overly emotional group of ""reviewers"".","

"colewaters","22 July 2017","War For The Planet of the Apes was a fantastic film especially in 3D. Once again Ceaser was the main Ape and I was super excited to see that. The film was kind of confusing at first, but it quickly became really enjoyable this was by far the best in the series. The 3D in this movie was stupendous every second of the 3D was amazing. Woody Harleson was great acting in this movie like always.Parents this movie is really violent with a lot of war violence and brutal action so if you don't want your little ones to see this kind of movie then just wait till they get older but show it to them in 3D. Like I said in my Dunkirk review this film was perfection and the director did a great job directing the film.

"Robert_duder","14 August 2017","If nothing else The new Plant of The Apes series proved why ""reboots/remakes"" can be a very good thing. This series has been unbelievable for action, special effects, drama and a new twist on an old story. The character development for a group of CGI apes is completely astonishing. The first two films were staples of my previous summers. I was very excited to see the latest film and I was not disappointed. War for The Planet Of The Apes is not the best of the three but it's also more story driven and wrapping up any loose ends to this particular part of the story (Caesar's Trilogy.) The battle scenes are quite brutal and the interesting thing is you see an evolution to this trilogy where in the original film the focus was on James Franco and his pet ape, the second film balanced the human story with the Apes and now you have this third film where this is entirely from the view of the Apes as they work to build their own land and freedom. The only ""good"" human in the film is one who is almost completely de-evolved. I have always respected how much time and effort they spent on these films and that nothing was ever rushed or pushed. I think they end this perfectly and perhaps leave enough open for a new direction.I'm not sure anyone realizes what Andy Serkis has done for acting. He doesn't just motion capture is characters. He plays every aspect of this character. He made Caesar a film legend. He has depth of character and evolution over the course of three films. His emotional and brooding expressions and personality make you emotionally invested in this. Woody Harrelson is mesmerizing as the vicious Colonel who is the human embodiment of everything Caesar and his apes have been up against is perfectly cast. Steve Zahn and Karin Konoval are very good as well as Caesar's closest allies and family helping him against The Colonel. Amiah Miller is riveting as the human girl they end up taking along with them. Matt Reeves on the big screen has done some incredible work in my opinion. Let Me In was breathtaking and then Dawn of The Planet of The Apes he made a sequel that in many ways was superior to the first two and is easily one of the best mainstream films in the last decade. I think he had a strong vision for how he wanted this to go and he fulfills that perfectly. If the ultimate Blockbuster is entertaining, emotional and leaves an impression this film works but only has part of the trilogy I think. It lacks some of the depth and urgency of the first two but it does work as a closing statement to this particular chapter. Still one of the best films of the summer. 8/10","

"lucky_star_1","25 July 2017","RISE, DAWN, and WAR are a trilogy of movies in which Andy Serkis acts the hell out of every scene he is in. His emotions are on show 100% and for a CGI character, no words can express just how impressive that is. Caesar will be fondly remembered as a legendary warrior of cinema, certainly the best of his generation, and every single attribute goes towards Mr Serkis' compelling and emotional performance.The journey of Caesar is wrapped up in a beautiful way and should resonate with any human being who feels strongly about the themes of family and survival. Also, I'm truly bewildered by the number of people rating this excellent movie a ZERO on IMDb. WHAT?? Any part of the plot that you had a problem with does not discount the incredible commitment of every cast member and the level they perform that is FAR more realistic than any other movie or television show nowadays.I've read people saying ""the title 'War' is deceptive"" - NO IT IS NOT. These people need to consider the need for BALANCE. If every scene in this movie included fights and soldiers then it would be dull, cold, ineffective - exactly what viewers DON'T want. This movie accomplished something special. It wraps up the franchise without taking anything away from the first two instalments, both of which I loved, and it sets a new challenge for Caesar in which you're once again rooting for his willpower to overcome the struggle.I am thrilled to be part of a generation in which our young audiences have such an inspiring and loving character like Caesar to look up to. This film easily gets a perfect 10. Anything less is an insult. Powerful acting, powerful drama, and powerful conclusion to an amazing franchise that has done the legacy of PLANET OF THE APES extremely proud.","

"Gresh854","14 July 2017","From the beginning I heard this series was going to be made I doubted that'd it be successful, even though I was a fan of the 1968 original. Then I saw Rise, and I absolutely loved that film, making me completely invested and insured in the series seriousness. Then I saw Dawn, and I loved that film even more than Rise. And a couple nights ago, I was crossing my fingers hoping that War could complete this trilogy on a high note. Thankfully, I am glad to say that War for the Planet of the Apes, is by far the best Planet of the Apes movie yet. War is by far surprisingly not only the most intriguing of the two movies, but really the most emotional movie of them all. The movie is advertised as a violent war battle between the apes and the humans, and you do get some of that in this movie, but in reality, this movie is about the conflictions in which Caesar is to undergo. The journey that Caesar takes in this movie is what made me love this film. This film is more of a character piece, than it is an action-packed battle. This film takes the time to sacrifice action sequences, for extremely well written scenes, between characters. I don't want to spoil Woody Harrelson's character. All I'm simply going to say is that he is by far the best human character we've had in this franchise. The main issue I had with most of the new Planet of the Ape films were the human characters. They were just fine and they worked for their purpose, but Harrelson's character is very well developed. You get his motivations, and the reason for why he's the way he is. The element that will stay in your head, I think the most for most audiences, is the way the film produces its sentimental sequences. A majority of those sequences really hit me, right in the heart, and that's rare for a modern day film to do that for me, especially a blockbuster. War is by far, one of the best movies I've seen of 2017, and is the perfect conclusion to the best trilogy I've seen since The Dark Knight trilogy. I'd give War for the Planet of the Apes a letter grade of a solid ""A"".","

Caesar is a terrific character and continues to look fantastic in this; the special effects are top notch, even the way the apes are shown in shot is expertly done. The additions of Bad Ape and Nova are neat, too.I'd personally rank it above 'Dawn' but below 'Rise', though there isn't much between them at all.

They all speak English too - remarkable.The highly predictable and ultimately boring story is on a wholly insufficient scale to call itself a war for a planet. I was mislead into expecting much more war and a scale altogether more planetary.On the plus side, it did fill some time and was very convincing in its depiction of cold weather.","

"ThomasDrufke","14 July 2017","It definitely couldn't have been predicted after Tim Burton botched his 2001 remake, but this particular reboot/re-imagining of the Planet of the Apes series proved to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time. The fact that they managed to make a film that forces an audience to root for the apes over humans is an accomplishment on its own. Caesar's arc through 3 films is one of the most unique and emotionally powerful things that any franchise has given us.Let's start out with the most obvious thing to like about War for the Planet of the Apes, the visuals. In just 6 short years, the CGI/performance capture effects have gone from being impressive to astronomically important. There are recent films that still don't hold up to the precedent set by 'Dawn' a few years ago, and I'm sure it will be years before we see anything close to what Matt Reeves and company did with 'War'. It's also worth mentioning how expanded this cast of characters is to the last film. It's not just Caesar & Koba anymore. We got a deeper look into Maurice, who has always been a favorite of mine in the past few films. Caesar's family grew, hence giving us more apes to care for. And a few new apes that I won't talk about to avoid spoilers. All of them have their own personality and look to them, which makes the visual feats even more impressive.Woody Harrelson came on board to the series as 'The Colonel', a typically bada** character name for Harrelson. Of course, it's no surprise that he stepped up to the challenge of taking on the villain role, after Gary Oldman did a wonderful job the last time around. Much like Oldman's character, the great thing about The Colonel is that he's more than just an intimidating face. As much as this is a 'war' for the planet in a literal way, it may be even more so a 'war' emotionally between Caesar and The Colonel. As expected, Reeves does a great job of balancing out the physical and emotional conflict to incredible results. Actually, because of this, the film ends up going a much more unexpected route than I imagined.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the imagery. This won't be the first review to commend how well Reeves manages to portray Caesar, but I love the way in which he's essentially made into a mythological figure. A figure that will clearly inspire them for generations and all the way up until the original timeline started in 1967's Planet of the Apes. There's nothing more terrifying for a human in this film to see hundreds and maybe even thousands of apes become inspired to revolt because of Caesar. But not just on Caesar's end, the imagery spans every character and every big moment. Nothing was broken up by untimely humor (though there was some surprisingly funny moments) and there weren't any unwarranted or unearned emotional triumphs and losses. This series took its time with storytelling, and it showed.My only real complaint would be that there's a particular group of people that get talked about quite a bit but don't ever receive the proper screen time to warrant them being considered integral to the film. But that's more of a just a comment on how MacGuffin's usually work in films and how it can be frustrating. In all, it's hard to imagine a better conclusion to the Apes trilogy. In my mind, there's no real need to continue it unless it's an unbelievable script, but this was Caesar's arc, and it was perfect.+Satisfying in every possible way+Brutal but emotional+The beautiful imagery+Harrelson and Serkis play well off each other9.7/10","

"thebosontheory","27 July 2017","After I watched this film I saw endless reviews giving the film a 1 out of 10 and I honestly do not understand them at all. I walked into the cinema knowing that I was about to watch a good film due to the success of the previous two, but I didn't realize how good this was going to be!The films grabs you straight away with a fight against the military and the apes and show you where the two factions stand and what has happened since the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. After that the film never drops in quality or entertainment. When you think about it, the story is pretty basic - bad guy kills family member, protagonist wants revenge, gets revenge - simple. But when watching the film you don't even realize how simple it is because they execute it in such an amazing way. In all fairness I was quite disappointed in how the Colonel died. This is the only reason I am giving this review a 9 and not a full 10. I was expecting a big fight scene between him and Ceaser but he ended up killing himself instead? There were so many moments in the film where I was almost in tears, especially at the end when the Apes finally found sanctuary and Ceaser had passed on. The writers did an exceptional job with this scene and didn't make it over dramatic or anything like that and I love them for that.The CGI is again, outstanding and flawless. I have honestly never seen a film with better CGI and Andy Serkis really benefits that with his incredibly performance yet again. The character development in the film is also amazing. Once again Maurice was wise and stuck to himself making him still my favourite character of the franchise. But coming into to a VERY close second is the new character Bad Ape. I've never fell in love with a character more with his shyness and him just being so darn cute with the things he does and says.I've read loads of reviews of this film saying ""there was no war"" or even ""there was no combat"". Well I genuinely think they were watching another film because for a solid 30 minutes the military base is getting blown up and shot down by the enemy.Overall, I believe this film was by far the best film of the franchise and you should all ignore the public reviews that people have posted on here and listen to the Metacritic score of 82 which I think is absolutely spot on!","

"rubya","23 October 2017","I enjoyed the first two films of the latest Planet of the Apes 'series' so I went in thinking it was going to be good without reading any reviews first.It started well enough for a 'war' film but things just went downhill from there. The pace was too slow, the plot extremely weak, a lot of things didn't make sense. It felt like a 5 hour film and I have to admit I dozed off once I was so bored.As others have mentioned in their reviews, there's a girl who doesn't seem to care her dad was killed but cries when an ape she's known for like a day dies. A gorilla who in some scenes is about the same size as a chimpanzee and then riding a horse like it weighs nothing. Then you have a soldier camp manned by a bunch of amateurs who are of course all dressed in dark clothing because they're the bad guys, and get attacked by guys in white cameo who are obviously the good guys, it's not just for the snow, like it's Star Wars and we need the point to be spelled out. Missiles fly everywhere, hitting groups of soldiers rather than the massive fuel tank in the middle of the camp. Then the whole entire ""white"" army just runs up to the camp like storm troopers to conveniently get entirely buried by an avalanche. The end.This film is trying to explain things from the 1968 film but without any imagination. Why wouldn't Caesar try to work out why humans are going mute, could this be a tactical advantage? Rather than a war, with apes taking over humans, he seems to just want his apes to be left alone in a small area so how they end up ruling the planet, I don't know.I only gave 4 stars for the CGI.","

"RforFilm","17 July 2017","If you want to talk about how a proper reboot of a series is done, then The Planet of the Apes is the answer. I'll admit that I've seen none of the old movies, though I'm already aware of the big spoiler from the original, which is practically one of the most famous twists of all time. But I'm not here to talk about those, but rather the reboot movies that started with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Rather then remaking the original, it chose to take a different spin on how the apes became intelligent enough to pose a threat to the humans. Rise of the Planet of the Apes proved to be a major surprise with a lot of critics and audiences finding a lot of sympathy with not only the apes, but apes that were completely computer generated. Plus you have to give a lot of credit to actor Andy Serkis (Gollum from The Lord of the Rings) who brings a lot of depth to his character Caesar and all through the magic of motion capture. Now that Rise and Dawn had built up how this world has succumbed to it's own troubles, we get the finale of the prequel trilogy with War for the Planet of the Apes. Set years after Dawn, Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) is still haunted by his memories of Koba, an ape that started the war between the humans and primates. Though they all seem to be living safe in the Muir forest, the Alpha-Omega, who seem to be the remaining U.S. military forces, come in to try to take out the apes. Caesar announces that he wants the entire clan to move out in the desert where they will be safe from the human. The night before they were to leave, their fortress is attacked and Caesar's wife Cornelia are killed by the leader of the Alpha-Omega, The Colonel (played by Woody Harrelson).Caesar orders the apes to set out for the desert while he heads to the Alpha-Omega headquarters to kill the Colonel in revenge. He's joined by orangutan Maurice, and fellow chimpanzee Rocket to make sure that Caesar is safe. The apes discover many things including a mute human orphan girl that Maurice adopts, an ape named ""Bad Ape"" (played by Steve Zahn), and that the virus that killed most humans may be worse for the ones that lived. Caesar and the apes make it to the headquarters to discover something horrible.As far as this is going, War for the Planet of the Apes continues to rise like the apes who want to be seen as smart and elusive. This movie accomplishes that goal and them some. This happens to be a blockbuster that delivers on the action, but manages to put a lot of emotion into the idea that your about to take on the responsibility of leadership. Sure, some may already see this as a story that doesn't end well for the humans, but you see the tragedy of that the weight Caesar feels when he comes to this conclusion.War for the Planet of the Apes takes cues from the previous Ape movies and revenge westerns to make this the most personal journey for Caesar he has had to undergo. His journey takes him through a beautifully shot film that flows at smooth place, though it does become a little too slow before they reach the humans hideout. Had the CGI been bad, this movie would have fell apart, but I found myself constantly forgetting that I was watching that. The apes have some of the most reactive faces that could rival any bad human actor.Of course I have to talk about Andy Serkis who remains a highly underrated actor. I'm not sure why motion capture performances are rarely noted, but his response through the machines his fantastic. I don't think it's Oscar worthy, but he brings a lot of depth to his character and even seems to connect with his other performances simultaneously to create an arc that spans the three movies. While the humans do well, this movie belongs to the apes who can proudly claim this as their magnum-opus.I'll give this nine Caesars out of ten. While you don't need to see the other movies, I'd still recommend doing so before checking this out. While I'm glad to see this trilogy end on a high note, I'm curious to see if the box office grossings would justify more movies from this series (maybe a possible adaptation of the original Planet of the Apes?). Give the apes their movie and check it out.","

"fkarpenko","22 July 2017","I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me but after seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that the previous films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly good movie. I was incredibly disappointed. **SPOILERS** My first trouble with the film happened with the appearance of the little girl, who seemed to serve absolutely no purpose other than to spontaneously cause tear- jerking moments which were accompanied by sad music in every instance. Throughout the film there must have been around 10 of these, all of them completely pointless and forced. It also baffled me that she had close to 0 reaction to her father dying yet, when a gorilla who she had known for literally one day died, she wept like it was her brother. Another massive problem is that the entire plot of this movie hinges on one condition: that every single person out of the ~1,000 soldiers at the concentration camp is a complete and utter imbecile. Caesar's crew is running around right outside of the walls of the camp? Of course no one notices, why would anyone be on over-watch at a military base? All of the monkeys escape from their cages? Of course there was only one person watching over them. In addition to that, for the duration of what seemed like 10 minutes no one else even noticed that all the monkeys were gone or that the single guard watching over them was killed. Are these real soldiers!? Even statistically, what are the chances that not a single soldier looked at a cage that is in plain view from any part of the camp. These were just the most glaring issues I had with the film. So little thought went into the script. These are incredibly basic problems which could have been fixed with even the slightest effort, This movie was so incredibly dumb that even my friend who doesn't have much interest in film asked me if I wanted to leave before the film was over.","

"facebook-383-422257","16 July 2017","I can count on the fingers of one hand the times I've walked out of a movie theater halfway through a movie. My attempt at watching ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is the third such occasion. And to think I had such high hopes! I can only conclude that everyone who rated the movie here, and all raving reviewers, saw a different cut, or more probably, an entirely different movie.Admittedly, ""War"" is is technically perfect, with awe-inspiring CGI, entirely convincing apes, and spectacular fight and battle scenes. If all a movie needed were good visuals and spectacle, ""War"" would deserve a 10, no discussion.But a good movie needs a convincing plot as well; believable characters with character development and relatable emotions; in short, good writing. And in that sense, this movie furthers the worrying trend of ignoring the need for content in favor of form.It starts in the opening sequence. A battle without a clear point or any reason to care about it, with its own annoying set of logic flaws, is followed by an interrogation scene. In this scene, the characters indulge in shameless exposition, the POWs spilling their beans without hesitation so that the viewer understands what it was all about. This bit actually made me squirm with vicarious embarrassment: lazy plotting and lazy writing taken to a whole new level. (A doomed attempt is made by the sound track composer to enhance this scene with music, but the score is empathic to the point of overbearing, a distraction and an annoyance.)The laziness of both the writers and the directors is also painfully apparent in every single chase and reconnoitering scene. On one occasion, an entire human army travels over a wide-open beach. The ape heroes chase the army, all four of them, on horseback, about a quarter- mile behind the last vehicle, and in plain view. A little later in the movie, they spy on the army's encampment, again up close and in plain view. And what to think of the time they sneak up on a compound, one of the apes says he believes this to be the army's base, and they simply ride in anyway? (Again, to the accompaniment of overbearing music.)SPOILER ALERT: And that particular scene gets worse once they establish that the compound is deserted. They encounter a single human, who despite the odds against him, and the two automatic rifles aimed at him, attempts to draw, and is gunned down. Immediately after, the apes find a little girl, and befriend her without apparent effort, even convincing her to come with them. The fact that they make her walk past the warm corpse of what can only be her dad is compensated, apparently, by the fact that the orangutan hands her a stuffed animals she's half a dozen years too old for. (Cue the overbearing violins.)This is but one example of how emotional development, interactions, and character arcs seem tacked on, unconvincing, fundamentally flawed. It's like the makers thought it sufficient to telegraph emotional development in established movie shorthand: look, here's the dead child, so now the dad is heartbroken and wants revenge! Look, the scary gorilla who killed her dad picked a flower for her, so now the girl will cry her heart out when the ape dies! (To the overbearing sound of an entire orchestra.)The low point in this lazy, unconvincing shorthand is the way the humans are depicted as the worst evil imaginable. Look, not only do they kill apes, they execute their own handicapped, and torture the apes they capture! This is made worse by the fact that in the first hour--the bit I saw--the only point of view is the apes', so the viewer doesn't even get to experience first-hand how and why these atrocities are committed. Maybe the writers thought this would make the horror and evil more believable; the opposite is true. And did I mention the overbearing music?I walked out on ""The man in the iron mask"" because I could not stand the cinematography and nonsense plot line. ""Babel"" made me physically ill. ""War"" is now the third movie I've abandoned. A waste of an hour of my life, a waste of ten of my euros.","

"MrDHWong","27 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot film series. Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield and ""Dawn""), this third and final chapter in the continuing saga of Caesar the ape is easily one of the best conclusions to a film series ever made.Five years after the events of ""Dawn"", Caesar's (Andy Serkis) ape clan are now fighting off the members of a human resistance group known as Alpha-Omega. The leader of the Alpha-Omega is the mysterious Colonel (Woody Harrelson), a cold and bitter man bent on wiping out apes and re-establishing humanity as the dominate species on Earth. After the apes suffer major losses from constant battles against Alpha-Omega, Caesar decides to move them out across the border to a nearby desert, where he and the apes can live peacefully without any danger posed by humans. Along the way, Caesar, who is still haunted by what the rogue ape Koba told him years ago, starts questioning his own sense of morality and tries to come to terms with his inner animal instincts.With eye-popping visuals, great action, and touching moments of drama, War for the Planet of the Apes effectively concludes the ""Apes"" reboot trilogy on a powerful, yet appropriate note. Topping ""Dawn"" was a tall order, but ""War"" definitely succeeds in just about every way. The CG effects were all highly convincing and seem to have improved drastically after each film. As was seen in the previous two films. Andy Serkis is outstanding as Caesar the ape. Forget Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, this is the role Serkis should be remembered for. Woody Harrelson also gives a convincing performance as the Colonel, almost as though he is channelling Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Long time fans of the franchise should keep an eye out for some clever inside references to the other Planet of the Apes films, some so subtle they're hard to pick right away.I rate it a solid 9/10","

"lesleyharris30","15 August 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a largely engrossing film from beginning to end as we follow these group of apes on another adventure leading up to the events of the first Planet of the Apes movie. The stakes are risen even further once again as Caesar is put up against a group of army soldiers that puts their very existence at risk. This film had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and is without a doubt one of the most groundbreaking franchises in Hollywood at the moment.I will admit that it did not grab me as much as Rise or Dawn did, it was a lot slower, taking a lot of time to develop these characters and the new world they are living in, which is fine, but there comes a stage where we would like some action. As well as that, the majority of the movie takes place in one location, and not an exceptionally broad or interesting one, I was getting cabin fever just watching after awhile, I wanted to see these characters move elsewhere. I have absolutely no gripes with the cast here. Woody Harrelson exceeded my expectations as the Colonel, an absolutely gripping, condescending and layered villain that we love to hate. Of course, Andy Serkis hits it out of the park once again as Caesar, it never gets tiring to see him in this part. The amount of depth and vulnerability he puts in to this character is amazing, and the characters arc in this film in particular is heart breaking. An action packed, gripping movie. Proving that you can get the gold three times in a row, War for the Planet of the Apes is a must watch for fans of the series, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. Caesar and the rest of the apes are put in great danger when a ruthless army colonel and his men try to wipe them out. Best Performance: Andy Serkis","

"DrTuvok","14 April 2020","Watching this movie I couldn't help but wonder what would happen to the apes if their horses suddenly got the idea to overthrow their authority; because having two full sized apes riding one horse is more animal abuse than Michael Cimino could dig up in the entire filming of Heaven's Gate.If I couldn't help thinking about these ridiculous things, it was because so little was happening story-wise for nearly the entire movie. It began as a standard revenge story, which, if done rightly, can still be engaging, but the problem director Matt Reeves has here is that he decided to make the main character, Caesar, a model ape who never leaves his bubble of innate goodness. There is no moral dilemma which most revenge stories at least dabble in. Instead Reeves manages to stretch this plod out for over two hours, stuffing it full of overwrought emotions, unbearably slow ape dialogs, and hazy philosophical nonsense. The second movie in this trilogy (the only watchable thing Matt Reeves has directed so far) was far more interesting for depicting a struggle where neither side was really right, but this one just paints an 'all apes are good, all humans are bad' picture. I don't have a problem with good versus evil stories, but since I have a hard time seeing all human beings as inherently evil, it doesn't really work. What happened to the Charlton Heston movie where the apes were seen cruelly hunting humans down as vermin? No one knows. What happened to the satiric edge these movies used to have that even Tim Burton's maligned remake held on to? No one knows. Why is this movie taking itself so seriously when it's about CG apes taking over the world? Who knows. Why are the humans surrounded by religious imagery? Because Matt Reeves apparently likes to fantasize about eradicating religions he doesn't like. Where's the war? We get a couple of small-scale fight scenes, but that's all.And the national anthem scene was beyond stupid. I guess Reeves thought he was really clever in equating monkeys with abused indigenous people or whatever he was trying to do, but it was just disgusting. Besides, the USA is insulted left and right all the time by Hollywood. If Reeves really wanted to be really edgy maybe he should have attacked Communist China, a country which only gets pandered to...Many of the positive reviews on this site are attacking those criticizing this movie as uneducated rubes who know nothing about film. Therefore I think I need to clear myself. If you want an action movie, watch John Woo's the Killer or Hard Boiled. If you want action merged with story, watch Mel Gibson's Braveheart, Apocalypto, or Hacksaw Ridge. If you want a psychological thriller, watch Frankenheimer's Manchurian Candidate, Seconds, or any of Hitchcock's films. (Strangers on a Train is my personal favorite). If you want a biblical movie, watch the Charlton Heston Ben-Hur, the Robe, or Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. If you
Want to see expert cinematography and lighting, see Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. If you want an epic or a war film, try the David Leans, the LOTR trilogy, Kurosawa's Ran, Kubrick's Paths of Glory, Patton, or even the Last Samurai. If you want something newer, try Ridley Scott's the Martian, anything by Chris Nolan, or the Mission Impossible series. If you want a revenge story, you could watch Tarantino, or even better, read the Count of Monte Cristo, probably the best revenge story I've come across. There are so many other things better than this movie, and this one is too pretentious to even be a guilty pleasure.","

"PyroSikTh","18 July 2017","The first thing to make clear is that the marketing for War is slightly off. Just because it has ""War"" in the title, and the trailers are jam-packed full of grand action sequences, doesn't mean it's just a series of Ape v Human battles strung one after the other. In fact it's quite the opposite. There's a skirmish that opens the film, and the large-scale battle at the end (between two human factions), however the middle is more of a revenge tale with holocaust allegories thrown in. If you go into War expecting a full-on action movie, you'll be disappointed and bored, guarantee it. If you go into it as a fan of Rise and Dawn, you'll know that there's more to these movies.War picks up two years after the events of Dawn, with the apes on the run, and the human army mentioned at the end on their tail. As a new place to settle, far away from the military's grasp, has been found, the Apes plan a mass migration. Unfortunately things don't quite go to plan, and Caesar is cast on a journey of revenge, accompanied by franchise stalwarts Maurice and Rocket, as well new gorilla Luca.For a first in the series, and arguably a necessity this time around, War can also be pretty funny. The introduction of Bad Ape not only offers some strong hints as to where the franchise can go from here, but he's also used as comedic relief really well. He had the theatre in the laughter on a few occasions, but it never felt out of place or unnatural.It's not all perfect though. My biggest problem with the movie was the very last moments before the credits rolled. But another minor niggle I had was Caesar's speech. It was used sparingly and effectively in the first two movies, pointing out moments of significance and adding more weight to what was actually being said. In War though, he pretty much talks the whole time. With Koba gone, he was the only Ape left with extensive experience of human language, and so the only one that could talk. So why he talks to his apes almost all the time is beyond me. It reaches peak illogicality when he continues to talk to other apes while in stealth. Surely if you're trying to be quiet and sneaky, and can communicate with sign language, that would be the obvious form of communication you'd use, right? Apparently, Caesar's not as smart as he's meant to be.Visually War is at least on par, if not an improvement on the previous movies. With every passing year, the art of motion capture technology continues to advance and develop, and War is a fantastic demonstration of that. Caesar, Maurice, Rocket, Luca, Bad Ape, and every other primate featured is a massively impressive piece of work. They don't even look CGI'd at all, to the point where I swore they were using animatronics for some scenes (maybe they were, I honestly couldn't tell the difference). There's one moment in particular where we get a close-up of Maurice's face and his expression, and it's the most delicate, perfect marriage of acting performance and computer-generated imagery.On which note the acting in War is incredibly top-notch, maybe even the best of the series. Andy Serkis bows out of the role of Caeser with an incredibly conflicted, moving, and profound performance. You can see his struggle, his rage, his sadness in his face. And his body movements in Ape form are perfect. Karin Konoval's performance as Maurice is just as great as well, showing a tenderness and wisdom so synonymous with his character since Rise, but never really given too much focus. Steve Zahn deserves praise for managing Bad Ape's humorous moments with a seriousness of tragedy that helps the gags not feel out of place in a fundamentally serious and sombre movie. Woody Harrelson also owns the show as The Colonel, and his scenes opposite Serkis are tantalisingly good.The music I feel added a hell of a lot to War's charm as well. I've been disappointed with Michael Giacchino's work recently, as he kept turning in hugely dull and forgettable scores for his movies. The score he's written for War though is possibly the best score he's ever written. It's jam-packed full of emotional weight all by itself, emphasising every scene it's used in in the film itself. A certain recurring piano line is sure to have you welling up with tears before anything even happens, adding a sombre atmosphere to the whole movie. For his more bombastic pieces, he employs a lot of orchestral drums and percussion, along with woodwind instruments you might expect to hear in the original movies from the 60s or 70s. Often the score feels like a homage to those older movies all by itself, and it works fantastically. It's definitely the best score of the franchise, if not one of the top contenders for the whole year.War for the Planet of the Apes unfortunately doesn't shine a light on it's Reeves- predecessor - Dawn is still a masterclass for the franchise - but it's certainly a good follow-up that keeps up it's tone and narrative direction. It's more drama than it is war, but the two bookend action sequences are large and intense enough that they more than make up for it's slower middle. Not that the slower middle is a complaint. I feared it would devolve into a Return of the King-type trilogy closer where half the movie is just one massive battle sequence. Instead I was gifted with something much more emotional and intelligent. That said, it is the only one of the franchise so far that had moments I actively found frustrating. The very end being the movie's biggest offence. I give War a solid, yet imperfect 8/10.","

"akkred","17 July 2017","Visuals are absolutely stunning. Period. I can't write too much about it because the movie looks great!Too bad that the story is stunningly stupid, though. I am a big fan of the first two parts of this sequel and I had high expectations against the final episode as well.Without going into all the details you will face: - Ceasar who's unable to understand the concept of war - a little girl who became instant friends of the apes, no matter that she was probably raised to hate/fear the apes and the monkeys just killed his father 5 minutes ago - a supposedly high security military camp where this girl could just walk in without anybody seeing her - a supposedly high security military camp which has unguarded, not exploded pipelines underneath where anybody can simply walk in - a supposedly high security military camp with ground thick as 10in so anybody can just dig up from underneath - evil Colonel building a completely useless wall - Jar Jar Binks of the apes. Thats on its own deserves a face punch! - a train wagon full of gasoline capable to destroy the entire military base. - Ridiculous distances traveled in minutes (from sunny, probably warm beach to snowstorm) - Ceasar got an arrow shot in the final battle. Then he travels with his tribe thru deserts and lands which should take at least a year. Once they arrived to a lake they will call ""home"", Ceasar dies from the bleeding arrow shot... stupid! That would have killed him in days if not hours.and so on, and so on.These ""little"" things completely ruined the movie for me and I only stayed because my girlfriend refused to walk out. At the end she admitted that it was a mistake.","

"jadepietro","15 May 2018","GRADE: B+THE FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.JIM'S REVIEW: The Planet of the Apes series has spanned 50 years with a very spotty record of hits and misses. The third chapter in this rebooted trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes, (totaling 8 remakes, including this 2017 film) is a wonderful offering of strong storytelling, fine acting, astute direction by Matt Reeves, and dazzling state-of-the-arts visuals.The story beleaguers its tale about the battle between man and apes. After all, this is a war movie, regardless of the species, but wisely focuses on the primates and their interplay and conflicts. The film fleshes out their individual traits and humanizes their plight.Andy Serkis once again plays Caesar, the leader of the retreating apes, and supplies voice and action to his character to maximum effect. Woody Harrelson is his blood-thirsty de-humanized adversary, known as The Colonel, a direct descendent of Col. Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. He is seen as pure evil and little time is spent on his character development, one of the film's minor flaws. Also bringing strong support is Steve Zahn as Bad Ape, Karin Konoval as Caesar's loyal friend, and Amiah Miller as the mute Nova.More time is spent on the action packed combat sequences. There is strong evidence of inspiration from other war films such as The Bridge Over the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and that aforementioned Coppola classic. However, the screenplay by Mark Bomback and the director mixes the ""human"" drama with its war scenes most effectively. (Kudos to Mr. Reeves for his strong direction as well which balances the dramatic narrative with epic staging usually found in blockbuster spectacles.)But its the film's Oscar-nominated visual look that champions this sci-fi adventure film. (It should have won.) Without the transfixing motion-capture design and CGI effects created by all the artisans behind the lenses, the film would not have worked so incredibly well. It is an impressive realistic blending of animation and acting that makes the story resonant. The production values are top-notch, especially taut editing by William Hoy and Stan Salfas and a diverse music score by Michael Giacchino that does not bombard the viewer with loud unnecessary fanfare. The series is bookended with its very best efforts and War for the Planet of the Apes, this franchises' possibly last installment, ranks among its finest achievements.","

"Lewis_Heather787","17 July 2017","It is very rare for a franchise to improve with every new instalment, rise was a good start and base to launch of from. Dawn upped the stakes and consequences for both the apes and the humans, ending with a very good cliffhanger. So going into war the creators had a rather nice but pressure situation with creating this film with audience expectations. So how did the conclusion fair?Firstly lets start with the director of the film Matt Reeves, who step into the franchise when directing Dawn of the planet of the apes, which was a very good accomplishment. Once again he has triumphed with another stellar film in the franchise, improving on certain areas and keeping the core elements we love the same. He has managed to finely balance the film with great action and intense intimate scenes between main characters. The struggle between the two main stories and conflicts of the film, which both are very understandable the human side and apes. The directing compliments both the huge action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film and the journey of Caesar and the apes to find the ""human zoo"". Beautiful shots and set pieces from start to finish.Another area of the film that Reeves excels in is the screenplay of the film which also really well written, a brilliant mix of seriousness and emotion for both the apes and the humans. There is a good focus on the struggle for Caesar which is dwindling away from Dawn and his focus for revenge on the family tragedy that happens. Reeves is so good in writing family troubles and tragedies, for his next film reeves should look for a character with these elements to them....oh wait!!!! The script felt natural with good wit and charm but can easily flip to serious in places for the situations that both the humans and the apes are in. Due to this great screen writing the audience can really resonate with both sides of the story once again both for the humans and the apes struggle in the world after the simian flu. The acting in the film just like the other films is really good again and a brilliant central performance from Andy Serkis, who is complimented very well by Woody Harrelson. These are the two stars of the film however the rest of the cast are not far behind them because everyone in the film is really good it is just this two are slightly above the rest. Serkis shows a new dynamic to the character of Caesar and the journey that he has been on from the first film, he shows a damaged and aged character really well. Woody Harrelson is really good in the film as the main human voice in the film, even though he is not a nice guy you, as the audience, can understand his positioned to a certain degree. He does have some good points however his desperation and fear of death and destruction has made his delusional and is his ultimate demise. Maurice once again is the calming voice in the film for Caesar and is still a fan favourite with some really good comedy moments with bad ape. Talking of bad ape he is really good as the comedic relief in the film which is balanced really well in the film, it could have become a laughing stock and boring, however this film judged it really well. The final character to mention is the one with no lines and that is nova, she is a really good and emotional character even though she has no lines in the film, really interesting character. The CGI of the film is some of the best that has been put to screen in recent times, it is seamless and truly outstanding. It definitely deserves some recognition during awards season at the end of the year, there are times in the film where you forget that the apes and motion capture. Another area that is the final positive of the film is the score which compliments the film really well. Michael Giacchino does really well with the score complimenting the scenes in the film heightens tension when needed and can be mesmerising at times.Finally the negatives of the film, there are very few and involves the ending of the film. The ending of the film is a little obvious for the film but however I can see why they needed to do it to complete the trilogy and the story of the characters. All in all the is film is 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, A really good film, with fantastic directing and story telling with breath taking visuals it is a must see in the cinema. A great conclusion to a brilliant trilogy of films, one of the best trilogies ever.","

"swadhin999","20 July 2017","This is undoubtedly the weakest of all the 3 movies. But I believe in seeing as overall prospective. Not just the message and that regards I didn't thought it wasn't absolutely awful. In this film the role of Apes can easily be replaced any terrorist organizations in the world. Even they complaint that they are fighting for survival, for protection, society made them bla bla bla. But should we allow them to eradicate mankind? Secondly world is not so small. There is a world beyond US. So I I'm confuse. Was this movie about war between Apes verses mankind or Apes verses US. To imagine that an avalanche can destroy entire humanity is laughable. At the end I was wondering where are other humans? I was certainly expecting a showdown between Apes and Mankind. But it never happened. Overall I went in to the movie expecting 10 but returned with a 6. The good thing about the film was CGI effect. It was really goo and at no point it was over done. 3D effects were good. There were some scenes that was really intense and created tension. But overall it didn't hold onto it.Message was of the film left lots of unanswered questions.","

"BandSAboutMovies","5 January 2020","Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves wrote this installment, with Reeves returning to direct. Two years after the human-hating Koba attacked humans - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced to fight against Alpha-Omega, a military faction led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), who uses the apes loyal to Koba as his soldiers, calling them donkeys and Caesar's troops kongs.After Disney bought Fox this year, it was thought that this would be the last film in this universe. However, Wes Ball (The Maze Runner) is directing another sequel that is supposedly taking place in the same continuity.This film has way less humans in it - save the Alpha-Omega and army troops that fight one another and the mute Nova, who befriends Maurice. Steve Zahn also shows up as Bad Ape, a chimpanzee who lived in a zoo before the flu outbreak led to the apes moving up the evolutionary ladder.All the apes want to do is find a place in the desert that will be an oasis for them, so that Caesar can raise his sons Blue Eyes and Cornelius in peace. However, getting there will mean going through hell and confronting the past, where Koba had to die. It will cost him a son, a wife and nearly his own life to find the heaven on Earth that the apes deserve. If the goal was for Caesar to become the Moses of the apes, this movie certainly achieves that.After all, Maurice, an orangutan, makes the promise to tell Caesar's story to his son. In the original films, the Lawgiver is responsible for carrying on these traditions, so much so that their statue becomes revered long after Caesar has been forgotten.","

"playagario","19 July 2017","a) The most deceptive movie title there is. It tries to hype you up by adding an epic feeling, but the movie was nothing but garbage. Heck, there wasn't a war, a battle, or even combat.b) Characters we can't relate to, the portrayal of the characters was even worse.c) Can someone tell me what the purpose or meaning of this movie was? I'm having trouble finding one.d) Nothing good about this movie. No action, hardly any story line, no meaning...please don't waste time and money watching this d) I'm going to go to the zoo, film some apes jumping around, and call it ""War for the Planet of the Apes"".

"taryllsbaker","18 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Karin Konoval, Steve Zahn, Terry Notary, Ty Olson, Toby Kebbell and introducing Amiah Miller.After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. (12A cert; 140 mins)There was a Rise, there was a Dawn, now there's a War. Through each instalment of this rebooted franchise we have seen the mastery of visual effects taken to new heights. 'Rise' began the story of Caesar (Andy Serkis) with an incredible response. 'Dawn' took everything that was great and expanded upon it, both in story and in visuals. 'War' continues that leap in modern filmmaking – with Matt Reeves returning to direct – and doesn't lose what made the previous films so remarkable; the characters.What makes War for the Planet of the Apes so special, along with its predecessor, is how Reeves shows us two sides to the story. Sure, we root for the apes, but in this film we feel a sense of guilt and sadness for the humans (sometimes). The battle isn't just depicted in the film, it's in your mind. As I watch, I'm conflicted. I find myself wanting someone to call surrender, but of course this won't happen. There will be chaos. There will be death. 'War' shows it all; the riveting opening sequence prepares you for what's to come, and does so stunningly.Andy Serkis has made quite a name for himself in recent years. His role as Gollum in LOTR was of course a staple in his career, but I truly believe this franchise put him in the spotlight for many. There's no doubt he's a talented actor. He brings all the intricacies of feelings and emotion into his performance, with motion capture providing a phenomenal effect. His eyes show heartbreak, rage, love. He connects to the viewer, just as the viewer connects to him. 'War' continues his winning streak, he's truly wonderful in this film.Woody Harrelson plays the leader of the human army. He's evil, but as the film explores his reasoning, we become sympathetic. This is the stem of those conflicting thoughts, and something I love about Reeves' writing. Harrelson performs alongside Serkis very well, every scene is filled with tension, their rivalry is enthralling to watch. There's been a lot of great talent chosen for this franchise, and Harrelson is definitely one of the strongest.Surrounding the two relatable leads are a cast of superb characters, ranging from Rocket (Terry Notary), to the sweet Maurice (Karin Konoval) and the kooky but fun Bad Ape (Steve Zahn). The film also introduces Nova (Amiah Miller), a young girl saved and protected by the apes. Miller is a surprising addition to the cast and turns in a delightful performance.As I mentioned, this film is visually stunning. Michael Seresin returns as cinematographer, shooting on 65mm film, capturing every scene with impeccable skill. Each shot is carefully constructed, and the sets look beautiful. The motion capture is groundbreaking, the performances are expertly implemented into the apes and the result is seamless. The same applies to the visual and special effects; which have both developed significantly since the last instalment. A large amount of the environment is created with CGI, but it's well established and fabricated enough to be wholly convincing. The sound design also has a hand in how realistic the world is, and it's outstanding.Michael Giacchino returns to the Apes franchise with a score that evolves from his previous material, amplifying his use of percussion and woodwinds, embellishing his unique style. The opening cue is a suspenseful rise of apprehension and the reoccurring motifs perform well aside the visuals throughout. It's a terrifying, huge and atmospherical score, but there are moments of true beauty as well.'War' is an impressive film and highly entertaining. But in retrospect, I still find 'Dawn' to be the superior picture. People will expect a different kind of war, admittedly I did too, however that's not necessarily the reason I felt underwhelmed. 'War' needed some trimming; it's not butt-achingly long, but there were moments where the pacing felt a little monotonous. 'Dawn' had an equal share of action and storytelling, which made the picture a lot tighter as a whole. But 'War' is still a ride of emotions. Andy Serkis is the highlight amongst many highlights.Verdict; War for the Planet of the Apes is an engrossing, visually impressive picture and a fitting end to the Apes trilogy.War for the Planet of the Apes – ★★★★ (8/10)","

"eparazak","16 July 2017","War for the Planet of the Apes is the latest installment to the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise. It takes place about five years after Dawn. Caesar is now leading the ape tribe to war against the U.S. army up north. After an accident in his tribe, he, alongside some of his closest friends like Maurice and Rocket go on a journey to avenge said tribe. Along the way, they run into a young girl as well as an ape who would help them out on their journey.Let me just start right off the bat by saying that if you went into this movie expecting one big fight throughout the entire thing, then you'd come out disappointed. That's not how I expected the movie to be like. I expected it to be more sophisticated and interesting than just being a pure war film. Just like the previous installments in the franchise, the movie manages to rely more on characters and themes rather than pure action and I think it was handled incredibly.One of my favorite things about this movie has to be how the narrative is told. For the majority of the film, Caesar is the main focus. He's given the most amount of screen time, we see into his thoughts. The movie doesn't often cut to human characters unless Caesar appears on screen. Essentially, this is his story through his perspective. As such, the dialogue is fairly limited. As such, we learn more about how a character feels through their expressions and thoughts rather than through words. Granted, there are some exceptions of this such as when the humans would speak, but we don't necessarily get that much time with them, contrary to what you may think.In the older installments, I didn't necessarily care for some of the other apes such as Maurice. I only found them to be side characters, and admittedly, some of them do stick around as side characters. In this case, it feels like the ape tribe that was established has grown into a family that I have grown to feel for. Believe me, the movie gets emotional at many points. For example, I like Maurice now more than ever now and it's not just because of the inclusion of Nova.Like Rise and Dawn, the acting was very well done with both apes and humans. The motion capture makes the apes look like they're real apes. If the motion capture technology is put to good use like with what the people did here, the creatures made using said technology can look fantastic. I'd call this one of the best examples of how motion capture can be done correctly, even if it's a continually developing technology.If there's one thing the movie could've done without, it would have to be a comic relief. Bad Ape is introduced midway into the movie and acts as the movie's comical character. To me, this wasn't necessary as it breaks the more serious mood of the movie on multiple occasions. Either way, I didn't think he was too distracting for the most part and I did laugh at his comical moments.If you're expecting a pure war film, you'll walk out of the theater disappointed. War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the summer's best movies to date with its engaging story, well-developed characters and harsh themes.10/10","

"ijazahmadaqsa","16 July 2017","If you know the Biblical story about Moses, then that's this movie.Essentially, Caeser the ape is like the leader of an oppressed people (the Israelites). They are taken as slaves by the humans, to build a wall (Egyptians forcing Israelites to build cities). They are whipped and tortured by the humans, until a plague (surprise surprise) kills their leader (the human army Colonel).An army of humans come to the place where the apes are and are killed by an avalanche that destroys the human army (much like the Red Sea drowning the Egyptians). Then Caeser the ape leads the freed ape slaves (Israelites) across the desert...to the promised (a new) land. Before joining them, Caeser dies, as Moses died before setting foot in the promised land.All in all, it's the story of Moses, the Israelites and the Egyptians, but with apes replacing the Israelites.Lazy writing!","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","There's something special about the final film in a ""prequel trilogy"" that almost defies explanation. It acts as a springboard to the original content while also tying up all the loose ends that presented themselves in the previous installments of the trilogy. Since the source material is well-known, a viewer can deduce how it will end, but not necessarily how it will get there. In this sense, movies like Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) share a common theme as links between the new and the old.Similar in tone to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), War continues the escalating conflict between the titular apes and the now-endangered humans. Unfortunately, because it places Caesar (Andy Serkis) as the primary protagonist of the whole trilogy, the ""savior"" parallels are a little too heavy-handed here. Heck, they should have titled it Passion of the Planet of the Apes. Still, holding true to the original Planet of the Apes (1968), War almost felt like an homage to another 1960's classic as well: The Great Escape (1963).Of course, while I enjoyed this prequel trilogy and reveled in its impressive computer-generated imagery, it does produce a particular divergence from the original franchise. I haven't seen them in a while, but I'm not sure these rebooted films hold up to the plot continuity of the original ""prequel trilogy"" that was Escape (1972), Conquest (1972), and Battle (1973). Either way, War stands as an excellent end to a reboot series, replete with immediate and long-term foreshadowing that leads people to go back and watch the original Planet of the Apes.A fitting end to a pretty good prequel trilogy, I give War for the Planet of the Apes 4.0 stars out of 5.","

You literally feel no emotions for anything going on in the movie. The only feeling you get is boredom. The incoherence in the movie was unbearable . The movie tries really hard to humanize the apes to the point you feel like you are watching a day time soap opera through most of the film and not even a good one either. This movie was torture. If they need to interrogate criminals or terrorists make them watch War for the Planet of the Apes.","

"Hellmant","20 July 2017","'WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the 'PLANET OF THE APES' reboot film series. It once again stars Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of a tribe of genetically modified apes, this time leading his people in an all- out war against the humans for complete control of the planet. The film was directed by Matt Reeves (who also directed the last chapter) and it was written by Reeves and Mark Bomback (who also co-wrote 'DAWN OF THE PLANTE OF THE APES'). The film costars Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn, Amiah Miller, Karin Konoval, Ty Olsson, Judy Greer and Terry Notary. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also another big hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it too.The story picks up two years after the end of the last film, when Caesar (Serkis), and the other apes, have been at war with the humans for quite some time. Some apes, that used to follow Koba (Toby Kebbell), have joined the humans in trying to hunt down Caesar and his followers. When a crazy Colonel (Harrelson) executes Caesar's wife (Greer) and child, Caesar becomes obsessed with hunting the Colonel and his army down. A dark (and very violent) war persists.What most impressed me about the film is that it almost solely focuses on the ape characters (especially Caesar), unlike the first two movies (which had multiple central human characters in them too). Harrelson is great as the human villain, and it's funny to see a veteran vegan (of 30-years) playing the violent oppressor of animals in this movie too, but his on screen time is very limited. Serkis is the star of the movie, and the astonishing special effects, and they both magnificently deliver. Reeves' direction, and script, are also both superb. The film is an epic war movie, that definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen, and I think it's undeniable that this reboot series is far superior to the original franchise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Mg3uG2FLNSE","

"benhrkach","9 September 2017","If you walked up to a random person on the street and told them that there was a movie called War for the Planet of the Apes, they might assume that a movie with that title can't be all that great. Well, guess what? It can be. It absolutely can be and I was floored with this film.The performances, the visual effects (which will win the Oscar in early 2018), the story and the cinematography were all so incredible. This film feels and looks real, despite the fact that it's about a group of CGI apes just trying to survive. Each scene was riveting to watch and each one perfectly led into the next one. While many have complained that the title is misleading, it's actually not. There is a war going on between humans and apes and there is a inner war going on in Caesar's mind. It may not be displayed the way that some people wanted it to be, but that's okay. It's still such a beautiful spectacle. Watch the fantastic conclusion to one of the better trilogies in recent years!Grade: 8.4/10","

"ruskin-462-304151","23 August 2017","I see a lot of so-so movies but this one is genuinely awful. The only thing good about it is that now I know not to trust Rotten Tomatoes which gave it an aggregate of 93% which is dumbfounding. There is no way to begin to count the ways that this movie sucked. Too long, stupid stupid impossible situations with no attempt at explaining how these preposterous events could actually happen. And on top of that dripping with syrupy sentimentality (Apes with sweet, no sad, but caring tears in their eyes)... And on top of all that the effects were not as good as the first movie which I was astounded by. The movement was just off (watch the rock hefting scenes more carefully; the rocks clearly weighed about 2 ounces each).Sure, I already suspended my disbelief that we got talking apes taking over the planet, and yes I loved ALL of the original 5 movies for their camp and charm.

"drael64","22 July 2017","In an age where everything human is neutered through the lense of political correctness, the apes series represents a bold, primal honesty, where neither humans nor apes are good nor bad and everything is on display, and not hidden in pretence. Its an exploration of morality, and the war between that and the primal emotions of hate, sadness, and fear that broil inside us, brilliantly brought to life by the animal-human hybrid of emotions acted through our protagonists the apes. In this movie we follow caeser and his tribe, in a quest for revenge, rescue and to avoid a war.This plot is not specifically about ""a war"", but rather a battle in the context of a greater war - so while there is action, like the other ape movies there is a lot more going on than just boringly consistent bang, boom, woosh. In particular there are dramatic moments, that speak to the human condition, and the inner battles we face in life.This movie brings a very welcome touch of comic relief which lightens the mood to the series, and also a little innocent love and hope - so you won't walk away feeling jaded either. Moving, exciting, and brilliantly executed.","

"tankace","20 July 2017","Having now watch and the newest film of this series I will start reviewing in a reverse chronological order very movie from the Planet of the Apes series up until the original. Now to our film we follow our tribe of apes as they are in conflict with the human due to the events of the previous film and their leader Ceasar as he fights to keep his family (both actual and more broadly speaking his tribe) and after the soldiers try to invade in his home he goes on his personal journey for revenge. What I love with this film is how real is the drama for this group ,which we now follow for six years in films and we have seeing to becoming a proper society. Also the effects are spectacular and at times you forget the these creatures aren't real but actors and actresses in tight costumes! The best of them is of course Ceasar who now is a grizzled leader and he is willing to do everything in his power to protect his family and if he fails avenge it with extreme prejudice. And this single mind approach is mention by his close friend Maurice ,the best Orangutan in film history, that is very similar with that of Kompa ,the chimpanzee who is partly responsible for this conflict.As for the humans, we don't get a lot of them, this a very ape-central movie(but we humans aren't also apes so again the previous films were ape-central...whatever). However their reason to continue this fight is revealed later and it makes sense for them to try their best to exterminate the apes. Also the main antagonist played expertly by Woody Harrelson is the kind of person that is willing to do anything to in his mind prevent apes form replacing humans as the dominate species. So his actions and words though show that he is of his rockets, they at least make him a believable person in that post- apocalyptic environment.Side note here if Andy Serkis doesn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance here I will go bananas on the committee. Sorry I had to write that for I don't understand why he hasn't an Oscar yet for his work in both her and the Lord of the Rings.As for cinematography ,pase and action great and beautiful just that I have nothing else to say truly the creating team has put a lot of work in this project. One thing that shows this attention to details is who the apes communicate with out actually speaking using just body language and sign language.Over all a great film and if the series ends here I will be satisfied and Apes Together Strong.","

"room102","27 July 2017","* I put a spoilers warning although I don't think that any of them actually spoils the movie *Let's start with the good stuff: The CGI. Absolutely incredible. Technology has reached a level you simply can't trust what you see anymore. The apes rendering is just flawless and it's done in nearly every frame of the movie. It's only the movement that seems slightly off at times. It's worth seeing this movie at the cinema just to appreciate the level of achievement of the CGI on the big screen. IMO it deserves an Oscar for visual effects.I liked this sequel better than the previous one. It's not as good as the first in the new trilogy, but it's surprisingly dramatic and emotional. While there's plenty of action, those scenes are there to serve the plot and dramatic parts, not just action for the sake of action.Having said that, the movie is not without its shortcoming. First of all, like all blockbusters nowadays - it's way too long. It should have been 20-30 min shorter. The plot itself, like I said above, is quite emotional and dramatic at times but something is missing for me, the story is quite simple and missing some more elements.There are plenty of references to the original 1968 movie and - like in Rogue One - an attempt to explain some elements seen in the original movie (especially why the humans can't talk) and perhaps tying the end of this movie to the beginning of the original movie (although the latter takes place in a much further future).Also, there are plenty of references to APOCALYPSE NOW.All the actors are very good in their roles: Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn (Bad Ape), Amiah Miller (the girl) and Karin Konoval (Maurice).All in all it's a pretty good movie.Worth watching",NA
"criticadelcinema","19 July 2017","Man, I can always tell if a series is great if I get that empty feeling when it comes to a close. With that being said—this is one of the most gripping, emotional films I've seen all year, serving as a fitting bookend for Mark Reeves' outstanding series of Apes movies. This is a bit of an unorthodox ending to a trilogy. Instead of aiming for the overblown action spectacle that usually close these things out, War for delivers a deeply moving, character driven story. That might turn some viewers off from the film, especially because the marketing behind this movie—and even the title—creates certain expectations. While this could be disappointing, the film is so effective on an emotional level that you can forgive it for it's lack of constant action. War for definitely benefits from the two previous films when it comes to character development, specifically the development of protagonist Caesar. Caesar is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters ever put to film. We have seen him go from orphaned infant, to budding revolutionary, to thoughtful leader, and now; extremely weary general. This slow buildup of character depth makes the completion of his arc truly captivating. When tragedy strikes, you care. When good favor comes his way, you care. If we talk about Caesar, we have to talk about the man behind the ape. Andy Serkis has done a marvelous job portraying every stage of Caesar's life through motion capture in these films, and his performance is just as amazing here. It would be a tragedy if Serkis doesn't at the very least get a Oscar nomination for his performance here. The emotion that is conveyed through the eyes and voice of Serkis' performance is far superior than most ""real human"" acting performances this year. If Serkis deserves an Oscar for his performance, than the visual effects team definitely deserves one as well. The CGI of the apes is simply flawless. Director Matt Reeves makes a point of shooting the apes close up, really putting the outstanding work this effects team did on showcase.Not only is this the most visually polished film of the trilogy, this is the most beautifully shot film I've seen all year. From beginning to end, Reeves puts together poignant sequences that rely almost exclusively on visuals. There are many historic visual allusions here, ranging from shots reminiscent of the Trail of Tears to Holocaust symbolism. The allegory presented combined with the emotional investment in these characters, creates some truly heart- wrenching moments. One element that I thought didn't work as well in the previous movies were the human characters. Woody Harrelson flips this trend on it's head with an excellent performance here as the Colonel. Not only is the Colonel the most villainous human character of the series, he is the most complex human character of this trilogy. I can talk on and on about how much I love this movie, but instead I'll let the stars speak for themselves. Just go see this.War for the Planet of the Apes pulls absolutely no punches, delivering a powerful conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies ever made. All aboard the Andy Serkis Oscar train.",NA

You are thrown right into it. It is built up like a Vietnam war film just that it is between humans and their creations. The animation gets better with each film and I think in this part it is just as good as it could get. Awesome and absolutely photo realistic. But beyond all that great Motion Capture is Andy Serkis' performance. He gave his best performance of the entire Ape trilogy. And if his role was a human without any CGI this would be a shoe in for Best Actor at the Oscars. Tremendous work, so many emotions, so real. Also it is character development at its best. I hope the Academy opens up for performances like that. As good as Woody Harrelson was, especially during his big scene, he never came close to the work of Andy Serkis. Also Steve Zahn gives a very good motion capture performance and Amiah Miller was very charismatic. The cinematography was amazing and so was the score. I think the only little, but really very little flaw was the pace. I mean it was extremely excited and quite twisted but somehow I missed the developments outside of Ceasar. Of course the focus was on him but I really hoped they would go more beyond that. Also the Christian and Nazi metaphors felt a bit drawn out. But those are just minor flaws and the only reason why I liked the first two films slightly better. Still it is possibly the best summer blockbuster of the year.",NA
"matthewssilverhammer","20 July 2017","After the slow-burn drama of Rise and the dystopian adventure of Dawn, War is a sci-fi-war-western for the ages. With a world even more segregated, the ape community seeks justice with a new foe, but there's more to this than just pure vengeance. This continues the empathetic story of Caesar, who, when his heart breaks, so does ours; and who, when his blood boils, so does ours. Technically, it's staggering. Reeves has crafted War like a perfectly melancholic song, knowing just when to throw in a major chord or tonal uplift (the delightful new ape) to counterbalance without abandoning the soulful heartache. The CG is impossibly amazing, and the action sequences and scenic shots are so far beyond the norm for a Hollywood spectacle; full of artistic intent and skill, it's more comparable to a John Ford film than a modern superhero outing. And the score is beyond phenomenal. Haunting, sweet, intense; it beautifully plays with the same tones, themes and instruments as the experimental score for the groundbreaking '60s original. At its heart, War is refreshingly thoughtful. Delusions of grandeur, fearing the ""other"", conspiracy theories, slavery, suicide, nature wiping out humanity; this franchise is no stranger to the heavier points of storytelling. Thankfully, such intense empathy has been created for Caesar and his simian brethren in this unexpectedly poignant and fantastic franchise, that we allow (and even long) for its intense honesty. And look, there's a straight-up glut of great stuff in theatres. If you want some light fun full of mirth and mayhem, by all means, see Spider-Man. However, if you wanna be dramatically immersed in a world of emotive power and visual depth, see War.",NA
"amichnea","14 October 2017","I loved the first two films, Rise and Dawn, however this film had no story whatsoever. Why is it called War for the Planet of the Apes? The first film had a lot more action than this one, the second one had 100 times more action than this one.Pretty insulting that it took them three years to follow Dawn and they gave us absolutely nothing. Just a very basic extension of the Dawn which could have been summed up in about 30 minutes max.I was falling asleep, my wife fell asleep half way, I did not see the need to give her a bump so she wakes up as there was nothing to see. At the end I almost jumped up and though wait, this is going to be good, there is an army of Monkeys coming down fighting for supremacy, this will make complete sense for the next film... (almost felt like the whole non existent plot and BS was worth the 2 hours wait)... but I guess it was just me falling asleep trying to make the film more exciting. No Ape army, no Ape action, no Ape of anything... plenty of Ape Drama though.I could sum up this whole film in 2 3 words but can't give any spoilers.Sure the Ape CGI is amazing as are the emotions from the Apes, Bad Ape was great but everything else was a huge MEH. They should have just called it ""Drama of the Planet of the Apes"", or ""What happens to monkeys whilst war breaks out around them"", you could easily see that on the History Channel or even today in different parts of the world.I was expecting so much more, considering the first and second films. What a huge disappointment.The film is beautiful, don't get me wrong... for Drama students, an Oscar nomination or something you would expect at a films festival where it would get 100 different awards but none for the story. At this rate we are going to see another 5 or 10 films before we get to the Ape society which the originals were showing.In the first and second films I actually did not know who I would sympathise with.I guess we could go via this route: Humans Very Bad, Apes Good, Humans Bad, Apes Good, Apes Bad, Humans mostly Good, Apes Good, Human Very Bad, Apes Very Good, Human Very Very Bad, Apes still Good. Going forward we will need: Apes Good, Humans Good, Apes Bad, Humans Good, Apes Very Very Bad, Humans Very Very Good, Apes Good and Humans Good everyone happy.",NA
"uklb51","16 July 2017","This has been the first time I've been compelled to write an IMDb review. This movie should have about 6 stars and hopefully will before all is done. There is very little war with the Humans, the actual fight scenes are full of glaring plot holes. Apparently our army cannot locate and fight a bunch of tribal apes despite having access to all the technology you would expect. I really wanted to see a more evolved Ape civilization, but they are almost taken backwards to create sympathy. This leaves the movie being a more political movie.I should have watched Spiderman this weekend.",NA
"drapga","26 May 2018","There have been so many tedious by the numbers Hollywood films over the last 20 odd years that I sat down to watch this film in fear of wasting 2 hours of my life. 25 mins into the story I grabbed a glass of whiskey and settled down to watch a thoroughly enjoyable film. An interesting choice of scenery and location, no colour tinting to make up for bad cinematography, believable effects, a story, no mind-numbing fast editing to make you think you're watching something hip, good acting, humour, tradegy. 4 whiskies later i'm writing this. The original Charlton Heston Planet of the Apes is unbeatable. As a sci-fi fan I recommend this film as an interesting add -on to the series, better than some of the remakes. Cheers.",NA
"dhavaljiya","27 September 2018","Writing was weak .this was a missed opportunity I was looking for an epic finale to this film series but instead we got this .it's fine I guess .it should have been awesome but it was only ok",NA
"sachaks-05547","13 July 2017","I found this disappointing as i though this would be a lot better.It turned out very slow ,lack of action which the title portrays.Acting was good.Ceaser was brooding most of the time. I was awaiting for the big battle between apes and humans but this seems to be in the beginning.The first 2 were far better.A disappointed ending to the trio of films",NA
"Ultra_Collectibles","27 June 2018","Very very slow paced movie. No dialogue for many of the scenes so they just drag! Woody Harrelson's character was evil for a stupid reason. I really dont know why they kept fighting. I had too stop watching it when there was like ten minutes left. Cut out the slow paced no dialogue parts and I think the movie would cut down to about 1 hour and 45 minutes. AVOID!",NA
"aheaven2005","30 January 2021","I had like the first two so much that I was full of hope for this one. Sadly after a good start the film slows down to a halt during the middle act. I loved the few nods to the original movies, but that's pretty much it. Oh and the sound design in Atmos was tremendous.",NA
