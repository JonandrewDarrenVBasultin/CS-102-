"Sleepin_Dragon","7 August 2021","It's a shame that I didn't see this at the cinema, I can only imagine what a treat for the senses this was on the big screen. A visual masterpiece, and an intoxicating story of belief and friendship.You must give so much credit to the team that produced this, not a book I would have thought easy to adapt, as it is so vague, the realisation is of course breathtaking, I absolutely loved it.I've read comments about those that wanted action and dramatic scenes, this film isn't about the destination, it's about the journey.Breathtaking, 9/10.","

"JohnDeSando","21 November 2012","''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat."" From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger ""Richard Parker"" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,"" says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat.","

"Leofwine_draca","11 May 2014","When I heard that the film adaptation of LIFE OF PI was being released, I made sure to go and read the novel beforehand so I could compare it to the movie. I'm not a huge fan of Ang Lee and his overrated CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this. But I needn't have worried; this is a great movie, a film that fully explores the splendour of cinema and on-screen storytelling, and a film that's better than the book.The early and, quite frankly, boring parts of the novel are summarised well so that the storytelling is always on the move. The focus is on the survival narrative, which is as it should be, and the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker is brought to vivid and moving life. Sure, there are the occasional mis-steps along the way, like an ill-advised and tacked-on romance, but for the most part they get it right. The CGI is wondrous, especially the animals and an eye-popping shipwreck, and the story is moving, tender in places and full of heart. I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes in parts, and it's all down to Richard Parker, who must go down as one of the great animal characters in cinema. A great example of filming the unfilmable.","

"Davor_Blazevic_1959","3 January 2013","With his latest movie, ""Life of Pi"", Ang Lee further establishes himself as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors. Starting from his Taiwanese beginnings, and his highly enjoyable, family-harmonizing ""Father Knows Best"" trilogy (1992-1994), through his Academy Award winning works on gracefully choreographed, highly spiritualized Far East martial arts tour de force ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000, best foreign-language film) and on an uncommon yet nostalgic portrayal of the Old West in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005, best director), to his other titles like ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995), ""The Ice Storm"" (1997), and ""Lust, Caution"" (2007), quality and Kubrick-like versatility shown in his movies offer continuous attraction for wide audience of his admirers.Lee's latest and, so far, easily, greatest movie, ""Life of Pi"" is based on a screenplay adapted from the acclaimed fictional adventure novel written by Canadian author Yann Martel.Throughout his childhood, due to matching pronunciation of French word ""piscine"" (pool, swimming pool) and English word ""pissing"", Piscine Molitor Patel, named that way after later abandoned Parisian swimming pool, so predictably suffers from being nicknamed ""Pissing Patel"". In order to avoid it, once in high school he finally shortens his name to Pi Patel... Nowadays middle-aged Pi tells the story of his life to a visiting writer, apparently a book author Yan Martel's alter ego, who is seeking for the literal inspiration. Retrospectively, Pi divides his childhood and adolescence into three segments. In the first segment he gives shorter account of his life until the age of 16, describing his interaction with his family and schoolmates, in particular his relationship with his father and a girlfriend, concentrating on his exploits of God and spirituality, meandering between multitude of religious practices while in the last one he briefs about his testimonial given to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, investigating the reasons why the ship his family was relocating on from India to Canada sank. Most detailed, and therefore the longest, is recollection of his 227 days in a lifeboat, an extraordinary ordeal he went through after the ship has capsized and everybody else, crew and passengers, died Well, everybody human, but not everybody living. Namely, a number of terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo, offered for sale and brought along with other family belongings, have survived, too. But, not for long, because, while confined in the most limited space as they were, surrounded by vastness of the ocean, the law of the ""survival of the fittest"" prevails, takes its tall, and pretty soon Pi finds himself in a company of a single one topping the food-chain, a Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker. Not to reveal the story further, it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories: in an engaging tale—whether allegory or depiction of realistic, believable events, filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity, imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts, encouraging the same in viewers—of an uncommon character, indeed, brought to on-screen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads, remarkably presented via ubiquitous, yet inconspicuous animation, exceptional, CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography, all along complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, complex yet basic, difficult yet simple, initially charged with Pi's dreadful fear, swiftly shifting to respectful care, instantly boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive survival techniques 16-year old Pi uses—amply benefiting from his instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son, certainly well acquainted with animal psychology—to suppress the fear and convincingly impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate ""killing machines"" among mammals, desperately striving for his own survival, nevertheless, generously, for survival of his seemingly sufficiently tamed companion, but still, initially and ultimately, magnificent adversary, Richard Parker, as well.""Life of Pi"" is, certainly, one of the most impressive movies of 2012, year that has just come to a close.","

"damh_frikinlater","21 November 2012","The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.But if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.If you think that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make ""Tron: Legacy"" looks so cool and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year.","

"StevePulaski","22 November 2012","Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name ""Pi Patel,"" and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long life-story to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pi's father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named ""Richard Parker"" on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original two-hour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dear-life, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) I've ever sat through in a theater.Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the back-and-forth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pi's, of joy and sadness. This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true game-changers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, you'd think Christopher Nolan's modern-day Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and on-par with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful.","

"cnitinb","22 November 2012","Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'? But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!","

"Michael_Elliott","26 November 2012","Life of Pi (2012) **** (out of 4) Ang Lee's incredible tale of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), a teenage Indian boy who survives a ship sinking that kills everyone on board except for himself and a tiger. Soon the two are on board a lifeboat not knowing what their future holds. I had never heard of the novel that this film is based on and I had absolutely no idea what the film was about until about five months prior I saw a promotional piece while waiting to watch another movie. I actually went back to work joking about the picture because I couldn't believe anyone would try and make a movie about a boy, a tiger and a lifeboat but the joke is on me because Lee has created one of the more memorable, magical and uplifting films of the year. I was really shocked to see how tremendous the picture was but what makes it so special would have me giving away countless spoilers, which is something I'm certainly not going to do. I think it would be best for viewers to go into the picture knowing as little as possible but I can say that Lee has created one of the most beautiful pictures you're likely to see. The beautiful images are just so remarkable to look at that it's impossible not to get caught up in the scenery. Be it the early stuff in India or the breathtaking moments at sea, everything in this picture just lights up the screen. I'm really not a fan of CGI unless it's used properly. Too many times I think it's just used to be lazy and save money but that's not the case here as Lee perfectly mixes in the CGI with the live action stuff. The two coming together are practically flawless and that certainly helps bring one closer to the story and characters. Sharma does a terrific job and especially when you consider he'd never acted before and was basically having to carry the entire film. I was a little mixed on the 3D effects. While some where brilliant, for the most part I think the film would be viewed just fine in 2D as it would give one better colors. Still, no matter which version you see, the heart of the picture is in its soul, its character and the lessons he learns while being stuck out at sea for over two hundred days. LIFE OF PI is a really remarkable film that has so much going for it that it's clearly one of the year's best.","

"planktonrules","11 April 2013","By the time I got to see this film, the Oscars were long past and there already were a ton of reviews for ""Life of Pi"". On top of that, I have noticed that for big pictures which most everyone likes, I rarely have much to say. After all, I agree with the majority--""Life of Pi"" is a very good film. So, my review will be brief.THE reason to watch this film is pretty simple: You cannot say that the movie reminds you of anything you've ever seen before or since. Sure, you could try comparing ""Life of Pi"" to ""Avatar""--but that is only because they both used gobs of CGI to create fantastic stories. But the story itself, is so original. In addition, the acting, direction and artistry of the movie is tops. While I would agree with the Oscar folks that ""Argo"" was a better film, it wasn't by much. Well worth your time.","

"noah_eye","13 November 2012","I was lucky enough to see Pi in full 3D Imax at a pre-viewing in San Diego last night, and as a huge fan of the book, I was intensely satisfied.Believe it or not, I was more impressed with the the casting choices and performances of the players than by the effects. Granted, the movie was very beautiful, but in the end, Life Of Pi was more character driven than anything. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add, as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis, the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story. I would recommend seeing Pi in 3D, but I don't think that's it's essential to your viewing enjoyment. The 3D just takes a beautiful film and makes it a little bit nicer. Also, if you've read the book and are concerned that the story you loved may have been compromised in anyway, worry no longer. This is easily, one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.Happy viewing folks. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. I'll be seeing it again in theaters very soon.","

Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is woven so tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee, not only was he able to capture the beauty of India, he was also able to get the best of the actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D, its just visually mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the movie for the next few days!","

"mithil293","22 November 2012","According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book of same title.Piscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn't go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??","

"ClaytonDavis","28 September 2012","There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of ""Pi,"" a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with ""movie stars."" Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it.Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)","

"ElMaruecan82","26 March 2017","Every once in a while, a movie keeps you marveling at the beauty of its imagery while captivating your mind with its intellectual richness, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is such a movie where images speak a thousand words, so is ""Life of Pi"" with a difference though: it is pretty vocal about its content. To a certain degree, the film embodies the number 'Pi' whose mathematical function and simple writing are only the tip of an iceberg of infinite immensity.Still, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a delight for the eyes before the mind, a stunt even more impressive as 2012 eyes used to think they saw it all (3 years after ""Avatar"" and less than a decade after Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings""). Some shots reminded me of that line from ""Forrest Gump"" who was running across a desert and the morning light cast such a glow that he couldn't tell where Heaven stopped and the Earth began. And ""Life of Pi"" is fertile in such shots where you can't tell the limits between the sky and the water, and it is no coincidence that the story is a metaphysical quest à la Paolo Coelho, of a boy drifting across the Pacific Ocean with a tiger, of all the companions.God is obviously the 'guy-up-there' incarnated by the skies and the stars and Pi addresses him many times by raising his head, but when the sky and the water seems to make one, which might imply that Pi can find God, or try to, by looking at the ocean or in the eye of his feline companion of misfortune. Pi was named after Piscine Molitor which was the most beautiful swimming pool his uncle ever swam in, and in the scene showing the Parisian pool, the water is so clear, the man feels like floating in the air, it is not just gratuitous effects but the display of a heavenly, ecstatic moment, where the body and the mind are in total symbiosis. This is how the uncle found God anyway.To avoid the mockeries, Piscine calls himself 'Pi' and is so motivated that he becomes a champion of the Pi number and could memorize thousands of the decimal pieces, the cheers of his comrades making up for years of urological nicknames. But don't get mislead, the film is only about mathematics if you use the Galilean metaphor of the alphabet with which God wrote the universe. This is a language Pi is eager to decrypt, driven by his childlike curiosity, Hindu myths and Gods fascinate him, so does the story of Jesus Christ who died as an innocent for all the humans' sins, and he also finds peace and serenity while recalling the name of Allah during his prayers. Pi's ecumenical openness inevitably crashes into his father's rationality.""Appa"", a zoo owner, is a practical man who doesn't believe in religion, he eats meat and would rather have a son sticking to strong opinions rather than believing in everything, being as ""irrational"" and unlimited as the like-named number. So, it's the father who puts limits in his son's idealism where he sees him trying to feed the tiger (named Richard Parker), believing animals have soul. The father proves him wrong by tying a goat to the cage and showing him how the animals deal together. Animals have no souls, it is only the reflect of humans' soul, the metaphor for religion is obvious. We only see God through our own eyes, how ironic though that the father uses a sacrifice of such heavy religious undertones to make his point. As for Pi, the matters of God are forgotten for a time.And it takes that extraordinary journey where he's stuck with the tiger and has to learn how to tame it, to feed it so it doesn't think of eating him, to state his presence, mark his territory, to establish a way to communicate with the animal, until finally, Pi concludes his metaphysical quest. The tiger becomes his enemy but also his ticket for life. I won't spoil right now how the adventure connects with God, but it is all done in that conclusive last rhetorical question, where Pi creates his own myth, which like all myths, explains a fact through a story that might sound ludicrous but whose universal appeal is undeniable. Because that's what myths are: stories that go beyond our own perceptions, that seems impossible yet challenge our thinking to such a point that their nonexistence seems as unbelievable as the opposite.While I was watching the film, I was mesmerized by the special effects, the interactions between Pi and the tiger, even with the other animals. And I was almost disappointed to learn it was CGI, it didn't look like CGI to me, for some reason, it felt ""plausible"", too beautiful to be artificial. But maybe that is the ground broken by Ang Lee. In 1914, a man shared a screen with a dinosaur, in 1964 one danced with penguins, in 1988, one was handcuffed to a rabbit, in 1993, dinosaurs came back in the form of CGI creatures, their realness was undeniable but it still asked for our suspension of disbelief. ""Life of Pi"" is the only one where the animals are meant to be and look real, that the magic of the film would take a 'normal form' to better fool us.Some would say that God was a creation by humans but maybe the idea of God is so beautiful that humans only tries to make it approachable, like God who used the figure of Jesus, or Muslims when they pray or Hindus with all their Gods. Maybe less than the form of God, is the idea itself, maybe Cinema is like religion or myths, after all, it is all about suspension of disbelief, but for a purpose that is essential to the human soul.","

"killercharm","7 April 2022","Exquisite tale of a tiger and a boy lost at sea together in a lifeboat. They are survivors of a ship that is wrecked at sea; it was carrying his family and their zoo animals. The shipwreck is impeccably filmed and presented; it looks wildly realistic. The same is true for the entire time they spend onboard their lifeboat. This story of the boy and the tiger and their adventures is emotionally told and it tears right into your heart.","

"cultfilmfan","25 November 2012","I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book, but have read Beatrice and Virgil, which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi, was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know, I am not a fan of 3D, or basically even in seeing films in 3D, but to me, Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology, or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening, or perhaps ugly, but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot, so I do not spoil it for other viewers, but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character, Pi, he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times, that he does not quit, or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself, but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times, he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging, or difficult times, but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives, but on the same thought, I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs, alcohol, or sex, but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming, but through all of those trials, I have been able to rely on God, and while often in those situations I felt anxious, or like giving up myself, I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough, or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No, going through it was not always easy, or fun, but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction, or some type of sin that while it may not seem so, is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy, or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier, healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin, addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him, give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days, weeks, or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand, but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes, ears, senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about, but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement, but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it, but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover, or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films.","

"chera_khalid","20 September 2023","""Life of Pi"" is a visually stunning and imaginative cinematic journey that earns its 6/10 rating through its strengths and a few noticeable weaknesses. The film's strength lies in its breathtaking cinematography and groundbreaking visual effects, which bring the remarkable story to life with unparalleled beauty and wonder. Suraj Sharma's performance as Pi is commendable, considering the challenging role he undertakes. The score by Mychael Danna enhances the emotional depth of the narrative, although some might find it a bit overpowering at times. While the film's symbolism and philosophical themes resonate with some viewers, others may find them somewhat heavy-handed, affecting the overall impact of this otherwise visually captivating and thought-provoking tale.","

"Zachary_Butler","21 November 2012","Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast, you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too. 9/10. Worth it.","

"evanston_dad","15 February 2013","I read ""Life of Pi"" years ago and remembered little of the details about the book other than that I enjoyed it. During the first half hour or so of Ang Lee's screen adaptation, I felt myself getting bored and restless. It seemed like a religious movie, a movie whose central premise was all about reaffirming a belief in God. As a non-believer, I don't begrudge films with religious themes, but I also don't really enjoy them, feeling like someone invited to a party where everyone else is speaking a different language.But then the main thrust of the story kicks in, the young boy Pi is stranded in the middle of the ocean with a lifeboat and a tiger, and I was engrossed by the beauty and spectacle that Ang Lee delivers. And then toward the end, there's a twist that I instantly remembered from the book as soon as it happens in the film, and that I can't believe I had forgotten. For that twist is what makes this film something beautiful and much more than a simple story about faith in a higher power. Instead, it becomes a story that gets much closer to the motives behind what I think drives most people to religious faith, and that is that believing in God is way more comforting than the alternative. Some people seem to be able to choose to believe, while others (like myself) simply can't, no matter how much more appealing life seems with a strong belief in a higher power. People will argue probably forever over this film's ending and what it means, but that's what it meant for me.Ang Lee needs to be commended. This film had to be a very difficult directing feat to pull off, confined as it is almost entirely to a lifeboat and a slew of CGI effects.A truly wondrous and wonderful film.Grade: A","

"Meven_Stoffat","1 December 2012","Let's be honest here: Life of Pi is a pretty looking movie with a rather dismal plot, and a pretentious religious subtext thrown in there for good measure.Life of Pi might not be a bad movie. Realistically it would get maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10, but seeing as there's so many positive reviews here and all of them seem to be from either fanboys of the book, or people who haven't seen very many movies at all, I figured a 1 would be best to balance things out.No doubt the film has some humorous moments that are indeed very funny, like the tiger peeing in Pi's face, Pi's ""rules"", and what not, and the film has tons of pretty visuals. A lot of the film takes place on a boat, and at times it looks like they used a real ocean to film it on. Not to mention the jellyfish scene was pretty, it was almost like James Cameron's Avatar. But... the plot is just so vapid and pretentious, it defies description. Basically, the film throws around a lot of religious references, and it takes up a good portion of the plot, but dear LORD most of the time, the religious references were as subtle as bricks in a drying machine. At times it's like the writers are smacking you across the face with a bible. And when he father asked Pi (as a child) early in the film ""how many more religions are you going to convert to?"" (or something like that), I should have taken that as an indication as how the rest of the movie would be.Oh and the many random moments which included (but weren't limited to): the strange 2:35.1 Aspect ratio change where suddenly a bunch of fish start flying out of the water into the boat (including WINGED fish that seemed like a Michael Bay wet dream), a carnivorous island full of meerkats (though to be fair, the meerkats scene was like a cuteness overdose), and humpback whale bit. Yeah. There were parts of the film I enjoyed, but it honestly was just not a very good movie. It was like eating a platter full of candy and sugary sweets. Lots to indulge in and munch down on, but you've devoured nothing of substance by the end, and you're left with a stomach ache. And throwing a religious subtext in it doesn't mean the film is good or anything... It's just pretentious.So yeah, like I said. Realistically my rating would be a 4 or 5 out of 10, but the 8.4 rating and amounts of 10/10 reviews here is just ridiculous.","

"Robert_duder","23 November 2012","The trailers I saw for Life of Pi did nothing to explain what the movie was at all and I had not read the book nor heard of it. But I decided to give it a try. I don't like 3D, never have, it's always unimpressive. Well guess what? Ang Lee did it. I saw this in 3D and it literally is the first 3D film that made me go WOW!! The visuals are just absolutely amazing, some of the best effects I have ever seen. Fortunately this is not where the films ends it impressive streak. The story is just lovely, riveting, and so emotionally and spiritually deep. A philosophy class could talk about this movie for an entire year and still have more to say. The film doesn't even begin to try to give you a philosophy or way of life but rather is all about exploring the world and exploring the philosophies of life. As a lover of animals you will look for how all the animals in the film play a role but there are truly just animals and important lessons are learned through them. It was perhaps one of the most symbolic and deeply philosophical films I have ever seen and because of that it was incredibly entertaining and beautifully shot.While a few actors play Pi throughout various stages of his life, only one leaves an indelible and brilliant impression. Suraj Sharma at least deserves an Oscar nomination for making you feel so connected to him and displaying a brilliant display of courage and depth to his character. While he doesn't get as much screen time Irrfan Khan puts incredible emotion into his performance as adult Pi. Both Sharma and Khan bring to life a great adventurer and philosopher in the form of Pi. The supporting cast performs their parts perfectly. No one person really stands out because their goal it to get Pi into his adventure but they are still great. Adil Hussain and and Tabu are particularly good as Pi's parents.Ang Lee without a doubt must receive an Oscar nod for this film. The cinematography, the special effects, and most importantly the use of those special effects are nothing short of revolutionary. The animals are so brilliantly done and the character of the tiger (Richard Parker...love how he got his name too) is so vital to the entire story and by the time the film ends you will ache for the tiger as much as Pi does so you will feel his emotions. The film won't be for everyone. Certainly its just too intense for children with a lot of animal deaths and I can see the mainstream movie goers accusing it of being ""slow"" or ""boring"" but for anyone looking for something unique and outstanding, Life of Pi is it. I hope the critics feel the same way because this one is a home run in my books!! 9/10","

"3xHCCH","9 January 2013","I have just finished reading the book the other day, and today I got to watch the film version. With the book still so fresh in my head, I went into the cinema with very high expectations. This is specially so after reading and hearing reviews which call Ang Lee's cinematic masterpiece visually comparable to ""Avatar"" or emotionally comparable to ""The Little Prince,"" as well as all of the awards buzz.The book for me was a pleasant though slow read because of the lengthy wordy, even flowery, descriptions Yann Martel uses for his languid reflection on zoo life, his comparative study of Hindu, Christian and Moslem philosophy, and of course, his survival tale at sea by a teenager and a Bengal tiger sharing one lifeboat. It waxes philosophical in the beginning, then waxes fantastical in the middle, before settling for dry reality at the end. While a movie could probably improve on the imagery for each scene, there are several key parts of the novel that would entail a lot of narration. On the big screen, too much narration cannot be too good.My first assumption turned out to be true. The cinematography and visual effects were expectedly first rate and excellent. Those camera angles were breathtaking. The colors were very vibrant. The special effects regarding animals were realistic for the most part, especially the land mammals, particularly Richard Parker. Though I have to say that the water creatures were too obviously computer-generated, not too good. A most triumphant sequence in the film for me were the scenes on the floating green island of algae and meerkats. I thought that was ideally visualized and executed, so much better than that chapter of the book.My second assumptions also turned out true. A lot of the story needed to be narrated by an adult Pi Patel as he was being interviewed by a novelist researching for his next book. These bookending present day scenes were pretty dry for me. The whole last chapter of the book when Pi was interviewed by the Japanese shipping officials was all one long narration only without supporting imagery. All of this talky narration may be boring for some people. In order to make the film appeal to more people, Ang Lee spares us from gory details which the book was not averse to describing in graphic detail. In the film, the screen time of the zebra, orangutan and hyena was very short. For all the brutality that was supposed to have happened on board, Ang's lifeboat remains almost pristine white. I thought that was quite merciful of Ang. I wish I could also say the same for some sappy melodramatic scenes, like Richard Parker laying his head on Pi's lap, which were not in the book.Overall, this film version of ""Life of Pi"" is very good, but it can be disappointing for people who have read the book. It was a loyal albeit sanitized version of the book, which is not really a bad thing. The book was not exactly inspirational to me, more educational actually. For this film, Ang Lee seemingly aspired to make this movie inspirational, and these obvious efforts may prove to backfire for some audiences.","

"Galina_movie_fan","22 February 2013","I saw ""Life of Pi"" last night and absolutely loved it. I still feel so overwhelmed by it, its visual splendor and the moving story that kept me involved for the whole time. The latest Ang Lee's film is beauty itself, and everyone involved in creation of such sparkling intelligent and classy entertainment deserves the highest praise and admiration for the work they've done. I am sure that in two days, ""Life of Pi"" will receive majority of Oscars it is nominated for. It deserves them.I hesitated to see it because I did not think that the movie about a boy and a tiger stuck together in the middle of the ocean for months after the horrible shipwreck on the drifting lifeboat which the ferocious tiger first claimed as his territory and a makeshift inflatable raft chained to it which was Pi's fragile shelter would be so compelling and gripping but it was. Roger Ebert said that Life of Pi is ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I gladly agree with that. I simply can't find anything wrong with ""Life of Pi."" It is beautiful, profound and adventurous story of survival and understanding life with all it offers or throws at us. It is life affirming even though it takes us along with Pi Patel through unspeakable hardship, losses, and deadly danger of indifferent and indomitable forces of nature's elements and wild creatures. And it manages to say a lot about faith and God without being over-simplistic, preachy or shoving religion in your face. It may help an atheist to understand the believers better or at least to try. It also turns itself in unexpected direction when we thought we were in the end of the journey, reflects on the darkest corners of human nature and leaves the viewers asking questions on what they really want to believe and whether they are open to the possibility of miracle in life, in their lives. It is up to the viewers to choose the answer only they would be satisfied with.Peaceful beauty of Pondicherry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story. Well, it is coming of age story but amazing on so many levels, spiritual, ethical, physical, religious, humanistic, testing the limits of what a human being can deal with and how it would shape him, his life, and his perception of life. This is an experience, both movie watching and afterthought that will stay with me. What else can I ask for in a movie? I've always respected and admired Ang Lee and found his movies exquisite. But ""Life of Pi"" is without doubt his best work. Furious tiger, brave boy, magic journey, fascinating story - amazing movie.","

"gavin6942","24 February 2013","A young man (Suraj Sharma) who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger (Richard Parker). Let me first say that I am glad that M. Night Shyamalan did not end up directing this film. Could he have made it successful? Possibly. But, he does have a stigma attached to him that Ang Lee does not have. Lee may not be a critically-heralded director, but he is not a running joke, either. And after this film, he may start getting more offers.Lee says in making this film, he had to ""disguise a philosophical book as an adventure story"". Although I have not read the book, this sounds spot on. The concepts presented are certainly religious, or at least spiritual, and there is always the feeling that there is more going on than the parts we can see with our eyes.Roger Ebert called the film ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I will grant that it was excellent storytelling, and would need at least two viewings to fully appreciate. The visual mastery is a bit harder for me to get behind. Some of the visuals are spectacular, while others I felt never quite seemed real enough. Technology has come a long way, but I still know a fake tiger when I see one.The story works great, and carries itself in three stages. (Here is where the spoilers start, so stop now if you have not seen it.)The first stage is the overt religious and spiritual stage. Once we get past the jokes about ""Piscine Patel"", we see a brief exploration of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Certainly nothing thorough, but we get the idea of how we can approach the world seeing one god as many, or many gods as one, and not find it to be contradictory. If the film is going to convince us to believe in God, we have to join him on this quest. (I suspect it goes deeper in the book.)The second stage is during the days at sea. We have the reference to Richard Parker, here a name for a tiger but also the name of a classic shipwrecked sailor. In some ways, the story here parallels that of the real-life sailor and the Parker from the Edgar Allen Poe story. We also have the introduction of ""Tsimtsum"". I did not know the term while watching the movie, but felt it must have been important. (Why a Japanese ship had a Hebrew name is anyone's guess.) I now know it is a Kabbalah term about God's being simultaneously transcendent and within the world. A concept that is both contradictory and necessary. It also explains how Pi survives...The third stage is the last few minutes, when we hear the parallel story about the cannibalistic cook. Is this the real story? Is it a metaphor for the other story, which was actually the true story? Is either one true? And ultimately, does it matter? Here, after we are immersed in faith for two hours, we are left to decide: which is the true story, and does it matter which? (With Pi the only survivor, any story he creates will be the only story that will be recorded as the true story -- he has essentially created his own world.)","

"Reno-Rangan","22 November 2012","Well, one of most expected movie of 2012 by me. It was not a colorful visual movie like 'Avatar' which was bluish Or 'Hugo' which was orangish except in few scenes that too come in night shot though IMO you should not compare it with above two. Many part of 3D sequences were just awesome.It could have been more violent and sentimental story that ever told on this theme but not, the director cleverly blended the humor with character emotions very nicely, thats why it was just ratted PG where children are allowed with their parents approval, but it is common for them to see an animal to kill another in Animal Planet, so its not a big deal i think. The CGI animal(s) were looked so clean and good.I must say the movie don't offer what you expect from its trailer, in movie it was totally different than any movie in the world except Waterworld + Cast Away + Castle in the Sky = Life Of Pi, i am not comparing it to other 3 but saying got similarity in some parts.I did not like the end much, I mean the way it ended was not proper, I thought it still had something to go far away then realized it happen only in commercial movies.My question is can this movie do good business which got no big names and cast!? Indian cast, Taiwan's talent, American product and a great effort of various technicians from around the world is equal to LIFE OF PI in Pacific ocean over 227 days. Hoping it gonna grab couple of awards in Academy award. Worth watching it in 3D, Someday in future you can say that i was in there when it came out when it called epic like what we call some of classical movies today.You could see better and beautiful India in beginning few Minutes than any Hollywood movie which deal on Indian subject. people from in and around Pondicherry can feel proud, why not whole Indians can. The images from the movie will remain in our eyes for some time even after you left the cinema hall specially may be you won't forget the name Richard Parker.And now i go for 9 outa 10 saying must see specially we Indian coz we cant make movie like this at least for right now in our own but we can watch this western piece of Indian art carved Ang Lee.There is a chance it gonna replace 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as his (Ang Lee's) best, i said may be so lets see. Might be i am little excited for seeing it in preview show lets see what happens later days and what others say.9½/10","

"kenjha","8 June 2013","After his ship is hit by a storm, a young Indian man finds himself adrift on a boat with a tiger. The cinematography is so dazzling that Lee won an Oscar for this, one of the few instances where a director has won without the film winning Best Picture. Unfortunately, Lee is better with the special effects than with the actors, whose performances are uneven at best. While the movie looks great, like pretty postcards, the script, based on a popular novel, is too weak to sustain interest. The story, disjointed and somewhat clumsily structured with flashbacks, is fantastic and nonsensical, and ultimately pointless. The characters are meant to be wise and worldly but come across as shallow caricatures.","

"BJBatimdb","26 December 2012","I haven't read Life of Pi, and feel that being too faithful to the book may have been where screenwriter David Magee went wrong.At its heart it seems to be a simple story - an allegory about a boy and a tiger that masks an horrific experience on board a drifting lifeboat. However, the structure of the piece means that when the truth is finally relayed in the film, all its impact is lost in the confusion of what has gone before. Instead of shock, I felt only irritation that the two-hour allegory had been so unambiguous and had given no hints to the truth which - for maximum effect - should have immediately become apparent in the telling of the second story. So instead of feeling illuminated by the end, I felt cheated and disappointed.Visually it's gorgeous, the acting is first rate, the CGI seamless and the 3D is nice enough, but the movie drags in several places (the mangrove island is just pretty padding) and although the animals portrayed are CGI versions, they are so realistic that I was more upset by the scenes of their slaughter than I was when that was related to the deaths of real people. I would not take a child to see this movie without considering the scenes of animal suffering. Just because they are CGI animals does not make it less traumatic.All in all, a disappointing trip to the movies, where I felt the writer and director lost sight of the most important emotional arc and thereby diminished any impact at the end which would have made up for a rather slow - if beautiful - film.","

"TimelessFlight","5 June 2023","Life of Pi is a wonderful film; creative, troubling, moving and stunningly beautiful.It tells the highly unusual story of 'Pi' - a young boy - who is stranded at sea on a small boat after the ship on which he was a passenger sinks during a violent storm. He is not alone - sharing the tiny boat with him are a handful of animals, including a Bengal Tiger who he calls Richard Parker. They too were aboard the ship (part of a zoo being transported) and made it to the lifeboat with Pi.If this seems a rather fanciful plot, don't let it put you off. By the time you get to this part of the story you'll be well immersed in this fabulous film, and indeed such is the exceptional skill of the film makers that you'll feel well and truly onboard the boat with them.The animals are of course cgi creations, but so brilliantly done that it doesn't seem that way. The journey that unfolds takes us through moments of danger, despair, hallucination, survival and tenderness. It is utterly gripping and leads us to an understated ending that invites us to question just who or what was on that little boat.A highly distinctive, visually original and emotionally compelling film that I can highly recommend.","

"mursel-502-657523","25 November 2012","Life of Pi is a triumph visually - one of the most magical experiences I've ever had at the movies. Even more importantly, it's a triumph of a story.I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist. When I heard the words ""I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God"", I was suitably skeptical.The movie did not succeed in getting me to believe in God. However, the pivotal but ever-so-subtle dialog near the end really cemented why so many people the world over choose the target of their faith.Piscene asks ""Which story do you prefer?"" Not ""which story do you believe?"" or ""Which story do you think is true?"", just ""Which story do you prefer?"" I've seen other reviews of this move that refer to the ""twist"" ending. There is no twist here, just an incredibly well-presented allegory. There's also many reviews talking about the triumph of endurance and human spirit. Those indeed are present in the story, but not so important as the central point - the crux of the matter.""Which story do you prefer?"" The answer of course is a perfect allegory of religion. The fundamental stories are similar no matter which characters are in the pivotal roles.""Which story do you prefer?"" As Pi answers, ""And so it is with God."" A faith-shaking thought indeed.Depending on how you see the world and religion's place in it, the question may affirm or cause questions of your own faith. Is your religion's story true? Or just preferred? And more importantly, does it matter? What this movie drove home for me was that religions all have the same benefits and by extension, they all have the same flaws.Which story do you prefer? To Ang Lee, Yann Martel, David Magee and all involved in bringing this story to the screen, thank you! It is so refreshing to be viscerally, philosophically and intellectually entertained all at the same time.","

"filipemanuelneto","3 June 2022","After having seen this film, which adapts a novel with the same name, I was in doubt about what to think. Directed by Ang Lee, the film is a true visual spectacle and takes advantage of the best that high-quality CGI can add to a film. However, we have to agree that it is a still film, which stretches its story as far as it can, placing it on a metaphysical and theological background that can complicate the story for some people.Piscine Molitor Patel, called Pi Patel to facilitate and avoid embarrassing puns, is the young hero of this film. He was born and lives with his family in Pondicherry, in former French India. However, finances are not going well, and they are forced to leave, closing the zoo they manage there, and leaving for Canada with most of the animals. It so happens that, during the trip, the Japanese freighter they boarded on is caught in a typhoon and sinks. Clinging to a lifeboat, he survives, accompanied by Richard Parker, the irascible and terrifying Bengal tiger from his family's zoo, beginning a journey of survival and discovery of the sacred, and of himself.In fact, if there is one thing that stood out before my eyes in this film, it is the search that the main character makes about God, since childhood, in which he assumes several religions that are perfectly different. He seems to be engaged in a search for God's truth, not just experimenting with religions and beliefs, or mixing them up to his liking. The trip on that boat, therefore, reminds us a little of the despair of biblical figures like Jonah or Job, from whom everything was taken away so that, in the depths of their misery, they could find God. The film still makes a number of small changes when compared to the original book. I'm not the best person to evaluate them, but I'm not surprised by these creative liberties.Suraj Sharma is a completely unknown actor to me, but he does his part very well here, and he sounds authentic and true. He is the great actor present in the film and it is his work that gives him body and soul. Irrfan Khan was also up to his task and makes a welcome and very successful contribution. In between, we see Gerard Depardieu in a brief cameo that adds little to the film.Technically, the film makes clever and creative use of computer resources, CGI and green screen, as mentioned earlier. The quality of the work is such that we are in doubt about what we are seeing, especially with regard to the animals and their coat and appearance. The meerkat island was also magnificent, and there are several scenes at sea where light was masterfully used. The cinematography and editing were masterfully executed, the sets and costumes are authentic and the soundtrack is truly good and engaging.","

"DICK STEEL","2 December 2012","Once, many thought that Life of Pi, based upon the novel by Yann Martel, was unfilmmable. But I guess it takes a special someone with much imagination and gusto to tackle it head on, dealing with three aspects many filmmakers would largely and automatically shy away from - children, animals and plenty of water - and delivering one riveting picture that's as visually arresting as it is dramatically challenging in its tale of fantasy, religion, philosophy and life.In what would essentially be a one man show for the most parts, almost akin to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks in terms of a tale on the human spirit, Ang Lee didn't have the luxury of a world renowned actor at his side delivering soliloquy after soliloquy, but had the luxury of improved technology to assist in his cause. And technology this time helped to transform this story into what it was, especially when it came to dealing with animals, having to weaken a Bengali tiger over a period of time, as well as to shoot scenes of nature and the food chain, which in normal circumstances would be almost impossible to create and control.Life of Pi is what it is, with Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi for short, with an extended little sub-arc to tell of his creation of the nickname, now an adult (Irrfan Khan), and telling his remarkable tale of shipwreck and survival in his family's uprooting from India toward Canada in search of a new life outside of the own they know of, which involved a zoo. But as it turns out, the Japanese vessel they are travelling in sank during a storm encountered while in the Miranda Trench, and the few survivors turned out to be Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and finally, one of the earth's most dangerous predators, the tiger nicknamed Richard Parker.Much of the narrative then deals with man versus animal, man versus nature and the elements, and Pi's survival while having to deal with a predator at his doorstep. In Cast Away, Tom Hanks has Wilson to interact with, while here it's a battle between Pi and Richard Parker, which one can allude or metaphors as a battle within oneself for necessities and wants, and the picking up of essential skills to survive. One took us on a slice of life trip on a deserted island, while this one takes us on a slice of life trip drifting along in the vast waters of the Pacific Ocean, amongst what would be one of the last frontiers on the planet.And this is opportunity for plenty of gorgeous, hyper imagery and visuals, that makes it a technological wet dream to deploy the kind of firepower money can buy for a movie. There's 3D technology, IMAX with its different aspect ratios that creep in during stylized sequences, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography exploiting what's best to bring about plenty of exquisitely crafted, postcard picturesque landscapes and waterscapes that will leave one astounded as these effectively augment the themes of the story, especially dealing with nature, bearing witness to both the tranquility and the ferocity that it can bring.What made it a lot admirable, is that Ang Lee decided to stick to his guns and cast a group of relative unknowns, and handing over the lead role to a new actor Suraj Sharma, who repaid the director's faith manifold. It demonstrates the leap of faith the director had to undertake, mirroring the same leap of faith Pi had in committing his survival to higher powers, doing the best with what he has at his disposal, with circumstances and outcome for someone higher up to decide. Suraj Sharma holds his own and doesn't look overawed, or too raw for a role that deals with a coming of spiritual age of sorts, and I won't be surprised if this film provides that career boost along the same lines as Dev Patel's of Slumdog Millionaire.Those who have read the book will know of a second story arc that provides the crux of most post-viewing discussion, allowing points to be made in support of, or against each version being told by Pi. What I thought interesting was how either could be truth, and it says a lot about what us humans would like to hear - only the good stuff, and that in which we can process or accept, and is more palatable for various reasons, versus something that requires a huge dose of faith and belief from the storyteller. In light of what we cannot verify, this theme turns Life of Pi into something of a religious debate, especially since Pi himself is something of a religion connoisseur, dabbling in many and yet being the master of none.Still, if that doesn't really appeal to you, then Ang Lee's story-telling craft of Yann Martel's fantasy will, of a remarkable trip across an ocean, filled with sadness, despair, yet about survival and hope, complete with stunning visuals that will keep you mesmerized for the most parts, about a boy, a tiger, and the life boat they find themselves sharing under extraordinary circumstances. A definite recommendation, and would probably be shortlisted as one of my favourites of the year!","

"Hitchcoc","22 January 2013","This is the most wonderfully original movie I've seen in such a long time. It is set up with an amazing touch. We are absorbed into the Indian culture by some of the most lovely people. They are understanding of Pi's dilemmas and his religious confusion. They support him, although he is an arrogant little twit at times. There is an amazing scene where he shatters his boundaries and almost gets himself killed by the tiger who later becomes his shipmate. The special effects are probably some of the most believable and effective I have ever scene, from the shipwreck to the game of (excuse the expression) cat and mouse that ensues. We are totally involved in the incredible story of Pi and how he uses his knowledge and survival skills to maintain both his life and his sanity. The tiger, Richard Parker, is so well conceived and so believable in his own evolution that we grow to feel for him and his fate. There is a comradeship that one can only view. I found myself describing this movie to a friend, and when I finished he acted like I was crazy to have liked it. I guess Pi felt the same way. This is a movie that takes a wonderful book and an amazing story to new depths. There is also, of course, Pi's struggle with his views of a god that he can't quite define. His is an honest doubt. No character in fiction is asked for more and has to question the entity that he says as responsible for the loss of his family and his abject loneliness in the middle of the Pacific. I can't wait for this to come out on video so I can savor it again. My regret is that I didn't get to see it in 3D which I don't normally care for.","

"gogojirago","2 January 2013","I read ""Life of Pi"" a couple of years ago while I was touring around Europe and I found it to be a mildly-entertaining book which touched lightly on the philosophical side. It was no surprise to me then, when I discovered Ang Lee's faithful film adaptation to be exactly that - mildly entertaining, touching lightly on the philosophical side.I believe a lot of people came to watch this movie with many different expectations, from those who wanted to watch a realistic sea-survival movie, contrasted by those who believed it would offer something truly deep and significant philosophically. Both these camps will be disappointed. As Jonathan Romney says in the IOS review ""Life of Pi is fatally scuppered by coy, bogus mysticism."" Conversely, as you will read on the message boards here at IMDb (spoilers abound there, be forewarned!) a lot of people couldn't even handle the philosophy-lite that was on offer and were ""disappointed"" that it wasn't the straight- forward boy-lost-at-sea-with-a-tiger story it falsely claimed to be (*deep breath*). Hey everybody, this film will not change your life. It will provide you with some inoffensive entertainment for a couple of hours, and probably little more.""Life of Pi"" - whether in book-form or in this adaptation - is neither high art, nor gruelling adventure. What it actually is is a fantasy story, framed at the edges with a smidgeon of realism in an attempt to add a soupçon of depth and food-for-thought. Approach the film as such and you may well enjoy it. As a heavily CGI-ed film it provides at times a stunning visual work. Again reviewers have been mixed, some claiming that the over-playing of visuals falls into the garish, and attempts to wash over the philosophical shallowness of the movie. Well, CGI is the trend today; it has some benefits, but the overall effect of digitally rendering your characters and sceneries is bound to leave something missing soul-wise. ""Life of Pi"" is pretty enough to look at, but personally I think much more could and would have been made of it if it was adapted as an (classic style) animation.I'd mark the film as 6.5 (it made my partner cry), but I'm rounding down this time because of the sudden wave of sycophancy present on IMDb, meaning that every film that comes out has 8-point-something (corporate presence?). Either way, a pleasant break from Hollywood aggression, and worth a watch.","

"bkoganbing","13 April 2013","With four people bringing the life of Pi Patel to the big screen, no wonder no Oscars were given out in the Best Acting category. All four seem to function as a unit as the oldest one tells the story of an amazing adventure to a writer who has been told that Pi has an incredible tale to tell. The lack nominations in the acting categories is made up by the four Oscars Life Of Pi won this past year in the technical categories. The computer graphics are something else.Like Gloria Stuart retelling her life as a Titanic survivor and the audience seeing Kate Winslet playing it out on the big screen, Irrfan Khan recounts his surviving a shipwreck where he and his family are taking a bunch of zoo animals from India to Canada where the Japanese freighter they're on is sunk with all hands lost.Young Suraj Sharma manages to swim to a floating and empty lifeboat which turns out not to be so empty as a few of the zoo animals also make it there. Including a young and hungry Bengal Tiger cub who is very hungry. I won't say more because at this point the computer graphic special effects takes over. Some miracles are provided, but maybe the biggest miracle of all is that the tiger and Pi decide they really do need each other. Pi who checked out all forms of religious beliefs calls on all the Deities he's learned on for help. The biggest help granted is if not a change of nature, a curbing of the carnivorous nature of the tiger to save the Life Of Pi.I was kind of lost at the message part, just what director Ang Lee was saying about nature and nature's God to use Jefferson's phrase. But the technical achievements of the film truly do dwarf whatever message that was being told about life. Those achievements have vaulted Life Of Pi to the top of the cinematic world and it's likely to remain there.","

"meeza","25 November 2012","The Angular tales are back with another Ang Lee feature. Director Lee is never timid in taking on a wide array of genres when tackling on a movie. And in his latest ""Life of Pi"" he might have just discovered a new genre for motion pictures because Pi serves such themes as adventure, love, courage, man vs. beast, family, religion, regret, friendship, survival, and a few others all in one just movie. ""Life of Pi"" is the most beautiful looking picture of the year, and it will have its Pi I mean eye on the Oscar prize of many technical categories including Best cinematography, sound effects, editing, special effects, and art direction. By the way, the 3-D in this picture is used to its apex. The movie features our protagonist Pi Patel first as an adult telling his incredible teen tale to a journalist, and then it rewinds to flashback in the telling of his unforgettable adventure at sea. Pi's real name is Piscine, so you could imagine how much he was bullied at school due to his name. His father named him Piscine because of his love of pools; but come on bro, out of all the pool of names you could have named your son, why that one? To avoid future name harassment, Pi during his teens, decided to shorten out his name to Pi; an incredible scene in the movie shows Pi in a 3.14 craze demonstrating to his classmates how the Pi equation is calculated in order for them to comprehend that he is now a Pi not a Piscine. Pi's parents live in India and own a farm. When economic problems arise, Pi's father decides to move teen Pi and the family from India to Canada. His plan is to sell the farm (literally) in Canada. To do this, he must first take the family and the animals on a freight ship at sea to Canada. And that is when ""Life of Pi"" transposes itself to a mystical ""survival-at-sea"" flick. A brutal storm causes a shipwreck which Pi bravely survives. Consequently, he is stranded on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Yea, that happened to me also. Anyways, Director Lee carries the picture into a thrilling state of ""young man vs. beast"" for survival. And he brilliantly depicts the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker as the forefront on many of the film's messages about the aforementioned themes. Wait, I must take a break. My cat Douglas Simpson is hungry and I must feed him. OK, that's enough. David Magee's endearing screenplay also deserves an Oscar nod for its relative verbose within Lee's direction. And Ang is a shoe-in for a Best Director Oscar nomination, I must say. Another what should be a sure Oscar nomination is Newcomer Suri Sharma's mesmeric performance as the teen Pi. And Surily I can be serious! Veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan was solid as the adult Pi, but the young Pi Sharma had the more tasty scenes for a thespian showcase. So without a doubt, on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 being excellent), ""Life of Pi"" is not a 4 but much better than a 3.14. ***** Excellent","

"tmservo","17 November 2012","We were able to see this at an early screening but per that paper, not to say anything until after other screenings. So, now it's screened elsewhere I can pitch in my thoughts.Life of Pi is a film that absolutely surprised me. I had not read the book, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I knew that a film from Ang Lee would be exceptionally well done, and I wasn't wrong. This is an incredibly strong work, on par with ""Crouching Tiger"" .. Not through action or events but in the way the cinematography, camera movements and beautiful settings help draw a viewer in and really sell the story.The Life of Pi is so well crafted that it moves effortlessly between a story of youth to a story of adulthood. If you have not read the book, the ending is the kind of twist that while completely understandable redefines your entire film experience in a way I hadn't been a part of since ""The Sixth Sense"". You immediately think back over the entirety of the film and see it in a drastically different way and it works.No matter the perspective you chose, this is an amazingly well acted, well directed film that goes into my list of some of the best films I've seen this year.I watched in 3D, but this is a film full of so many bright colors and scenes that I will seek out a chance to see it in 2D just for the beauty of the scenes. Strongly recommended.","

"nrbarton","28 February 2013","I went to see 'Life Of Pi' in 3D as I'd heard what an amazing, life-changing movie it was, and that it was one of the best uses of 3D ever. Unfortunately it was neither of these things. Theoretically, it's a movie which few people should actually like, and should offend religious people, yet almost everyone seems to be lapping it up like God's very own ejaculate.I'll get the 3D aspect out of the way first. Whilst the visuals were brilliant, beautiful and sometimes breathtaking with vibrant fluorescent colours, there wasn't a single shot of 3D in the entire film that made me think, 'that's impressive use of 3D', and I'm a fan of good 3D. Whilst Pi was poking a stick at the screen, instead of it coming out at me in 3D, it was a rather pathetic, unfocused blur.The film is about a boy/young man called Pi who was shipwrecked. A writer tracks him down as he hears Pi has a wonderful story that will supposedly make him believe in God. Pi tells the story and it's incredibly long-winded with nothing remotely miraculous in it, mostly just a load of bad luck. Most of the story is Pi and a tiger stuck on a small rescue boat, and whilst that's interesting for a while, after about an hour, it becomes really rather tedious.Pi then tells a second story which is the true version of events, and there's nothing remotely miraculous in that one either, again just a load of bad luck. At this point I was thinking 'I cannot believe I've spent about an hour watching Pi and a tiger on a boat when it never even happened and he was just bulls**tting us'.So basically he tells two stories, one of which is lies and one true. He then asks the writer which story he prefers and he says he, ""The one with the tiger. That's the better story."" Pi responds, ""Thank you. And so it goes with God."" However, just because the writer preferred the first story doesn't mean he now believes in God like Pi claimed he would; he merely liked the first story better. Just like Pi's first story, this claim is more bulls**t from a compulsive liar. Personally, I liked the second story much better, which was never even shown, merely given a brief spoken account of. It sounded like it would have made a far better movie than an hour on a boat befriending a tiger. What Pi should have said is that the two stories he was about to tell would make the writer understand the nature of faith better, not make him believe in God.The message,which began with Pi as a kid following three different religions, and ended with him spelling out that that it doesn't matter which story(religion/belief) is true, just follow the one you like the best and comforts you the most, is a terrible message. It teaches people that it's OK to believe in lies instead of the truth, to follow a religion just because it has a nice story, and maybe even follow a few simultaneously then you can enjoy all the various stories.The movie tries to have an open-minded, positive message about religion, encompassing them all. That's all very well for teaching tolerance of other religions, but as a message it's problematic as I just find it so flaky. Since when has the truth been so unimportant? The truth is important and I won't let this ill-thought-out movie tell me otherwise. As someone who doesn't agree with the concept of believing in lies just to comfort oneself with a nice story, the message went against what I believe.Furthermore, I don't understand how anyone religious could like the movie either. Surely the whole point of religion is to follow it because you actually believe it to be the truth, not just because it's comforting and a nice story. If I was religious then I would find this message patronising and offensive. Religious people praising the movie can only mean one of two things: 1) They're fully aware that their religion is a lie and don't care as they're happy just liking the story 2) They didn't get the message of the film. Neither of these reasons are anything to be proud of.The only demographic I would imagine liking this film are flaky people, and people who think being flaky is acceptable, or even admirable. According to IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, this is over 80% of the population. I can't say I find THAT true story very comforting, but, as the truth is apparently not important, maybe I should believe that nobody is flaky and everyone else agrees with me and sees 'Life Of Pi' for what it really is. If there's one thing I can't stand it's flakiness; it's annoying and you never know where you stand with such people or what they stand for.I liked the idea of a story being too traumatic to tell so giving a false version with symbolism instead, but the message about religion was stupid. If people simply enjoyed the journey then that's fine but it isn't that interesting, and without the message, hollow. People thinking the message is wonderfully deep, beautiful and philosophical, however, need to quit being such flakes and give themselves a slap. Yann Martel, who wrote this 'lying-is-wonderful' story, needs to find another career and spare the world from more stupid messages.Other than impressive and beautiful visuals, a few lines of good humour and a shipwreck, this film had nothing for me. Plus it dragged, like Ang Lee movies tend to; I would honestly have preferred to sit through his 'Hulk' movie a second time. Pi is a boring, time-wasting, flaky, bulls**tting douche, and I'd be grateful if next time he kept his ill-thought-out, tediously long-winded stories to himself.","

I mean, it was so fascinating watching this Indian teen survive being in a lifeboat for who knows how many days with a Bengal tiger always threatening to eat him. And his later adult self telling it to an author provides some explanation for his beliefs and what have you. And the visuals, which we saw in 3-D, were so awesome! Ditto the music. I can't think of anything else to say but oh, what an experience! I really can't think of anything to say except what are you waiting for?

"tedg","8 January 2013","How is it that Scorsese can get 3D so wrong and someone like Ang Lee get it so right?Sure, there is some dimensional silliness — a hummingbird in the first few moments... a message thrown into the water that lands in our laps — but the general philosophy here is to use the technology to define *space*. Usually, we are given an array of objects, but here the goal is space itself.I have been seeing very few movies recently, but I think so far as the handling of space, this film is important — a real advance over what went before. Compare for instance the handling of the water in the shipwreck to that of ""Titantic"" or ""Perfect Storm"" or ""White Squall."" The water here is architectural, dynamic but conceived as a whole. When I've noted previous advances in the cinema of space, they have been less in the architecture and more in the introduction of height, the position of the virtual camera and the emotions evoked by how that camera moves.Following the ideas of the book about the folding of experience, story-telling and religious ecstasy, we have visual metaphoric blending of underwater, various effects on the surface of water, stars, storms and modes of fluorescence in each of these. The notion is that the story with the tiger is likely fiction, and that the 'real' story was not 'as good.' We have strong hints that this is so in the written dialog, so the cinematic notion of merging dynamics below the sea with action above the sea makes sense. This begins early in the story with a shot of the famed swimming pool after which our hero is named. Late in the shot we realize the camera is underwater. Soon, the water becomes sky.But because we have shared what came before with our own eyes, we can't unknow it. It becomes folded reality.Another example: early we see a Hindu ceremony with thousands of candles floating on water. The father-voice-of-reason says ""do not be fooled by the lights."" Shortly thereafter we have the lights on the ship moving underwater and presumably triggering the untrusted narration. These lights were previously on the surface, and it seemed to me that the same visual cues were present in these — and later — lights as those we saw in the ceremony.This sort of visual coherence is only possible now where essentially every background is a synthesized one. When you create the world, you can create it your way.So the larger framing has an underwater with the ship named after the kabbalistic (recent kabbalah, not genuine historical kabbalah) notion of truth coalescing around the most attractive story. That ship is lit — again a kabbalistic reference, and the lights morph to totems: animals, symbols and memories. The sprites used in the software to model the flow of particles under the sea is used to model the turbulence on the surface and sky. Further, an associated notion is that everything must be considered as a whole situated assembly; in story terms that is the truth of coherence; in cinematic terms it is the focus on the coherence of space.Lee has always done something like this, even in his student films about dinner tables. In ""Crouching Tiger"" the fight choreography was calligraphic and was shown that way, so this was expected. But it IS an advance in the vocabulary and should be seen if only for the cinematic thrill of being present when our imagination advances a step. Note especially how the final shot does a reverse rack where the background moves closer after his feline self has 'left him.'But it fails as a compelling narrative for me. The kid in the boat seemed too Mowgli Disney perfect and not sufficiently broken to be believable. Though the cinematic tone is well thought out, it is presented too much as reality for me. The distance in abstraction between the framing device (the adult recounting a version of the story) and the story is too close. We might have done better to have the framing bits use a different technique, and the tiger be more supernatural.We do have *some* supernatural elements: the magical whale, the storm that seizes the written story, the fact that corpses and excrement vanish from the always sterile boat. The magical island's tooth (truth). The fact that a Japanese ship packs a survival manual in English. But these are plot points, not parts of the world. Tarsem Singh might have done better in this regard.We can assume that the 'alternative story' was shot, because you wouldn't hire Gérard Depardieu for one part of one scene. Perhaps we can see it in a recut version. Hey, if Decker can be a replicant in later versions of ""Bladerunner,"" maybe Anandi can be a life-dancer, the real narrator.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

Once it gets past a lot of religious issues/questions and a set up for what the movie is really about, it is pretty awesome to view. The CGI here is really amazing though sometimes occasionally too artificially beautiful, but nevertheless, this is a gorgeous film. It is also extremely original, exciting and inventive with again, too pretty for words cinematography. The ending of the amazing adventure within the film is also rather touching and a little sad when all is said and done. All in all, it's a pretty impressive piece of craftsmanship.","

Ang Lee's masterful adaptation of the best selling novel by Yann Martel about a young man's survival of an ocean liner sinking castaway with only its other sole survivor, his family's zoo's Bengal tiger. Told in flashback with a few digressions about faith, religion, the human spirit and ultimately the meaning of life, this journey into one's soul is remarkably captured with impressive CGI (Richard Parker, the aforementioned fierce companion), gorgeously stunning cinematography by Claudio Miranda and a stripped down screenplay by David Magee propels the story with some amazing set pieces of nature unleashed as well as the inner voice we all share: what is my life REALLY about? Poignant, funny and ultimately life- affirming; a must see and the 3D is truly amazingly captured at full force.","

"classicsoncall","6 October 2017","What amazes me about director Ang Lee is the totally disparate types of films that he puts together. One wonders how ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and this movie all come from the same creative mind. I just find it fascinating.Of those other films mentioned, this is one that comes closest to resembling a spiritual journey for the principal character. Told at first as an allegory, and later contrasted with the 'true' story of what happened when the young Pi (Suraj Sharma) survived a shipwreck ordeal, this appears to be Lee's take on a search for God and for the meaning of existence. I didn't find the adult Pi's (Irrfan Khan) challenge to the writer (Rafe Spall) about the proof of God's existence as being definitive, and I don't think that's what one's take on the picture ought to be.I think what the story should reaffirm in anyone watching it is that one has to meet life's challenges as they occur with a sole reliance on one's ability to think things through, form a plan, and execute it to the best of one's ability. What Pi had to endure on the open ocean was nothing short of an impossible situation, yet he made the most of it by using his own wits and the available resources he had. That he had to overcome the challenge of a vicious adversary in the tiger, forced Pi to consider his options, none of which included the easy way out of simply giving up.The CGI and special effects in the picture are extraordinary, as evidenced by awards won for Cinematography and Visual Effects at the 2013 Oscars. For his effort, Ang Lee also took home a Best Director. It's on the strength of this and other films by Lee that I seek out his work whenever a new picture comes out that he's directed. Whether you like them or not, he always delivers a compelling movie that makes you think when it's over, and that for me is always a good thing.","

He wants to hear the story of how Pi survived alone on a lifeboat after a shipwreck; Pi corrects him he wasn't alone he had Richard Parker for company. As Pi introduces his story we learn how he got his name, his unusual 'multi-faith' belief system and most importantly we learn that Richard Parker is an adult Bengal Tiger! His father runs a zoo in their hometown but when it looks like they can't continue running it he decides to emigrate to Canada with his family and the animals. Shortly after entering the Pacific Pi goes on deck to watch a storm then Pi finds himself thrown into a lifeboat as the ship starts to sink. He isn't alone; part of the menagerie is with him an injured zebra, an orang-utan and a vicious hyena. The hyena soon kills the zebra and orang-utan then the previously unseen tiger erupts from under a canvass and kills the hyena; it then turn its attention to Pi. He gets out of its reach and constructs a raft so he can keep away from the creature. Over the course of the film he comes to realise that Richard Parker's presence is keeping him sane while never forgetting he is still on the menu!This film was a delight. Even though we know Pi must survive to tell his tale there are plenty of tense moments and I was genuinely concerned for Pi's safety. For most of the film we are just watching Pi and the tiger; this works because both characters are so believable perhaps a little surprising when one knows the tiger didn't exist it is however the best CGI I've seen; it is hard to believe it isn't real. Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a great job convincing us that he is on a small boat in the middle of the ocean with a tiger. The whole film looks great; at times it takes on an almost dream like quality as the boat is becalmed on a mirror flat sea and when the sea lights up thanks to bioluminescent plankton. Some may find the ending a bit of a cop out as it appears that much of what we have seen didn't actually happen; an alternate scenario is presented and, as Pi says, the viewer must decide which story they prefer.","

"lasttimeisaw","11 March 2013","I cannot overpower my very own purist's paranoia, I watched this film in theater a few days earlier in dubbed Italian (my Italian level is so-so), I could not reckon that any film has been officially ""viewed"" until I have watched it in its original form, so thanks to the latest BluRay copy, finally I am able to hail LIFE OF PI as my current favorite film of 2012! Although the film literally is the biggest Oscar winner this year (4 wins out of 11 nominations) and Ang Lee now is up among the pre-eminent echelon of a multi-times BEST DIRECTOR winner, the unfulfilled appreciation (from the prim Academy) still seethes inside, the BEST PICTURE/BEST DIRECTOR division has stuck Ang Lee and his teams twice is unprecedentedly jaundiced. Back to the film itself, I am pretty oblivious to Yann Martel's source novel, but Ang Lee and his crew has deserved every single accolade because the outcome is simply astounding and mind-blowing, from the exotic Indian zoo, the palette of liveliness and quietude seeps directly to viewer's mind curves, then, the visual stunts take over, the minutiae are constructed into an inconceivable kaleidoscope of sea survival (ship-wrecking, heaven-like sea surface, carnivore island).The allegorical storyline which can be laconically recapitulated as ""the story between a boy and a Bengal tiger floating on the sea"", also goes beyond one's mundane imagination, the liaison between Pi and Richard Parker the tiger has gone through a minute incubation-to- transition cliffhanger (technically it is not a cliffhanger since we all know the ending beforehand, but the two-hander just conjures magic spell upon us, which is mesmerizing, eye-popping and heart-warming), with the brilliant first-time actor Suraj Sharma interacting viscerally with the green screen (an almost entirely CGI-germinated tiger heralds the auspicious retirement of all the animal cast, as long as money continues investing, leave those poor animals in peace and so are the ever-engaging animal activist). Both Suraj and Irrfan Khan (the adult Pi) deserve more recognition from their meticulous and soul-searching performances. Being an agnostic, Pi's eclectic belief in all disparate religions doesn't register enough contention to me, and also it is claimed to be ""a story could make one believe in God"", the film is marvelous in keeping its ambivalence so determined that either of the interpretation could find its recipients piously and without arousing any palpable repulsion even we all know how parochial people could react as far as ""religions""is concerned. The film is a flawless eye-candy and soul-remedy, multiple viewings are highly- recommended, it is a conscientious masterstroke to corroborate Ang Lee's versatility in mastering his universe of filmmaking (no genre boundary at all), commixed his oriental philosophy with western first-class craftsmanship and esprit de corps, Ang Lee can swagger further on the path of a true auteur, not only among his peers, even for a holistic view in the film history, his trail can be indelible.","

"Bruce722","29 November 2012","I honestly didn't expect to say this again in the current calendar year but ""this is probably the best movie I have seen this year"". Yes, I think this is probably even a better movie that The Dark Knight Returns which I was all but certain would be my personal Picture of the Year winner. Life of Pi was simply amazing. The story is incredible and the way the film is delivered couldn't be better. You truly go on this story with Pi Patel and Richard Parker. The acting by Suraj Sharma is surprisingly fantastic as well. Some people will surely call this movie boring because it has a slower pace to it but Tom Hanks' Castaway film was also on the slower side and as that movie showed, if a film is well done the slow pace allows for more emotion and a connection to the characters. Shoot, I got watery eyes when Hanks' character lost Wilson and that was a stinking volleyball, lol. This movie plays along that same style of a slow paced story of survival but is done even better due to the incredible cinematography that rivals Avatar in terms of magnificence. Another thing Life of Pi did remarkably well was end without disappointment. By that, I do not mean that the ending isn't sad. I mean that the ending lives up to the film. Again, take Castaway for example. That movie was great but its ending was quick and left a lot to be desired. The ending for Life of Pi throws a subtle twist that is sort of a mind blowing moment. That subtle twist leaves you pondering the events of the film well after it ends.","

"nogodnomasters","24 July 2018","The film opens with a lengthy character build-up of Pi. It starts off with the crude explanation on how he got his name. It contrasts this with Pi's discovery of religion to the point of believing in universalism. His lofty ideas are quickly contrasted with a dose of reality when a tiger, he thinks he has connected with, eats a live goat. After he develops a love interest we finally come to the meat of the tale.His family opts to go to Canada on a Japanese merchant ship and if everything went okay, you wouldn't see a picture of Pi in a boat with said tiger promoting this film. His life's experience are reflected in his relationship with the tiger and survival at sea.Pi's life is one filled with contrasts. He is a microcosm of India and perhaps the world as his name is symbolic of the constant the defines circles, orbs, and globes. That is the spiritual aspect. However his name derives from the ""P"" word giving it a dose of crude reality. The film/book is designed to be a metaphor. This is demonstrated in the end when Pi gives us two stories, then asks, ""Which do you prefer?"" as a way to test one's views in a world of contrasts.While the film is interesting on a number of levels, it is heavily narrated with an accent. This caused me to occasionally miss a word every now and then. Hopefully the DVD will have English subtitles.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. While rated PG I thought Pi dropped the F-bomb near the end when he was talking about the two Japanese investigators. It was tough to tell with the accent. Beginning of film frequently refers to pi**ing.","

"TheSupertramp","23 November 2012","Ang Lee takes Yann Martel's much acclaimed novel and turns it into a collage full of masterful imagery and dream-like visuals, which remains at the core a profoundly simple tale of spirituality, in a manner which might leave you either with a wry smile and shake of head at what you just experienced or with a euphoric feeling equivalent to the one you get after seeing a magic trick. The thing with this magic however, is that it won't leave you for quite a long while and it might even make you question your most core beliefs. Or the lack of them.I don't believe in God but I do believe in the power of stories, imagery, art in it's most simple yet beautiful form and most of all in the power of words. I believe in the power of cinema, the moving images that can move you in more ways than you can imagine. That can transport you into another space and time, into a World full of possibilities. Of everything. Of nothing.And come to think of it believing in God may not be that much different.'Life Of Pi' is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement in terms of visual effects and images but it's real beauty lies in the story that is so simple in it's depiction yet so profound in it's impact.There are scenes of such wonderful amazement that words fall short often. Right from the beginning credits to the poignant scene when Pi leaves his lifeboat just after the ship-wreck and watches the mammoth ship sink underwater, the heart-pounding introduction of Richard Parker on the lifeboat, the surreal dream sequence of Pi, the many sunsets and nights at sea, the mesmerizing scene with the jellyfishes and blue whale and just so many other scenes that each one can be paused and made into a collection of brilliantly picturesque wallpapers. Such brilliant cinematic quality is very rare and it needs to be experienced on the hugest screen possible. It's why we go to the movies for. Ang Lee's direction is minimalistic and focused. Gentle and caressing. He does not make movies. He nurtures a baby and lets him out to play with us when he deems fit.The end is somewhat abrupt in it's flow but nevertheless compelling in it's effect. Suraj Sharma as Pi is very good. Tabu impresses in her short role and Aadil Hussain is effective. But like it's always in almost every movie that he does, it's the brilliant Irrfan Khan who etches out the older Pi with an absolutely touching performance. 'Life Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a shining crown jewel in this oceanic, gigantic world of cinema. Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't happen very often.""I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?"" ""The one with the Tiger."" ""And so it is with God.""I'm a believer. In something not very different from God I think.And yes, always ""the one with the Tiger.""","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","14 March 2018","Showered with praise upon its initial release mainly for its supposedly ground-breaking visual effects, this ambiguously fantastical survival story falls fairly flat thanks to the fact that, for much of its run-time, it's actually pretty boring and all the spectacular special effects in the world aren't enough to save a piece from sinking if it has the weight of tedium tied around its ankle. Even then, the effects in 'Life Of Pi (2012)' aren't all that impressive and haven't held up nearly as well as many pictures of a similar age (not that old at all I'll add) or even older, as well as including a few odd design decisions, such as evolving aspect ratios, that seem sort of justifiable but ultimately distracting. Its somewhat confusing commentary on spiritualism and the nature of truth is actually a nice conceit, but isn't fully formed enough to warrant its rampant lack of conclusiveness or make up for its inherent failings to tell a griping tale. 5/10","

"EUyeshima","16 December 2012","Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain""). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (""Howl's Moving Castle""). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.Adapted by David Magee (""Finding Neverland""), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' ""Cast Away"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan (""The Namesake"") plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from ""The Namesake"", Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and Gérard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall (""One Day"") plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward.","

"ferguson-6","26 November 2012","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we are reminded of just how stunning movies can be. Periodically a filmmaker proves to us that pushing the envelope of creativity still drives some auteurs. James Cameron brought us Avatar, which demonstrated that 3D technology could be beautiful and breath-taking. As beautiful and new as Cameron's breakthrough was, it lacked a story worthy of it advancements. Now, we get director Ang Lee's vision of Yann Martel's worldwide bestseller, and we are left gasping at what happens when you combine a fantastical story with technological advances and perfection.Ang Lee has provided us with a varied selection of films including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain; and Sense and Sensibility. He refuses to be limited by genre and takes a global and philosophical view of filmmaking. He wants us to think and discuss and think some more. His Life of Pi film purposefully leaves many scenes, events and thoughts open to interpretation. You can see as much or as little of humanity in this story as you like.The brilliant opening shows real animals in the real zoo located in Pondicherry, India. The colors, sights and sounds are dazzling and give us an immediate feel for the area. We meet young Pi and his family. Pi is inquisitive and ingenious from an early age. His father imparts such wisdom as ""If you believe in everything, you believe in nothing"". This comes as Pi is absorbing multiple religions and considers himself Hindu/Muslim/Christian. At an early age, he seeks answers and meaning. Soon enough, Pi and his family take their most valued animals on a ship to Canada. Disaster strikes when a storm capsizes the ship and Pi is the lone human survivor. He finds himself in a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a huge Bengal tiger.The developments need not be discussed here, but rather the focus of the story is the spirit of survival that Pi possesses. His ingenious methods of learning to coexist with the ferocious tiger force us to consider what the human race has done to nature in too many regards to count. Pi's religious spirit and insightful ways, coupled with a very specific survival guide, lead him to maneuver 227 days adrift in the Pacific. In the process, we are treated to some of the most spectacular visuals ever seen on screen. At times the sea, and its sea life and sky, are phosphorescent. The story is so amazing that we find ourselves not caring how much is real and how much is caused by Pi's hunger and thirst. Some of the visual effects are tranquil, while others are quite violent. A sequence featuring flying silver fish is something to behold.The structure of the story is such that an adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is re-telling the tale of survival to a Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). While this is a traditional story-telling device, it takes nothing away from the anything but traditional story of Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's name). We are told ""This is a story that will make you believe in God"". Whether it does or it doesn't, it certainly makes us believe in the magic of movies.Some will compare to Castaway, while others will think of 127 Hours. My best advice is to let go and give yourself to the story and the film. There is always time afterwards for debate and discussion. Instead, enjoy the moment and be thankful that a movie like this can get made ... it will lead the industry to even more creative productions down the road. So, just this once, forget what I have said many times, and go see this one in 3D. Allow it to take you away.","

"Turfseer","27 December 2012","Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who his father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.In the end, the Life of Pi 'main course' will be remembered for Pi's 'story #1' and Ang Lee's masterful visual presentation. The rest, including the lumbering narration, simplistic spiritual stance and ambiguous alternative ending, are the leftovers.","

"harry_tk_yung","2 December 2012","The story proper is book-ended between the scenes of a writer's (Rafe Spall) interview of the protagonist Pi, adult version (Irrfan Khan), which serve also as VO narration. Within this ""story proper"", the key segment that happens on a lifeboat drifting on the Pacific is further sandwiched between what happens before and after. ""Before"" show traces Pi's life early childhood (Gautam Belur) to teenager (Suraj Sharma) when financial difficulties forces his parents to close the zoo they were operating and embark on a family voyage to the U.S. together with the animals which they hope to sell upon arrival. ""Just like Columbus"", his father explained, to which Pi replied in a muffled voice ""But Columbus was looking for India"". ""After"" recounts the incidents after drifting in the Ocean for 227 days, hitting land for the first time (just an island) and eventually finding rescue at the coast of Mexico. Quite obviously, the ""key segment"" of drifting in the Pacific, which takes about an hour, is the highlight. But is must be said the 2-hour film is mesmerizing in its entirety.This centre masterpiece is to be enjoyed on two levels: visual and spiritual. There can never been enough said to do justice to the visual wonder Ang Lee has created, utilizing 3D in a way never used by anyone else before, to create beauty, especially when it comes to water. The spiritual context is so rich that the film arguably compels multiple viewing. Much has been elaborated by critics on the theme of divinity that transverse cultures. Similarly is the universal theme of valuing what you have, and reaching out to communicate your appreciation before it's too late. Most insightful is Pi's OV comment that the Bengal tiger, notwithstanding being a constant threat to his life, is in fact the most important reason for his survival of the 227 days. Here we are talking about loneliness. This fellow being has become Pi's reason for living, initially to stay away from its murderous claws, but later to caring for its every need from food to fresh water.A lesser director would have grabbed the many opportunities for sappy tear manipulation, which would be beneath Ang Lee. The scene showing the parting of Pi and Richard Parker the tiger alone will be reflected on for a long time.","

"MovieNewsAndUpdates","25 November 2012","Before giving any review about the movie i must request everyone to watch this movie only in a 3D format because i feel it is one of the very few of the 3d movies which retains its soul despite being in 3d format and not being a mere sales technique. Life of Pi is not a story about survival as many of viewers who have and have not read the book mentioned it already. It is not a story about a cast away. It is much more than that. It is about faith, religion, endurance and most important of all relationships. I have not read the novel on which the movie is based but yet i can be pretty sure that the movie has done almost or complete justice to it. With no intentions of watching this movie i went in expecting nothing but came out thanking the ones who took me for this movie. Ang Lee has always had an incredible ability to depict human emotions in various ways and various characters which we have seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. But in this one he goes a step beyond and creates an emotion between a human and an animal. But it just doesn't end there, he adds the flavor of perfection to the movie by giving incredible visuals. Now being stranded on a sea can be a boring script especially when you have a run time of 145 minutes but Ang Lee shows us so much in that time that you end up craving for more. With exceptional visuals and incredible performance by the lead, Life of Pi is an unforgettable movie for me and it does make me believe in God. I am sure it will succeed in making a lot of other people believe. There are unforgettable moments in the movie and it is going to be extremely difficult for anyone to pick just one. But i am sure everyone will like the last ten minute of the movie which make you think and go through the movie again. I salute Ang Lee for such a beautiful depiction of the book and portraying so many beautiful things and putting the CGI and Animation to the right use. The movie is a pure piece of Art and must not be missed under any circumstances. I would really wish to see this movie in the IMDb top 250 list","

"rebecca-ry","10 January 2013","'Life of Pi' is a story about a young man stranded on a boat in the middle of the Pacific with a tiger after the ship carrying his family and their zoo sinks. Directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), this is a spectacular film with a lot of great qualities.There's pretty much just one actor in this; Suraj Sharma makes a great debut here and I really hope his career takes off after this despite not being nominated for an Oscar unfortunately. It must be challenging being the only actor on-screen for 90% of the film with no one to converse with except a CGI tiger- Sharma handles this well though and his performance is thoroughly entertaining. Irfan Khan doesn't have much screen time but he gives a powerful performance, particularly in the last scene. Rafe Spall is a bit disappointing; he doesn't show any emotion in crucial scenes and he can take away the power and quality of a scene because of this. The exact opposite of an actors' job!I am opposed to 3D in cinema and therefore chose to see this in traditional, 'boring' 2D. Visually, it is still spectacular despite it being advertised as a film made for 3D (doesn't every 3D films' advertising campaign argue this?). The CGI animals – excluding the tiger – can look obviously fake and tacky at times which can be a bit off- putting but this is very brief. The night sequences are over the top and unrealistic but are beautiful and do somehow suit the film – Ang Lee has done well in creating the setting.Overall, this is an excellent film which is sure to do well at the Oscars. It's not really similar to any of Ang Lee's other works but it is a great film to watch and is expertly made. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the book so I can't tell if it is any better but, from what I do know about the book, I think this film tries to stay as close to it as possible.","

"TxMike","28 March 2013","""Life of Pi"" is one of those stories that get you thinking and people talking about ""what does it all mean?"" The line, near the end, where adult Pi asks the writer, ""Which story do you prefer?"" is telling, because he doesn't say ""Which story do you believe?"" This is not a story with one definite answer of what really happened on the boat, at sea for most of a year. The author of the source book doesn't even take a stand, he wrote it to be a modern day fable, a well-told yarn.I find the movie best enjoyed just by watching it and enjoying the story, and the beautiful cinematography without worrying too much about deeper meanings. It is a story about young Pi (short for Piscine) Patel who has a personal exploration with spiritual matters, and when he finds himself at sea in a lifeboat, with an adult Bengal Tiger, he uses his faith, his belief in God, to carry him through and trust in ultimate survival. And it doesn't matter if any individual viewer believes in God, only that young Pi does.Suraj Sharma is teenager Pi Patel in the 1970s, his family is forced to sell their zoo animals, all are on board a Japanese freight ship when, in a mighty storm the ship sinks, and the next morning Pi finds himself sharing the boat with an injured Zebra, a Hyea, and after a while, hiding under the tarp, Richard Parker, the adult Bengal Tiger. Eventually only Pi and Richard are left on the boat, and much of the movie is their saga of survival before eventually landing on the beach of Mexico.The movie starts and ends in modern times, with Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi Patel, a college professor living in Canada with his wife and two children. An author, Rafe Spall as the Writer , is there to learn of Pi's story and write a book. In the end as Pi tells of the Japanese representatives of the shipping line visiting him in the hospital, they found his story hard to believe. So he told them a second, different, simpler story. When the writer questions the stories, searching for an answer, Pi asks, ""Which story do you prefer?"" The author of the book things we should prefer the first story, because everyone else dies anyway, but it is a much better story.I have it on Blu-ray, the picture and sound are both just great. Definitely a movie to re-enjoy periodically.","

"because-of-him","14 April 2013","The movie is actually a 9.5 out of 10 as far as special effects, but the story plays heavily on religion and is more of a moral teaching that all religions are the same, worthless while at the same time pushes anti- religion. The man who tells the story is a very intelligent person so it is very puzzling why he cannot tell the very marked distinct differences in religions yet finds that he can worship many at the same time, a belief that is beyond belief and believability. The story would have been a perfect 10 had it left out the heavy emphasis on religion because the shipping scenes and survival portions are very believable and beautifully done, almost magical. Overall, the mocking of religion leaves some, as us, with a sense of a thorn in the flesh. While we enjoyed watching it very, very much, it is not a movie we would buy or own. It is just too politically religiously abusive.","

I was going to give a 10 rate but when I thought about The tiger being with a human for a long time and not attacking Pi, that event would very unlikely to happen so I did not buy that part of the story but yes I am agree Imagination is a part of the Creativity of this film! Well Done!So i congratulate the Director for making a movie that was easy to understand and acting was not so bad at all either!Hope I can see new films from this Director!","

"claudio_carvalho","2 March 2013","In Canada, a writer (Rafe Spall) visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father that owns a zoo tells that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States of America. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking.Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger that he called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hunger, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.""Life of Pi"" is an overrated adventure with stunning CGI. I knew that the novel of Yann Martel is a plagiarization of the ""Max e os Felinos"" (""Max and the Cats"") by the Brazilian writer Moacyr Scliar (Note: see the interview with subtitles in this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIQitu5oYWw) .But the storyline is a rip-off of ""Hell in the Pacific"" and ""Enemy Mine"", with two enemies trapped in the same space, entwined with ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Cast Away"" and magnificent visual effects. The impressive marketing justifies the hype surrounding ""Life of Pi"". When Pi tells the true story of the wreckage, the magic is gone. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""As Aventuras de Pi"" (""The Adventures of Pi"")","

"robinwoodpdx","23 November 2012","LIFE OF PI is an odyssey that has everything: love, danger, exotic locations, swimming with tigers, and the three major world religions. It is a staggering, nearly all-encompassing metaphor for life. It will strengthen your faith in God. And it is infused with beauty throughout, via director Ang Leeahhh.I think there are two ways you could take the story: first, as a kind of magical tall tale; second, as something quite a bit deeper--i.e., not superficial entertainment, but profound testimony by an overcomer in life. I'm guessing that people who are deep and have been through a lot of difficulties in their lives will probably get much more out of this movie, whereas others might not relate to or perhaps even recognize the subtext in it (and oh, how much they will miss!!!).It isn't necessary to read the book first, although it is marvelously well written. Rarely do I think a movie so good that I see it twice in 2 days, and I will go see it a third time soon--don't miss it on the big screen!!MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!","

"Red_Identity","30 November 2012","Let's get this out of the way. I did not see this in 3-D, so I will not talk about how amazing the 3-D was. In that respect, perhaps I am able to judge the film in its own right. The story here isn't anything too different. We've had survival stories of this kind before. The film is also told as one man's recollection, and I always have a problem with this technique. It always sort of drags the film down, because instead of you being immersed in the actual story being told, films always do some back-and-forths with the story and the character recollecting the story. This film is no exception, and it kinda falls into that same trap of cheese and over-sentimentality at times. This isn't a subtle film in any way, and it's more obvious in the present scenes.Getting that out of the way, this is a truly beautiful film in every respect. The message is clear, but powerful, and on a visual level this is masterful. The cinematography isn't just brilliant because the visual imagery is brilliant (and many times that's all people think of cinematography as being) but because the sweeping scope of the photography and the many different shots create a fantastically vivid and dreamy world. Even in it's most languid scenes there's a technical mastery here not present in most films. The strongest section of the film is Pi at sea no doubt, and it's virtually perfect. However, the last 10 or 15 minutes once again cross the line where some of it just comes across corny. But I liked the purpose of where the film headed, and what the ending was for, I just wish Lee and the script hadn't hit it with so much on-the-point sentimentality.But overall, flaws and all, this is a truly fantastic film, and strongly recommended.","

"nolandalla-447-695930","28 November 2012","Life of Pi is a difficult movie to review.Certain to be one of the year's most widely-discussed films, in part because it's open to multiple interpretations, this is a bold cinematic achievement by Oscar-winning director Ang Lee.Yet, it's also fundamentally flawed, its most puzzling script gaps camouflaged by extraordinary special effects and first-rate performances by the actors who portray the lead character at different stages of his life. Indeed, the varied imagery and wide range of emotional demands upon the actors are so compelling that one might actually overlook the glaring contradiction within the film's most intriguing question — which deals with the storyteller's relationship with God. The film is such a powerful visual spectacle that the audience deserves an equally consistent storyline — and ultimately just as satisfying a payoff — which compliments the arduous endurance test of sitting through what feels like an overly-long 2 hour and 20 minute epic journey across the world's biggest ocean.First, the basics. ""Pi"" is an Indian boy who enjoys an almost idyllic childhood. His early years are spent in a tropical seaside paradise located on the coast of the Indian Ocean. Pi's family owns and operates a zoo with several exotic animals.When Pi becomes a teenager, his father decides to disband the zoo and move the entire family abroad. This leads to a life-changing adventure. To its credit, the story challenges many conventional assumptions about new immigrants. We assume immigrants are thrilled to be in a new homeland. But that's not always the case. After all, what child wants to be uprooted from a house near the beach, living happily among zoo animals — as is the case with Pi? I found this to be a powerful message — no doubt experienced by many very real immigrant children — which I had frankly never considered before. Sometimes, immigrants leave happy lives behind when forced to move elsewhere due to circumstances beyond their control.The family and their prized zoo animals set off to Canada, which is to become their new home. Pi and his family board a cargo ship scheduled to cross the Pacific Ocean, with several wild animals from what had been the family zoo boarded in steerage.A deadly typhoon changes everything. During the storm, Pi is thrown into an open lifeboat and is ultimately forced to survive on his own at sea. To make matters worse, but undoubtedly more interesting for the audience, some wild animals manage to find sanctuary inside the lifeboat with the terrified Pi. One of the animals that climbs aboard is a vicious Bengal tiger.The story is entirely plausible up to this point. In the interest of avoiding spoilers for those who have not seen the movie, let's just say Pi and his beastly companion end up spending many months at sea together locked in a battle for supremacy and survival. As one can imagine, the demands which would be extraordinary were Pi sailing solo are magnified tenfold by the presence of a wild beast that views everything on the boat as his next tasty meal.One thing which can be revealed is that Pi somehow manages to survive the ordeal. The story is told in flashbacks by an older and wiser Pi, ostensibly living somewhere in Canada in the present day. These segments introduce the film's most puzzling assertion.The movie includes strong religious overtones throughout. Pi's early years are spent searching for God and the right religion to join. This is a pervasive theme throughout all stages of the film — setting up the central character's most poignant moment of self-discovery. This takes place when the adult Pi, now in his early 40s, reveals to the listener that the perilous sea voyage enabled him to better know and understand God. The reflection is largely positive.Alas, Pi spends considerable time praising God as his savior at sea. After all, the necessities for survival were ultimately provided to him.And therein lies the glaring contradiction. Pi reveres the same God who essentially murdered his entire family, needlessly sent dozens of innocent animals off to a torturous and terrifying death, and transformed him into an orphan in a strange land — not to mention having to endure a terrorizing ordeal on the high seas for 227 days. If God is to be praised for providing precious food and water at opportune moments while exposed at sea for months on end, shouldn't the same divinity also bear the blame for causing so much death and misery in the first place? ""Gee God — thanks for the tuna and rainwater. I guess that's payback for drowning my giraffe, two elephants, plus my mom and dad."" Moreover, the beautiful imagery becomes something of a distraction. Several short interludes interrupt Pi's struggle at sea, which show off a kaleidoscope of splendor. Unfortunately, these scenes in no way serve to advance the story nor answer any of the fundamental questions and judgments which Pi is entitled to make following his experience.Life of Pi is not a film for children. It's being promoted as an action-adventure with a boy as the star, and various animals as the supporting cast. But these are not Disney animals. They are wild beasts capable of killing in an instant. There are several scenes of savagery, which left may children screaming and crying in the showing I attended. For those expecting to see Beauty and the Beast at sea, think again.In summation, this is a spectacular cinematic achievement, which will undoubtedly be rewarded at Oscar time. Deservedly so.Everyone will take away something different away from this movie. My interpretation is that life — even when filled with the prospect of danger and death — can be mesmerizing, even beautiful. However, as a spiritual awakening, this is a movie which cannot be rescued. That message remains aimlessly adrift at sea.www.nolandalla.com","

"DubhDoo","9 March 2013","In a manner somewhat similar to the recent adaptation of David Mitchell's 'Cloud Atlas', 'Life of Pi' shouldn't work. Based on the award-winning and widely-lauded 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel, it chronicles the life-changing maritime adventure of a young Indian boy humorously named Piscine or ""Pi"" for short, who after a surviving the sinking of a ship, ends up on a lifeboat, with a hyena, an orang-utan, a zebra and of course, a large Bengal tiger called Richard Parker (a moniker that came about wittily). Consequently, the book came to considered 'unfilmmable' (and for just cause), yet the world of cinema's interest in Martel's wonderful novel remained undying and after much development the proposed adaptation eventually landed at the feet of the excellent Ang Lee. Despite Lee's having proved himself to be a director of considerable talent, with superb offerings like 'The Ice Storm' and 'Brokeback Storm', themselves both adaptations, it was doubtful whether or not the much-loved novel would translate successfully to the big screen. Many other accomplished directors have failed to capture similarly ambitious novels in film form, such as David Lynch's folly that was 'Dune'. Any worry has turned out to be unnecessary though as the Taiwanese filmmaker has delivered a beautiful and moving film that is easily one of his finest works yet. There's no denying that 'Life of Pi' is filled with visual beauty, as in teaming up with DoP Claudio Miranda, Lee has utilised the film's ocean setting like an impressionistic artist to a blank canvas. Even though it is a scene that has done the rounds in the film's trailers, the night- set scene where the whale leaps out of the water is a thing of breathtaking majesty. Similarly, there are numerous moments that are nothing short of gorgeous in a way that could see even Terrence Malick become envious. Adding to this, the use of CGI is one of the most remarkable in recent years, exemplified with the meticulous detail put into Richard Parker, which renders him a significant achievement in CGI, as it becomes rather difficult to tell when the tiger is real or not.Yet, it's worth noting that this is a film that resonates on an emotional level as well as a technical. From the moment proceedings kicked off, I was engrossed in Pi's story, with its smooth fluidity, whether I was looking at Irrfan Khan or Suraj Sharma. The latter, a first time actor, delivers a great and at times subtle performance as the titular character, consistently helping me to engage with Pi and ultimately, like him. Even as he was simply sitting upon a raft in silence, I still couldn't help but find myself enthralled in the journey he had (unwillingly) embarked on.'Life of Pi' is a wonderful film, bursting with imagination and in love with the possibilities of storytelling, which sees Ang Lee wield 3-D expertly, forgoing the usual gimmicky 'things leaping out of the screen' and instead adding more depth and texture to the colourful cinematography. It's not just a technical marvel, but a true wonder all round, because the fact that Martel's novel actually works (rather well, at that) as a film is quite a miracle, and for Ang Lee should applauded.","

"chatless46","25 November 2012","On its face, this is a ripping yarn about survival at sea, based on a novel by Canadian Yann Martel. The book version is astonishing, and the film version is literally jaw-dropping both because of its visual effects and because of its faithfulness to the source material.The novel blurs the line between ""fact"" and fiction, beginning with the author's note describing his pursuit of a good story, a pursuit that lands him in Pondicherry, India. There he hears of a tale that, he is told, is God-affirming. The protagonist and narrator of the story, a native Pondicherrian by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel, now lives in Martel's homeland. Martel returns to find him in Toronto. This is where the film begins, and pretty much continues in lockstep with the book.The story supposedly told to Martel by Pi Patel unfolds intriguingly from his childhood in India to his voyage at sea with his family, through tragedy and finally, to salvation. The story is infused with humor, horror, beauty, and seamanship, all aided by stunningly vivid images. At the end, the viewer and the author face a choice that may affirm theism in some, and yet allow nonbelievers to reject it.What is hard to reject is the unutterable beauty and flash of the story, and the skillful way director Ang Lee has captured it on film. Convincing performances by Suraj Sharma as the teenage Pi and Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi are stellar. No less convincing is the rendition of leading feline Richard Parker, a creation that may make you wonder where digital technology is leading us.Most movies, and fiction in general, require suspension of disbelief. In that sense, ""Life of Pi"" can be a challenge. That said, this film breaks new ground as terrific entertainment.","

"Stskyshaker","25 November 2012","Through a movie with minimum human interaction.. Ang Lee shows humanity in its purest form.Through the incredible co-survival of a man and a Bengal tiger, Life of Pi shows us how both hopes and fears keep us going.The visual is simply groundbreaking. For moments I almost thought I was hallucinating. Many of the scenes were shot Planet Earth (the most expensive nature documentary) style, but only more stunning, in 3D, and woven together by a strong character and a beautiful story.But visual effects is far from being the only thing that makes Life of Pi extraordinary. Life of Pi is such an all-round hit. Authentic and not over-the-top acting, smooth storytelling, engrossing score.. all in all it struck me as a masterpiece not only made by masters, but also with a heart.I couldn't be more glad to celebrate this as my 700th movie on IMDb. Hope, as is Life of Pi's tagline, is what it gives me. Can't wait for Ang Lee's next movie.","

"januaryman-1","23 November 2012","Life of Pi is stunning, beautiful, and philosophical with a tantalizing lack of absolute resolution. The movie is a visual masterpiece. I gasped at many of the images contained within it. (See it on a big screen.) I know the Pi contains a mix of digital artistry and live action, but, for the life of me, I could not see the seams between them.The only problem I had with the film was that I had difficulty understanding the accented English at times. This decreased as the story progresses and I grew more accustomed to the Indian cadence. Speaking of India, Life of Pi gives a vision of an India that I had never pictured.What I believed would be the ending of a bittersweet story was turned on end by a late twist artfully introduced to remove any hint of contrivance. It was impossible to have dry eyes by the end of Life of Pi, and the last few minutes of the film will have me thinking about it for months or years or maybe the rest of my life.This movie has my vote for best picture of the year as well as a half-dozen other awards.","

Probably Ang Lee's directing made me want to see how it works, but it turned out very amazing. The film is not perfect, you can see some goofs in it. It is a sight feast in terms of pictures. The whole story and journey that Pi had been through is well told, and at last Pi told a different story, which really made me think about things around us. Many times what we believed is perhaps not the truth...but when we find something that is worth to believe, we shouldn't let it go even if we may lose everything we cared about, they will come back eventually...Anyway, it is really a good movie, worth to watch!","

"castostarlight","29 January 2013","I'm going to go ahead and say it outright. This film flat out takes the cake for the most overrated film of the year. This is unwarranted and uninspired Oscar bate on a Hurt Locker level. For the first time in a very long time I have actually left a movie feeling I had wasted my money.You all know the plot. A boy finds himself adrift at sea with a dangerous tiger after a horrific shipwreck. At the start of the film we are subjected to a meandering and drawn-out set up for themes and characters that do not even see a reprise or conclusion before the end of the film. It really felt like this film was stretching every scene and concept to a breaking point to fill the three hour artistic precedent established by previous Oscar winners like Return of the King. It just drags and drags until we are finally privy to the main plot. But then, the films biggest problem comes to a head: the theme.The film's theme cannot even be adequately described as it lacks any focus or objectivity. It simply comes off as an overbearing theistic agenda slathered onto an unrelated story. It presents itself as a lesson about faith, but doesn't convey this message in any other fashion than saying ""I had faith and I survived, therefore you should have faith."" As a critical thinker, I simply counter the point by demonstrating that if a faithless person was put in the same position as the main character and made the same decisions (since none of these decisions were based his faith) they would have identical outcomes. There in lies the problem: the lesson is not demonstrated through means of the story or character progression. It is literally told to you every few scenes via frequent and uninspired narration. The first rule in screen writing is a simple one: Show, don't tell. After all, film is a visual medium. Apparently the screenwriter missed the memo.What else is there to say? The acting was wooden. The score was big but not memorable. The only thing I can give to the film's credit is some beautiful cinematography and an effective use of 3D. But presentation is all for naught if the story is ineffective, and Life of Pi never once managed to grab me, move me or convince me of anything. It serves only as a colossal waste of money and time; my own and Hollywood's.","

"neil-476","28 December 2012","Young Indian lad Pi (telling his story in flashback) finds himself stranded in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger in the middle of the Pacific.The book simply didn't appeal to me. The trailers did, however, so off I went to take in Ang Lee's latest offering, a strange affair telling a story which falls midway between mythology, Baron Munchausen, and a Reader's Digest True-Life Adventure.To be honest, the story, such as it is, is almost inconsequential, albeit quite enough to hold the interest throughout, and certainly sufficient to hang the stunning visuals on. I think the author may well have been aiming to stimulate some sort of spiritual or philosophical musings in his audience. This film never achieved that with me - I am simply too shallow and rooted in material reality - but I was blown away by how visually stunning this film is, and I recommend it heartily on that basis alone. There came a point when I - quite literally - suddenly became aware that my mouth was hanging open.Also, see this in 3D. It is one of a handful of films where 3D is an essential part of the experience of appreciating the movie.","

I have not read the novel so i did not actually know what its all about when I walked into the theater and was pleasantly surprised at so many insinuations & portrayals of the Indian way of thinking of universal brotherhood. Ang Lee keeps the things in a different realm of reality which we all acknowledge does exist but perhaps are afraid to ""test the waters"" since we as human beings are conformists by nature and can not leave our ""comfort zone"" to think things in a way they should be thought of .......this is exactly why the director succeeds in drawing our attention to small but significant things which need to be understood to make the path more worthy of further discovery......Truly world class cinema with great acting and I will not hesitate in adding that the ""tiger"" who plays Richard Parker does deserve an Oscar this season .........","

"morrison-dylan-fan","4 January 2013","Having been introduced to Ang Lee with his magical 2000 film Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,which was also my first ever none-English language movie,I was thrilled to hear that for his next movie,Lee was planning to do something pretty special in 3D.Taking a look for some basic details about the film online,I began to fear that Lee may have strayed into the plodding Castaway territory,due to a good amount of the movie taking place between two characters being stranded in the middle of an ocean.Doing my best to lower the sense of doubt I had as I entered the cinema,I began to set to witness Ang Lee cast the life of Pi Patel in shimmering 3D across the screen.View on the film:Introduceing a religious element very early on in his adaptation of Yann Martel's novel, (with Patel being a Hindu-Catholic,who also teaches Kabbalah at a university)screenwriter David Magee (whose last credit was for being a co-writer of 2008's Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day) handles the religious themes of the story with a real delicacy that never becomes overpowering or too preachy.Using Pi's multiple religious beliefs as a way to show a holding of faith and hope in a seemingly dyer situation,and also connecting Patel's experience's to mythological religious tales,with Magee superbly showing at the end,that the most outlandish of Pi's story,is actually the one which gets the points of his life across in the best way.Setting 90% of the film in the confined location of a life boat,and also having one of the two main characters be a tiger (!),Magee brilliantly avoids the easy trappings of the movie becoming a very dry affair,by using the changing conditions of the enviorment as a way to expertly show the rites of passage that Pi is going through.along with the conditions,Magee also gives the movie an unexpected,pleasing Comedy element which helps to show the bond which develops between Patel and Richard Parker.Keeping away from using 3D as a device to poke the audience in the eye with,director Ang Lee instead uses 3D as a way to draw the audience deep into Pi's world,with the scenes of Richard Parker possibly ""turning"" on Pi having a real dept of field,and Lee's use of elegant,long wide shots creating a strong,mystical atmosphere for the isolated world that Patel finds himself in.Taking a look online for info about the making of this stunning film,I was shocked to discover,that along with the film being lead by the debut actor Suraj Sharma as the 16 year old Patel (with Irrfan Khan giving a great performance as the adult Pi) Sharma co-star,the tiger Richard Parker,was almost completely CGI!Displaying no signs at all of tearing the movie at the seems,the CGI effects of Richard Parker blend seamlessly into the envioment,with the interaction,and developing relationship between Pi and Parker looking astonishingly life-like and completely photo realistic. Getting some pretty tough challenges put in front of him,which include being the lead star in his debut performance,and also having to act with a co-star who does not exist,Suraj Sharma gives a brilliant,eye-catching debut performance as the 16 year old PI .Showing the fear and hurt that Pi feels over seeing his parents die,Sharma expertly portrays in subtle gestures the changes that take place with Pi during his experience,that go from being closed in and fearing the unknown,to opening up,and allowing the viewer to be a part of the life of Pi Patel.","

"howard.schumann","9 December 2012","According to Yann Martel, author of the Booker Prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi, ""If your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you."" In the film version of Life of Pi, the fearful opponent is a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker (explained in the film) and its worthy adversary is a teenage boy (Suraj Sharma) trapped in a lifeboat in the middle of an unforgiving ocean. For Pi, fear is the ingredient that is both his enemy and the friend that keeps him alive and helps him to maintain his faith.Directed by Ang Lee and adapted for the screen by David Magee, the film is an adventure story in the mold of Robinson Crusoe, a testament of faith, and a philosophical Rubik's Cube that will keep you awake pondering its meaning. Whatever meaning you ultimately bring to it, the film is a sumptuous visual experience that combines a dazzling combination of state-of- the-art 3-D and CGI technology to breathtaking effect. The adventure is framed by the adult Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) relating his incredible story to a Canadian journalist (Rafe Spall), sent by a friend to listen to a story that ""would make him believe in God."" As a young boy Piscine Molitor Patel (Ayush Tandon), the son of a zoo keeper in Pondicherry, India, shortens his name to Pi to avoid being teased at school. Pi is a spiritual seeker who attracted to Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity and has even studied the Jewish Kabala. Pi's embracing of all non-conflicting religions is rejected by his parents whose philosophy is secular, and his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) challenges his son to make hard choices in life. ""Believing in everything,"" he says, ""is the same as believing in nothing,"" Santosh is a hard taskmaster who graphically demonstrates, after Pi attempt to feed the Bengal tiger in their zoo, that wild animals are not your friend and will kill you without a moment's hesitation.Unfortunately, hard times fall on the family and Santosh must sell the zoo and take the family and some of the animals to Winnipeg, Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship. When an unforeseen storm batters the vessel, all members of Pi's family and the ship's crew are lost at sea. Pi is the only survivor and clings to a lifeboat accompanied by a hyena, an orangutan, and the huge cat, Richard Parker, who climb aboard. The young Pi witnesses the survival of the fittest and soon finds himself alone in the middle of the ocean with a ferocious tiger. The terror of the shipwreck is made real in a visceral 3-D experience of the raging water, thundering in surround sound.The central portion of the film depicts the day-to-day effort of the boy to tame the tiger and provide enough food for both to survive their over 200-day ordeal. The magic of technology produces beauty as well as terror in scenes of the ocean at night with the boat wandering alone beneath the stars, a cadre of flying fish, luminescent jellyfish, and a leaping whale. Whether or not you believe that the boy is really in danger aboard a boat with a man-eating tiger does not detract from the sublime feeling of connection with nature that the scenes engender. To add a surreal aspect to the adventure, the two companions find themselves on a strange floating island overrun by a colony of African mongoose known as meerkats that allows Pi to gather more food for his return to the sea.While the film's coda puts a slight damper on what we have just seen, the questions it raises are central to the film's message. Contrary to the opening invitation to the writer to research Pi's story because it would ""make him believe in God,"" Martel says that, ""God is not IN the story, but that God IS the story,"" and challenges the viewer to choose which story to believe, the one we have experienced for almost two hours or the alternative story that Pi tells Japanese insurance investigators. According to the author, ""Stories are important, because everything is in how we perceive it and nothing is really real until we say it is, so why not choose the better story?"" In my view, what Martel is saying is not that we should choose the better story because it provides a palliative by keeping pesky reality away, but because it offers the context for a richer experience of life. Did the Hanukkah candles really burn for eight days without oil? Did the Buddha really live? Did Christ? We can never know for certain, but ultimately it may not matter if the impact of the stories can lead us to a true spiritual experience, one that is touched by love whether or not we believe it or have a Bengal tiger along for the ride.","

"DarkVulcan29","25 November 2012","An Indian Teenager named Pi is lost at sea, on a life boat, with a man hungry tiger named Richard Parker. Pi does what it takes to survive, while trying not to be eaten. Will Pi keep his faith, and make it through this ordeal? Ang Lees direction is brilliant, so was the teenager playing Pi. The movie makes you feel that your lost at sea with the character. And the tiger is also good, I'm wondering what parts CGI. Although it does drag in spots, too the point where I was dozing a little, but it then it picks up. I think this is the best film of 2012, I hope it won't be missed by the Oscars. If they do miss it, well it's there loss.","

"JamesHitchcock","15 January 2013","The central character in this film is Piscine Molitor Patel, named for some reason after a swimming pool in Paris even though his family are from Pondicherry in India. As a boy, young Piscine Molitor, tired of being taunted with the nickname ""Pissing Patel"" by his schoolmates, changes his name to ""Pi"" after the mathematical symbol. Yes, it's that sort of a film. As the film opens Pi Patel is now an adult living in Montreal, Canada. He is approached by a local writer who believes that Pi's life story would make a great subject for a book. Pi therefore relates that life story to him, so most of the film consists of one long flashback. We learn of his childhood in Pondicherry, where his father owns a zoo. Most of the story, however, takes place when Pi is 16. His father decides to emigrate with the family to Canada, and closes the zoo. He books a passage to Canada on a Japanese freighter, taking all his animals with him on the ship, as he believes that he will get a better price for them in North America than in India. Halfway across the Pacific the ship is wrecked in a storm, and Pi is the only survivor. He manages to struggle onto a lifeboat but finds he must share it with several animals- a zebra, an orangutan, a spotted hyena and a Bengal tiger.The film is notable for its use of computer-generated digital imagery to render the animals, especially the tiger, and the technological aspects are certainly most impressive. The scenes in the lifeboat could, clearly, not have been filmed with real animals, but the ""virtual"" animals we see are so realistically done that we are persuaded to suspend our disbelief. The film is also, at times, visually very beautiful, as one might expect from Ang Lee, the director of that poetic ballet ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Lee's poetic vision is seen most clearly in the scenes set at sea, particularly the one where the entire ocean seems to be covered with jellyfish shining in the moonlight. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi is clearly a promising newcomer, although I was less impressed by Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi, and there is a brief but memorable cameo from Gérard Depardieu as a vulgar, racist ship's cook. My main problem with the film was that I could not really see the point of it. It was clearly intended as something more than just an exciting yarn about a shipwreck; indeed, it does not work particularly well as an adventure film because the non-realistic elements keep getting in the way. A film with a hero who is named after both a swimming pool and a mathematical symbol, who miraculously survives a considerable period of time in a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger and who encounters a mysterious floating island populated by carnivorous plants and meerkats- creatures native to southern Africa, not Pacific islands- is obviously not intended to be realistic. It must have some hidden meaning. But what is it?There is a religious note running through the film. Pi's father is a free-thinking rationalist, but Pi himself is deeply religious- so much so that he follows three religions, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, all at once. The ship on which the family travels is, although Japanese, named the Tsimtsum, a Hebrew word with a technical meaning in Jewish theology. Pi tells the writer who is interviewing him that he has a story that will ""make you believe in God"", but the implications of this are never really thought through. A story which is not only fictitious but also fantastic seems a curious argument for the existence of God. Even if one were to be confronted with a story like Pi's which was undoubtedly true, one could always choose to regard his seemingly miraculous survival as being due purely to good fortune rather than to divine intervention.I have not read Yann Martel's original novel, but to judge from this adaptation it would appear to be a work of ""magic realism"", a literary genre which combines the realistic with the fantastic, and which often works better on the printed page than on the cinema screen. There have been many notable literary works in this genre in recent decades, but few have been successfully adapted for the cinema, and the few great ""magic realist"" films, such as Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", have generally been based on original screenplays. Bille August made a very decent version of Isabel Allende's ""The House of the Spirits"", but he did so by concentrating on the realist elements in Allende's novel at the expense of the magic ones. ""Life of Pi"" is technically very impressive, and it has some excellent individual scenes, but it never really unites these into a coherent work of art. 6/10","

"view_and_review","20 January 2022","It could be said that ""Life of Pi"" is a combination of ""Cast Away"" and ""Open Water."" I would stay away from such a simplistic equation especially since pi is in the title of the aforementioned movie. ""Life of Pi"" is so much more than ""Cast Away"" in ""Open Water,"" it has its own identity, its own essence which makes it uniquely different from the other two, and not just because of the tiger.Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan) had a fantastical story. He and his family were caught on a sinking ship in the middle of the Pacific while traveling from India to Canada. Everyone on the ship died except Pi who made it to a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger. In short order it was just Pi and the tiger battling the elements and battling each other for survival, while also battling each other for supremacy.This was a dramatic movie with a set as colorful as the main character. Visually, this movie is stunning and it keeps the viewer engaged. You'll feel like you've experienced a lifetime of drama though Pi was in the open sea far less than that.Ang Lee lost me after ""Hulk"" and I didn't watch another movie of his until ""Gemini Man"" which was simply OK. I don't see myself jumping on the Ang Lee train because of ""Life of Pi,"" but it is at least a little redemptive.","

"KineticSeoul","29 November 2012","So this is a movie based on a novel, now video game movie adaptations doesn't seem to work a lot of times. But it works from novel to movies sometimes and I haven't even read the book. But it seemed like this is a great adaptation. Now I wasn't even excited for this movie or anything, when I saw the first trailer I didn't even know what this movie was about. It just showed a guy and a tiger on a boat. This kinda seemed like ""127 Hours"" and ""Castaway"" combined kinda. But it is a more meaningful movie that has some deep messages to go with it. Now this is a family movie but youngsters probably won't be entertained much by this but for the adults that like psychological and spiritual movies just might dig this one. I can't really say I was very entertained throughout this whole movie, some parts seemed a bit slow for me. But this is just one of those movies you might have to ponder upon about after seeing it to know why it's a great movie. The cinematography is just vivid and beautiful to watch even if it's mostly nature. Most of the running time is taken up while showing the relationship between Pi Patel and a tiger and they are both stranded on a boat. And I especially liked how it didn't go in a far-fetched direction but you can actually buy into the relationship between Pi and the tiger. Overall this is a great movie that is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of action or laugh out loud comedy. Although there are some witty and cute comedic parts in this movie. Without giving the ending away it leaves it up to the audience to choose. Although some might like the message and other won't.8.2/10","

"andrewchristianjr","19 January 2021","Astonishing and quite unique due to it's incredible effects for the animals and transitions. THE LIFE OF PI captures the sadness of losing the ones you love too fast. This story was never going to be put into film, but the director has done the best of what he was given. He and the producers did an outstanding job with the effects as well! As for the originality, never have you seen this before.","

"griffolyon12","30 November 2012","Within the first ten minutes, the titular protagonist of Life of Pi, Pi Patel, tells a writer that this story will make one believe in God. The story that Pi tells, is that of a shipwreck, which claims a teenaged Pi's family. Amidst the chaos, he found himself the sole human survivor, now floating across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Part survival story, part rumination about one person's faith and their attempts at understanding why God designed nature to do the things in which it does, Life of Pi is an emotion-filled journey that places the viewer within these events and has them pondering the same questions that the film's lead, newcomer Suraj Sharma, does.In a great many ways, Life of Pi requires an open mind from its viewers. It is not a film about one particular religion, as Pi is a combination Hindu, Catholic, and Muslim. He has always been fascinated by God, whether it be Christ, the many Hindu Gods, or Allah, Pi believes they're all the same. The film does not ask the viewer to believe this same idea as Pi, his beliefs simply serve as the impetus to understanding the gentle, soul-filled character that is Pi Patel, and understand how a 16-year-old boy could survive not just the elements and starvation, but also a man-eating tiger.The set up of the film is filled with life and energy, detailing the source of Pi's name, his fascination with religion, and his loss of innocence, before the ship wrecks and the real story begins -- Pi's journey to understand God. To his immense credit, young actor, Suraj Sharma, manages to hold the film together thanks to his revelatory performance. Sharma is the heart- and-soul of Life of Pi. He has a wide range of emotions that make him believable as a teen pondering such large questions, keeping the viewer engaged rather than allowing their attention span to wane. Which is good, seeing as how Life of Pi gets narratively murky around the midpoint, with some of the confrontations between Pi and nature running together by that point. Thankfully, the thematic ideas are what I feel that Ang Lee and company want the audience to take away from the film, and the emotions and ideas are so strong, it is very easy to overlook its narrative shortcomings.Visually, Life of Pi is a marvel. The animals in the life boat are entirely computer generated, and there are many moments where it is hard to find the glossy edges that CGI leaves behind. As well, director Ang Lee uses visual effects and the camera's depth of field to create a more immersive, dream-like feel. Almost every shot seems to have been digitally altered to make it seem more unreal, to make the water more reflective, to make the sky more beautiful, or to make dream and reality often collide. In particular, the way that the camera was always focused on Pi, with most of the other actors out of focus, it really draws one into Pi's state. However, I cannot figure out why Lee changed the aspect ratio in a few scenes. There is no evidence in the film itself to suggest why, leaving me confused. It's only for two scenes, and both are scenes meant to be emotional beats, and yet the film goes from widescreen to fullscreen to letterbox format. It jars the viewer and takes one out of the filmgoing experience.All in all, Life of Pi is not perfect, but it was a film I do not regret seeing. Thanks to a strong performance from Sharma, marvelous effects work, luscious visuals, and a thematic consistency that never falters in affecting the viewer, Life of Pi is a flawed, yet must see film that will be nominated come Oscar night.I give Life of Pi an 8 out of 10","

"aharmas","2 December 2012","We live in an era of cinema where it's very difficult to feel fulfilled with contemporary movies. There is some dissatisfaction about how the emphasis is on special effects and more than often the script is weak in comparison. Also, some people associate only serious themes with quality, and we can't help but wonder why we seem to place so much weight on period/costume movies while evaluating films. Thankfully we have people like Ang Lee who will not put a film together if the elements don't fit. With the exception of the ""Hulk"" which looks right and has a good story, yet it didn't quite match his other accomplishments, and he has tried just about every genre in cinema.Here he gives us what could be his absolute masterpiece, ""The Life of Pi"" a film that works in so many levels: it's entertaining, wondrous, a metaphor for faith and the power of life, for just about every feeling we can think of or feel. It is so powerful that every single frame and line in it has a purpose and grabs our attention in a gentle and yet, sure way. Once the film begins, you can't look away or engage in any other thoughts, and all sorts of annoying technology (other than the one in the screen) is forgotten. As a member of the audience, you want this superb piece of imagery and storytelling to continue charming you, teaching you, getting inside your head, heart and soul.Pi tells his amazing survival story to another man, a writer I believe, and the beginning of the film provides the background of a young man who believes in spirituality and searches for answers from early. Later on, as the story takes him across the world, his beliefs and faith will be tested in several incredible ways. Pi is from India, and he has a connection to living beings and other spiritual entities. His family doesn't quite understand his hunger, but his mothers tells the others to allow to pursue what he feels is right.As they decide to move to Canada, tragedy strikes their ship, and Pi finds himself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with a few animals that managed to escape from the cargo holds. His odyssey, with Mr. Lee's amazing control of every possible film element, from one of the most sensational pieces of editing, some magical cinematography, sound effects, and a lovely music score, we learn, as he does that there are a few miracles out there, and most of the times, encountering them is a test of the soul.Most of the interaction is between him and Richard Parker, a Bengali tiger that has as much will to live as Pi does. Lee has filmed some unbelievable scenes, and I am still in awe about the way he did accomplish this. It's either the wonders of great editing, some quite sensational computer graphic imagery, or just plain terrific direction by Lee.Pi and Parker's main goal is to survive, and they start by outsmarting each other and proving their worth, claiming territoriality, and giving us some thrilling and at times, very funny and scary exchanges. Eventually, as the story reaches its last sections, we see another type of link develop, and a film that is certainly qualifying as a wonderful movie from its beginning has now soared into greatness. The audience must be ready to gasp, and choke as powerful expressions, sometimes wordless acting force us into looking into our own emotions. Tears will inevitable roll out as you witness beauty rarely shown in movies. ""Pi"" is surely one of the best films ever made, an instant classic, and a reflection into humanity, those entities we choose to guide us through our human trek in this world. Whether or not you believe its message, can relate to its ideas or just enjoy its execution is entirely up to you. It does offer an interesting choice at it concludes. You decide. Either way, it will move you.","

"The-Sarkologist","14 May 2013","They said that this was the unfilmable book, and, well, this and countless of other films also fall into that category (such as Cloud Atlas, which I plan on holding off seeing until I get around to actually reading the book, though I have since seen it because I could watch it on the plane), and I would also suggest that maybe books like Ulysses and To the Lighthouse also fall into that category (I know they have made a film out of To the Lighthouse, but since I am writing this at 38000 ft and have no internet access, I cannot comment on Ulysses – yep, they have).For those who have not seen this film, you will know it as the film about the boy who is trapped in a life boat with a tiger. Actually, many of you that have seen this film will probably say the same thing, I know I will. In fact, it is amusing sitting on the plane and looking around at the other seats to see who else is watching it (and the fact that I am stuck in this flying coffin for eight hours, I might as well watch it, but I do draw the line at Cloud Atlas – which I ended up watching anyway, and quite enjoyed it). Anyway, enough of me rambling, let us talk about the film.Visually it is beautiful, but having never read the book I cannot comment on whether it actually catches the themes of the book all that well. Based on the film, and the story that is told at the end, I suspect it is about how one struggles with one's animal instincts and the desire to remain human. When trapped alone, out of touch with the rest of humanity, it is believed that one will no doubt descend back into an animal nature.It is an interesting thought though, that the only thing that keeps us civilised is the existence of other people. The reason I raise this thing is because there are two stories, and one of them involves the boy stuck in the boat with the tiger, but this is a metaphor, in a sense. The boy is, well, the boy, and the tiger is the animal urges that are trying to take over the boy's mind. However, how do we know that that actually happens. Maybe there have been studies, maybe there hasn't.However it is not simply about controlling one's humanity because, in a sense, we also have a scene where boy saves the tiger's life, and we question whether that, in a sense, is his desire not to let go of his animal nature. In a way this struggle, as he says, keeps him alive. Maybe it is the case that by killing the tiger he kills himself. In a way, it could be the animal instinct finally winning, so by showing the tiger kindness, and mercy, one retain's one humanity, whereas by killing the tiger, one sinks and becomes lost in one's animal instincts.","

"miccosiamesecat","8 May 2013","First off, let me just say that I am NOT some religious nut. I a have seen the twilight movies and probably a bunch of other movies that I shouldn't be watching. I'm an adult and can sift through a movie and take away what I want and watch the rest just for entertainment value, even though I AM a Christian.That being said....this movie takes about five different religions and mixes them all together and basically says, it's okay to believe in anything you want, that everything is ALL the same and you can pick apart different ideas and make your own religion. I found that idea very disturbing and I wouldn't even mention it, except for the fact that they push this super spiritual mixture mess throughout the entire movie. I would have loved this movie if they would of left the spiritual voodoo out of the movie. Make it a simple story of overcoming the odds and finding a bonding relationship with an exotic animal that not many people will ever understand, let alone come that close to. I could believe and even respect that. Some people has special talents and gifts with animals and can understand them in ways most people can't, and the animals reciprocate that back.Enough said about the religious stuff...let me just say that the movie was pretty slow. I know that one of the main characters(aka..the tiger) doesn't have dialogue and so you have to rely on the animals body language to do the talking for you. There was one part towards the end of the movie(don't want to give it away) where I thought I was having an acid trip, the idea was so ridiculous and strange. I know this is supposed to be a deep spiritual and slightly(and I emphasize slightly) philosophical type movie, but that wasn't what I was expecting to get out of this movie and towards the end, it just got ridiculous. Not to mention, I hated the way things ended up with the boy and the tiger and the ending of the actual movie was very boring and anticlimactic.I like deep...deep thoughts, ideas...I can do deep in my sleep, but this movie was just weird on every level and is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This COULD have been a really great movie if they would of kept it simple...boy bonds with tiger and overcomes all odds...no mumbo jumbo wonky stuff.That's my two cents anyway...","

"jtindahouse","18 February 2013","Just before I left to see Life of Pi my cat had found a mouse in the garage. It got me to thinking about the food chain and the frailty of life. But it also got me to thinking about why we value one life so differently from the next. Something as simple as the size of an animal can determine how much we care for that animal. No one gives it a second thought if they find a mouse dead in the street, but if they come across a giraffe or an elephant, (which probably have a fifth of the character) in the same state, it'll bother them to no end. It was an amazing coincidence for me then, when the movie had an element of these themes about it too. It took it even further making us question one's faith and even questioning the legitimacy of what we've just seen.Life of Pi is told from the point of view of the main character Pi Patel, many years after he was the survivor of a sunken ship and spent 227 days at sea accompanied by a ferocious tiger. The story has a lot of similarities with Cast Away, the most obvious probably being the sole relationship of an unexpected companion. In Cast Away it was a volleyball, here it is a tiger. While it is a necessary plot device to have these ""characters"" in the story, it is also fascinating to see just how close and reliant the main character becomes on them. Something that I imagine would actually genuinely be the case if you were in that situation.The cinematography is astonishing throughout and seeing it in 3D (even though I'm not the biggest fan of the format) was just the icing on the cake. This is a tough film to review because it leaves itself very open to interpretation. The message boards are flooded with questions and every answer to them is unique and of a slightly different opinion. Ang Lee has done well in keeping this a talked about and debated piece of cinema. I have my own opinions on most of the questions too, but to throw them out there now would be wrong. It could lead you to come to a conclusion you wouldn't otherwise have come to and it would also ruin a bit of what is fun about the ending. Go in with an open mind, form your own opinions and then take the time to read some other people's ones too. Life of Pi can be as much fun after the film as it is during.","

"SnoopyStyle","9 November 2013","Director Ang Lee adapts the interesting Yann Martel novel. Considering all the big name directors previously attached to the project, he does an admirable job bringing this unfilmable movie to the big screen.Pi Patel lives his childhood in Pondicherry, India with his zoo owning family. Eventually they had to sell their animals to the west, and move to Canada. They travel on a Japanese freighter with the animals. The ship sinks and Pi gets to a lifeboat with a menagerie of animals including a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.Much has been said of the great CG animals. I don't need to add more to that. The lifeboat scenes look great. Ang Lee has filmed the unfilmable. I do wish the island be more otherworldly to clue in the unrealism of the story. And the island had a more religious overtone in the book which is missing here.I also wish they filmed the real lifeboat with the people characters. A visual depiction would be much more dramatic. The violence could be cut out if they needed to keep the PG rating. In fact the ratings might be why they decided to reduce that section to a simple narration.","

"arthur_tafero","10 January 2023","The very stylish film, The Life of Pi, is one of the finest modern Indian films ever made. It does not rely on silly Bollywood song and dance numbers, nor does it try to portray neorealism in the lives of common Indians (as did the master director, Satrijat Ray). It is a stand-alone film about the fantasies of a young man and his tiger; that's right, every boy should have a pet tiger. This is as different a story as you will ever see on film. The plot is a bit too convoluted to explain, so you really need to see it to understand what is going on. Visually, this film has few competitors; it really is a stunning cinematic experience. Be sure to catch it.","

"JohnRayPeterson","23 February 2013","This movies is simply enchanting and a visual spectacle to behold; it's not surprising to me that it made it to the Oscars. What is surprising, is that it made it from book to film; I could not have imagined this could be done and give the story justice. How can you bring such a wonder of imagination and well written prose to the screen? Well, Ang Lee did; his work, what I've seen of it in the past, certainly lets one to believe that he has no fear and is blessed with every author's dream, a total appreciation of their work. It was a friend, and fellow author, who lent me 'L'histoire de Pi' by Yann Martel. Nothing unusual with a local author introducing to another, the work of yet another one, except that I was not into fantasy novels. My mind has been open to it, in no small part by Martel's third literary endeavour; I can now enjoy, and boy do I, such work as Mark Lawrence's The Broken Empire, for the beauty of the style( I hope to god someone put that on film).Anyway, the life story, the fantastic part it certainly, of Piscine Molitor Patel is one that begged to be put on paper and thanks to Ang Lee also on screen. The special effects are well done and will garnish some oohs and ahs to be sure. A film the whole family can enjoy, but caution to those looking for a merry fable; it is a harsh depiction of life. I do not wish to spoil anyone's pleasure by revealing more and will simply say Go see that movie.","

I'd like to say this movie totally meet my anticipation. The animation was real and beautiful, so the scene was amazing. Some scene and action taking from different views was also impressive. This movie was pretty hot and being discussed much in my country now. Some scenes are taking in Taiwan. I did not watch the book so i can't compare between book and movie. I recommend 3D caused some view will really touch you. For kids it is alright cause some bloody scene was adjusted. I think it is more than a story, there are many points worthy of thinking. Nice try and nice working of Ang Lee!","

"dfranzen70","5 January 2013","In Life of Pi, Ang Lee's philosophical spectacle, makes for a fascinating viewing, succeeding on multiple levels of enjoyment. There's the adventure itself, a massive sojourn of a boy in a lifeboat - with a Bengal tiger. And then there's the meaning of the story itself, which is happily left ambiguous. It's also about the spirit and resourcefulness of man, and above all it's about hope and optimism. Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), named after a famous pool in France, is on his way from his home in India with his mother, father, brother, and a lot of animals (the family owns a zoo) aboard a Japanese vessel, bound for Canada. During a particularly terrifying thunderstorm, the ship sinks, and Pi finds himself on a stocked lifeboat with a few of the lucky creatures (none human) and no idea of his location.The animals are inconsequential except for one - the tiger. How does one survive in a lifeboat with an untamed beast who'd love to make a meal out of him? It's not easy, and luckily our Pi is quite resourceful. Rest assured, though, there is no silent understanding between the two, even as hunger and thirst rob each of his strength. They are not friends. They each wish to survive, although a case can be made that Pi, at least, has no intention of harming/eating the tiger.The tiger is not stupid - oh, quite the contrary, he is a cunning brute. He can't be cowed, and he won't allow Pi to have dominion over the lifeboat, which forces our human hero to construct a sort of floating annex to the boat, tethered and filled with supplies.Of great interest to me were the tantalizing, beautiful aquatic scenes. Whether it was the sight of thousands of fish flying through the air at our passengers or a glimpse into the remarkably clear water to see gorgeous - and sometimes quite large - marine life blithely swimming by, there's rarely a slow moment. Picking up the slack in such matters, of course, is how Pi survives, how he keeps his wits about him, how he manages to get by with a ravenous tiger so close by. If you think that Lee is trying to present a moralistic story to us - he touches quite a bit on religion, for example - you are right. But it's not heavy handed by any means. To illustrate this, Pi (as an adult relating his tale to a writer) notes that when he was a young lad in India, he joined up with several different religions, a way to show us that he was having trouble finding his way, choosing the right path. As his father remarks to him at dinner one night, it is fine to be different, but in the end one must choose a path. Net thing you know, Pi is afloat on a raft, drifting aimlessly across the Pacific Ocean. He still had not found his way.In the end, Lee doesn't appear to be trying to teach his audience. He is not moralizing; he is presenting choices and explaining how, in this situation, a single man found his way through life, not simply to survive but to live. This is not a movie about a boy and his pet tiger roaming the seven seas; it's about learning about one's inner self and finding an exciting direction in which to take it. And even apart from the symbolic journey that Pi involuntarily undertakes, there is a second moral quandary posed at the very end that will get the viewer thinking. And that, to me, is the real selling point of this movie. The beauty, the majesty, the excitement of the cross-sea trip is almost surreal - but sufficiently realistic to allow one to enjoy its wonder. Yet that final question, posed by the adult Pi, seals the deal. This is a movie best seen on a large screen, the better to appreciate its epic scope.","

"virindra","18 December 2012","I went to Life of Pi special event in our local cinema and the movie was sold out on two screens. I have never seen this before. The movie is about religion and a cast away. The movie is very funny, frightening, serious, dramatic, beautiful, breathtaking, intelligent at the same time. The story behind the story is fantastic. Acting is wonderful. I am glad Irrfhan Khan has put a step out of Bollywood. I loved his movies even when he was not yet a Bollywood star. He had a small part in this movie, but fulfilled that very well.Suraj Sharma is a newcomer and an underdog when it come to acting. He did very well for a first time. This cannot be said about most beginning actors or actresses. I hope he will make more movies (as an actor or director) who have a deeper meaning like Life of Pi. I don't hope for this boy to follow the footsteps of Dev Patel who acted in this wonderful Slumdog Millionair and then in this boring Aribender.Like the beauty of Shravanthi Sainath was breathtaking, so were the scenes of the animals in this movie. I can say it was fantastic. I can imagine that this movie will not make it in India, because it has a heavy take out when it comes to religion. Even in the West the gravity of the real story might for most people be to hard to follow and understand. But for those who can keep their mind to a movie, it is worth watching in the cinema and more times after when it gets out on DVD.","

"rannynm","8 January 2013","This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker. Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual. I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer). A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but thru it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination. Believe the unbelievable and see the amazing adventure in Life of Pi, it triumphs into theaters on November 21. by Brianna Hope Beaton, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","

"estebangonzalez10","26 December 2012","¨All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.¨This film reminded me of why I love movies so much. Even though it is very hard to come across these gems nowadays, once you finally discover one you completely fall in love with it and are reminded why you fell in love with movies in the first place: it is just such a magical and emotional experience. Life of Pi is among the 3 best films of 2012 and despite my dislike towards 3D movies in general, I loved its use here. The art direction, visual effects, and cinematography were astonishing; it was one of the most beautiful films I've seen. This is a film you will want to see in 3D and enjoy the experience as much as possible because in my opinion this is the best use in 3D that I've seen. Life of Pi is based on the successful novel written by Yann Martel which many considered impossible to adapt to the big screen, but Ang Lee found a way to do it yet again. Lee amazed me in 2000 with his wonderful Chinese film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He has always been a magician artistically speaking. He also did a wonderful job with the storytelling and cinematography in Brokeback Mountain, but in Life of Pi he directs his best and most complete film to date. I left the theater totally satisfied and amazed with the wonderful visual experience. I also enjoyed the performances and the storytelling; so I have nothing really negative to critique about Lee's work here. I also love climatic twist endings and this film has one of the best I've seen since The Sixth Sense. This is a masterpiece and a must see movie for all.A writer (Rafe Spall) has been sent by an acquaintance to visit a man named Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) who has a story to tell him that will make him believe in God. Pi receives the writer kindly and while he cooks for the man he begins to narrate his story. The writer is curious to find out what Pi has to tell him and he patiently listens to him as he narrates his story from the very beginning. He explains how he got his name, what his family was doing in India at the time, and so on. Of course none of this is really what the writer is expecting to hear until Pi gets to the heart of the story. He explains that his family owned a zoo and that his father suddenly decided to move them all to Canada. While they are all (including the animals) on their way to Canada on a carrier ship a heavy storm intercepts them and the ship sinks. Pi (the younger version played by Suraj Sharma) manages to survive along with a couple animals: an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Pi struggles to survive along with the animals in the small lifeboat in middle of the Pacific Ocean as he encounters many obstacles that will test his faith. The film is told in a similar fashion to Slumdog Millionaire (through flashbacks which happen to be longer than the present scenes) as we have the narrator telling his incredible story to the writer.Suraj Sharma is really great here as the main character. Incredibly he has had no prior experience as a film actor, but he singlehandedly delivers this movie considering he is in the boat almost the entire time on his own (the animals were added mostly through CGI). A lot of credit has to be given to the visual effects department considering the animals look so real and believable. This film is really beautiful to watch, everything about it is just wonderful, including the powerful climatic ending which had a great message. I thought the film worked as sort of a parable more than an actual metaphor. I haven't read the novel, but I really can't see how it can be better than the film. Lee's imagination works better than mine, and he has created a wonderful film with many memorable scenes that will stick with me forever. The film touches lightly on themes of religion and faith, but at the end it will make you think about it. Everyone can make their own conclusions as to what story they want to believe, but it was pretty clear for me as to where the director was trying to get as to how he viewed God. The less you know about the film before going into it, the better. The film does start a bit slow, but it was a nice setup in my opinion with some beautiful cinematography, and it just picks up from there. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"gradyharp","13 March 2013","As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story. Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: 'In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar, Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments Gérard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better. Grady Harp","

"masonsaul","28 April 2023","Life of Pi is incredible, a technical marvel that has the nuanced and thought provoking story to match it's technical wonders resulting in an extremely rewarding and really spiritual film. It's a beautiful story about self reflection and coming to terms with your own rage shown through an epic adventure at sea.Irrfan Khan makes sure the film starts and ends strong, an elegant storyteller guiding you through this journey with a heartfelt honesty. Suraj Sharma is equally good as the younger Pi, bringing that youthful energy and humour that matures as the film goes along.Ang Lee's direction is amazing, the film is one of the most beautiful films ever made with go for broke imagery and a colour palette so vivid it was destined to be on blu ray & TV adverts forever. Even when watching it in 2-D it's still very easy to see the clear technical craft on display in the 3-D photography.The CG is really impressive, there's a few weak spots undoubtedly hurt further by the higher frame rate but overall it doesn't detract that much. The music by Mychael Danna definitely matches the imagery in awe inspiring beauty as well as having the required soulfulness.","

"heisenberg12","14 February 2021","I was loving this movie up until the very end when Pi has to change his story, and then the movie tries to use that as its message. It had better messaging in it in the first 45 minutes regarding religion, God, and spirituality than it did by changing the narrative. The metaphors were ambiguous and sufficient without doing a twist like that.Outside of that, it was a really immersive and fun movie to watch so it's conflicting enough that I want to rate it higher but also feel like it may deserve lower because of the ending. Still, compared to what other kinds of movies you can rent to distract and entertain you for two hours these days, I thought it was a great find and experience for that with high quality storytelling up until the ending. It could have been a 10/10 with a better ending.7.5/10","

"TomTomH","13 January 2013","Ang Lee's 3D VFX film adaptation of Yann Martel's 2001 award-winning book of the same name, ""Life of Pi"", is such an amazing film with stunning artwork. Sitting in the cinema last night with friends, it was quite a jaw-dropping experience. I've got to say this would be impossible to do with real animals. Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, if he was real, not CGI, would have not been easy on set. The way they animate the tiger and background is incredible. Whenever I saw a clean shot of the boat (that Pi and Parker sail in) and the sinking ship, it reminds me of the look of the animation they do in Spielberg's Tintin.Pi's life is told in three stages: childhood, teenage life and adult. The adult stage is quite emotional. The story is delivered by adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) retelling the story about his unbelievable past life to a writer (Rafe Spall, Prometheus). Pi's childhood (portrayed by Gautam Belur, age 5 and Ayush Tandun, age 13) starts with him being bullied at school because of his unusual name, which then he shortens, but still causes teasing. He soon begins to become interested with different religions which causes some amusement. His father owns a zoo and he teaches Pi how to take care of the animals. These lessons Pi's been taught helps him later on in his life. The teenage Pi's life (portrayed by Suraj Sharma) begins his perilous journey when sailing on a ship moving to Canada, when his family agree to move from India. On the way, Pi and the ship encounter a heavy storm which ends up sinking the ship and him ending up on a lifeboat, becoming the only (human) survivor. While lost at sea with no hope, he discovers that a tiger (Richard Parker) has come aboard. Although he knows the tiger wants to kill him, he eventually works out a way to control him. Thinking about Parker, he reminds me a little bit of Aslan from C.S. Lewis' Narnia series; when he walks and roars and uses tiger facial expressions, but not when he attacks. He's a lot fiercer than Aslan, who is more calm and friendly.For Suraj Sharma (teenage Pi), this is his first ever acting debut in film and already he's received his very first Bafta nomination for the Orange Rising Star Award category (and that's what I think he deserves). He brings a touching and rewarding performance as Pi, I think he's the perfect choice for the role. It's special effects and 3D are fantastic. Whenever you see the animals and human extras, you even wonder if their completely CGI. Of course whenever I saw Richard Parker I knew it was going to be computer-generated, but I've just learnt that four real tigers were used in some shots. and you still can't tell which is which. It would have been completely impossible to film right out at sea, so thanks to computer-generated imagery, it couldn't be easier. The 3D effects are incredible (like Martin Scorsese's Hugo but in a different way). This isn't a gimmick. No. These are unlike the other 3D films we see today in which 3D is sometimes unnecessary. Lee (I think) uses 3D almost like they use it on 3D wildlife channels on 3D TV. In this film the animals look as real as on a wildlife programme. You wonder how they manage it, and that's what gives the film an amazing look. At one point it feels like the sea will spill into the cinema. You'd be amazed. Life of Pi is a film that should be seen in 3D to experience the special effects. It isn't the best film I've ever seen but I still think it's spectacular. A must-see!","

"fredrikgunerius","18 October 2023","Life of Pi tells the remarkable story of a young Indian boy (Suraj Sharma) whose family decide to relocate to Canada along with their zoo of animals. Then a massive storm sets in, the ship goes down, and Pi finds himself the only human survivor in a lifeboat along with a wounded zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger, and they must all fight for survival in an unforgiving Pacific ocean whilst learning to relate to each other.Hailed for its breathtaking 3D visuals and fantastic story, Life of Pi is an obvious crowd-pleaser celebrating life, nature, and a romanticized version of the survival of the fittest. At its best, the movie encapsulates much of what the film medium has to offer, but I don't care too much for Ang Lee's direction here. It's too showy, too overspirited, like something made high on drugs. Nature's wonders and carefully selected 3D-friendly images are being thrown at you whenever Lee feels the need to embellish. Additionally, the conversational narrative form makes the first part of the film too talky and explanatory. In a film as devoted to imagery as this, I would have wished the filmmakers had used the rich visuals more to tell the story than to brag.The highlights are few and far between, but in the film's middle part - the survival segments - Lee finally lets his images speak for themselves, and this is easily the pinnacle of the film. The interplay between the boy and the tiger is among the most believable and interesting aspects in an otherwise at times unbelievable setting, and it combines tension and suspense with several fascinating psychological and behaviouristic observations.The richness of this story is unquestionable, and I suspect the novel could be a good read, but the film only works partially because it's too unfocused and shallow. Some will claim that fantastical elements needn't be believable or accounted for, but in Life of Pi these elements work merely as an excuse for scoring cheap points and preach pretentiously about the importance of having faith, believing in yourself, follow your dreams, and several other vapid Hollywoodish clichés. Life of Pi will probably be a wet dream for uncritical AMPAS members, but it's really one of the most flawed movies of the year - albeit never completely uninteresting.","

"Anurag-Shetty","3 December 2012","Life of Pi is about the incredible journey of Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) after he's stranded on a boat with a couple of zoo animals, such as a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena & the most important animal is an adult Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. The story of Pi's life is narrated by an adult Pi(Irrfan Khan). Pi's story begins in Pondicherry where he lived with his mother(Tabu), his father(Adil Hussain) who is a zoo owner & his brother, Ravi(Mohd. Abbas Khaleeli). From here on the story just flows at an incredible pace where you neither get confused nor do you get bored even for a single minute. LOP is a treat to watch even before Pi gets stranded on a boat with all the animals.First off, this is the most visually appealing film of all time! The 3D in this movie is more or less the best 3D I've ever seen. It's even better than Avatar because most of the environment in this movie, is real! Ang Lee has portrayed India beautifully. This movie deserves all the Oscars that it's most probably going to get. A note on the performances. Newcomer Suraj Sharma is brilliant as Pi. The viewer doesn't even realize that he's a newcomer. Irrfan Khan is, as usual, mind blowing as the adult Pi. Tabu is great as Pi's mother. Abbas Khaleeli is impressive as Ravi. The other kid actors who played Pi & Ravi at different stages in their life are spectacular as well. Therefore, Life of Pi is a must watch. I promise you that, it's an experience of a lifetime!","

"ironhorse_iv","27 July 2013","Written by Yann Martel, Life of Pi was one of those novels that most filmmakers thought was un-filmable. The reasons why are because 'Life of Pi' deals with the main character grew up trying to find the ultimate truth of life by questioning different religions and aspires to find that ultimate truth one day. Life of Pi is about seeing the world through Pi's eyes. This is precisely why it's strongly called an un-filmable book because it's almost impossible to visualize on screen the combined feeling of every sight of the amazing spectacles that the ocean can show an young adult like Pi and how they take him closer to the answers for his questions. But, Directed Ang Lee succeeded in making this movie amazing. This movie visuals are amazing. Epic cinematography by Claudio Miranda. Ang Lee was able to make the near lifeless seem boring Pacific Ocean into a wondering trip into self-discovery and survivable. The 3D actually work, and wasn't cheesy at all. I love the soundtrack by Mychael Danna, it was beautiful to listen with the film. Life of Pi just had such a rich story. On the outside, it's basic. A castaway, kind of film. But Ang brings brilliant timing to the film which makes it emotional and strong. It's confusing at times and sometimes feels slow, but you forget about that because the movie is something that has good meaning, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Life of Pi is very faithful to the book, I'd suggest reading first, but anyways most of the film is about a young man name Piscine 'Pi' Patel who father own a zoo. Suraj Sharma plays Pi in his film debut and what a debut, he was great in the film. The scene where he kill the fish was emotional. Anyways, Pi and his family decide to travel to Canada for a better life, and hopefully make money selling the zoo animals. Too bad, nobody makes it beside Pi who survives a disaster at sea when his ship sank leaving him in a lifeboat with four animals on board. There is a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger name Richard Parker. Unlike, other human & animal relationship movies, that has the character befriend a wild animal to the point, it seem like it's a pet. This movie doesn't do that; at all. Most of the movie has Richard Parker wanting to eat the Indian boy. It wasn't until Pi establish himself as the alpha male that Richard Parker became less of a danger to him. I have to say the CGI tiger was the most realistic computer animal, I have ever saw. Good job! Still, Pi and Richard Parker must now learn to survive this harsh new world. For a PG film, it pretty dark with themes of cannibalism. Research Richard Parker and shipwrecks online. Some critics says it has warning about the dangers of increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and ocean acidification, but I really don't see that in this film. I do like the Gaia hypothesis that some critics point out. I can see it. Without spoiling too much of the film, I have to say that the movie is really good. Still, it took a while for the film to get to the sinking scene with all the attempts at spirituality. While, I did love the scenes explaining who Pi is like the whole French swimming pool story, and Pi looking for religion and love. I just wish it didn't take so long to explain because I think the best part of the movie are the relationship with him and the tiger. I do love the idea that most of the narration coming from middle age Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) telling his story to the novelist Yann Martel (Rafe Spall). Irrfan Khan gives one of his best acting here. I love the scene, where he explains what happen to Richard Parker. I was deeply surprised he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for this role. I do hate the fact that Yann Martel plagiarism the idea from Brazilian writer and physician Moacyr Scliar 1981's novel 'Max and the Cats'. Still, I think Life of Pi is a little bit better than 'Max and the Cats'. I have readt both in doing my research for the film. I just glad the director cut the state of delirium scene from the book. The twist in the end was so moving and truthful. It marked how humans are in fact like animals and also gave an alternative to the basic perception of life; do you chose to view life through science and reason, or religion. The movie is deeply religionists, but it didn't bug me like other critics. I love the symbolism of the island of algae. It represents the atheist mindset that we eat till death and we get consumed by the world itself in the end and nothing matters, a bleek future. I myself, as an agnostic, I understand the brute cruelty meaningless of this world. Raw matter organized itself with an organic backbone and over the course of billions of years of improvement, it emerged to artificially build a society upon all that nothingness. I agree, it's best to remain agnostic because you have no concrete answers about the universe. Atheism is a form of concluding one's mind, not a fan. Overall: The thing I like about this movie is that whichever story you believe, your right and both a physically possible whether you believe the literal or metaphorical meaning it is both equally plausible.","

"jdkraus","19 December 2012","""Life of Pi"" is unlike any other film about survival that I have ever seen. The film starts with Pi Patel, an adult who is being interviewed by a Canadian writer who wants to write a great book. Told in flashback, Pi reveals his story, starting with his family, his pursuit of studying different religions, and the animals that his father cared for, including a 450-pound Bengal tiger. His family decides to move to Canada to begin a new life. They hitch a ride on a boat that gets caught in a storm. Surviving the sinking, Pi is forced adrift on a 26-foot lifeboat—with an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and the Bengal tiger. While the story seems simple enough, there are many deep, religious and philosophical undertones thrown into the mix that puts the viewer in a position to think and wonder. Part of the beauty of this film, is that it can be interpreted in many ways. What I see as the underlying message or theme maybe different than someone else. It is not only a movie worth seeing, but it is also worth discussing. With a great degree of ambiguousness and thought-provoking undercurrents, ""Life of Pi"" is supported by magical feats of movie-making. It is a stunning film to look at with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects that are near perfection, and an emotionally driven musical score. The cast is mostly made up of unknowns to the American audience, but they work well in their given roles, specifically Suraj Sharma as young Pi—he gives us a character to care for. However, the character I cared for the most though is the Bengal Tiger. It may seem bad to favor a CGI animal over a human actor, but the SFX geniuses of Rhythm & Hues have given us a being to admire and awe. This movie has been a privilege to see in cinema. I am afraid though that it will lose its impact once it is converted to DVD and Blu-Ray, for to truly appreciate its power, ""Life of Pi"" is a movie that must be seen on the big screen.","

"TheMovieSnob247","16 February 2013","I've been waiting for a film to really capture my imagination from 2012 and I was beginning to think it wasn't going to happen. Life of Pi finally did that. Stunningly beautiful and inspiring, it's the best movie I've seen from last year. A young man (Pi) and his family are shipwrecked while moving to America with the animals from their family zoo. While he manages to survives the ordeal on a life boat, he must find a way to co-exist with some of the other survivors of the wreck; particularly a Bengal Tiger curiously named Richard Parker. A few minutes into this I knew I was going to love this movie. The opening scenes were beautiful shot and the musical score was joyous and whimsical. I was intrigued from the start and the film kept me that way throughout. There's something about well made movies with animals just I can't resist (yes, I'm a sucker that way). I don't think I've ever watched Two Brothers without being moved to tears. First off all, Ang Lee does a lot with very little on screen out side of the ocean and a boat. You would think there isn't much you can do with a film story like this, but Lee makes it work (his creativity is clearly on display). There are some really beautiful visual effects scenes (especially at night time) and the CG Tiger was beyond belief! I still can't believe that Tiger wasn't real, just outstanding work by the visual effects team that worked on that. I also felt the 3D worked really well for this movie. 3D works when it's used to make the film more immersive (like in Avatar) and not just as a cheap gimmick in order to charge more. The pacing was very good at no point in the over 2 hours did I feel it dragged or lost interest. There was also more than enough to keep you entertained (again, it's hard to do this when limited with what you can do) and plenty of humour was sprinkled throughout. Combining this with the soothing score and great storytelling, this film just seemed to work for me on every level. There are some definite parallels to Cast Away; this seemed unavoidable given the nature of the story. While there were similarities, at no point did I find this film was a cheap imitation or ripped off Cast Away as some would suggest. This film stands on it's own merit and I even felt had a number of powerful scenes that rivalled Robert Zemeckis's classic. It takes great acting to make both these movies work and fortunately that is the case here. Newcomer Suraj Sharma (young Pi) creates a character you can't help but love. And Irfan Khan's (adult Pi) narration is outstanding and pulls everything together. Together they really bring this character to life and are very believable; when the emotional scenes come, they hit home. The ultimate scene of this film for me comes when Richard Parker and Young Pi's journey comes to an end and it's so heartbreaking it had me fighting back tears. Both Suraj and Irfan are completely broken and their performances lift the scene to what I think maybe the most emphatic of 2012. It reminded me of a similar scene in Cast Away that is one of my favorite movie moments ever and gets me every time. There are philosophical and spiritual elements of this film which I found really interesting as well. I tend to hate most movies where you watch most of the film and at the end the film does a complete 180 and says ""Oh, what you watched the last 1.5 hours didn't really happen; *this* is what really happened!"". That gimmick is often used to create shock value and most of the time is a cop out by the director for a bad story. The difference here is that mechanism serves a legitimate purpose in this film. In another moving scene in the film Young Pi tells another version of the story. The author (and Ang Lee via proxy) doesn't treat you as a child and dictate to you what to believe and why. Two stories are presented and it's up to you to believe in whichever you choose. The film makes it clear it's not so much which story you chose to believe, but why you chose it and whether or not you're at peace with that decision. And in making your choice, I think the film forces you learn something about yourself. I confirmed what I've always believed: that I'm hopelessly optimistic. I loved that this film challenged me in this way and it sparked a really interesting conversation on the drive home and among friends later. This for me is always one of the elements of a great movie; the lasting effect of it. What was the film saying? What does the film mean to you personally? How does it make you look at life or circumstances differently? These are all questions I was asking myself in the days after and even now still. And everyone has their own answers and opinions, as they should. And that's kind of the point. While I'm pulling for it to win Best Picture next week, Hollywood politics are always in play. It looks like that's going to either Zero Dark Thirty or Lincoln. Which is really unfortunate, because this is a better overall film than both of those films. I wish this had maybe come out in a weaker year where it would receive the praise it deserves. If this were to match up against say Slumdogg Millionaire or The King's Speech, it would be a no brainer in my opinion.This film blew me away and it's not to be missed. Movies like Life of Pi are why I love going to movies.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob","

"sashank_kini-1","27 November 2012","My first recommendation to any adult would be to watch this film alone- not with their noisy friends, or meddlesome children. The reason for this is simple - in order to totally submit oneself to the visual and spiritual experience delivered by the movie, one has to remain alone, just as Pi does for over two hundred days, being the only human stranded on the lifeboat. I believe this experience cannot be savored when one's emotional response is dictated by the collective feeling of the group (just imagine sitting there holding back your tears because you do not want your friends to snicker at you. In spite of going alone, I was disturbed a couple of times by some people who were wowed by the lion ( it's a tiger, for god's sake!), so I'm glad I didn't bring anyone with me who would have surely robbed me of the delight and wonderment that Life of Pi delivers. The story of Pi's journey of a lifetime begins with a enchantingly dreamy opening sequence showing animals, birds and reptiles of many kinds at a zoo. What's so astonishing about this sequence is that you are so lost admiring the beauty of the animals shown without narration but with a soulful Indian classical music score that you pay no attention to the opening credits until the name of Ang Lee pops up more prominently at the end. The first Pi that we see is probably in his forties and has already completed his journey long back. On his uncle's insistence, he shares his life story with a writer. As the older Pi narrates his story, the camera inter-cuts between the present time and Pi's childhood through fluid dissolves and morphs. We get to know why Pi is called Pi - a queer name for an Indian kid; we can make out that Pi is one curious boy who believes in exploring religion and spirituality and has a deep affinity to animals. A pivotal incident in his early days involving Richard Parker changes his attitude towards life and other matters that were consequential to him before. His family decides to move to Canada on a Japanese ship along with the zoo animals; an unexpected storm hits them on their journey and only Pi manages to hold on to the life boat... along with an injured zebra, a friendly orangutan, a cantankerous hyena and the mighty Richard Parker. What follows then is a deeply mesmerizing tale of courage, will to survive, perseverance, realization and ultimately - hope, which is what the world needs right now, hope.Life of Pi is full of deep and important themes, and I can say, based on the experience I had in the theater, that more than three fourth of the audience were either i) oblivious to the metaphorical allusions or ii) not interested enough to get them. If you give adequate attention to the movie, you shall realize how important the element of water is the film; the swimming pool scene with Pi's uncle, Piscine being named after the pool and the entire journey taking place in the ocean - all three incidents have the element of water in common. Why does Pi look closely at the ocean water and see his life flash before him? Is it a commentary of how fate works? What about the journey of Richard Parker and Pi? Is it only to show the relation between man and animal? Pi fears Parker and distances himself from his fear, only to confront and later conquer his fear (i.e. Parker) but not by destroying Parker but by developing an understanding with him (his fear). What does Pi gain from this journey? Hope is the word I get whenever I search for answers, and isn't hope required in this world, especially when you lose everything? And hasn't this message been reiterated so many times after 7/11 and the financial crisis in USA? Obama's inaugural address when he was elected for the first time stressed on hope, films such as 127 hours channelize hope. It isn't a surprise that Life of Pi has come this year and is doing well at the box office - people want films that carry the message of hope. And, I think Life of Pi teaches that you can get hope provided you have the will to survive and resist the temptation of an enclosed existence. There are some standout scenes in Life of Pi which includes the opening scene, the storm scene, the moment Pi looks into the water wondering what Richard is looking intently at and the second storm scene. The third scene from above is especially noteworthy because of the way Ang Lee has filmed it - after the camera takes us underwater to get a view of Pi's vision, it goes back to show Pi's reaction for a second, and then, for about two seconds,cuts to the face of Richard Parker looking at him.This was one unforgettable moment that shook me completely. I've mentioned the second storm scene as a notable one as it gives us some minutes to reflect on whatever has happened in the film, and this is the point people should think instead of answering their cell phone calls ( person next to me).Irfan Khan so honestly conveyed his sadness towards the end with not more than a teardrop. I really wished Suraj Sharma could do that instead of feigning grief by simply quivering his lips mechanically, speaking without conveying a sense of terrible isolation and not understanding fully the relevance of his character in the film. In many scenes, his eyes do not give us anything and he says important lines without hinting the subtext beneath them. It's still a good job considering he has no prior acting experience.","

"CrazyArty","20 March 2022","After a shipwreck, an Indian boy is left stranded on a lifeboat with an adult tiger.A beautifully shot film with an interesting story (adapted from a bestselling novel). The film has some touching moments and some tense moments too.It's a well made adaptation and probably deserves an 8* rating but I prefer plot to style and the ending few scenes let the film down for me.","

"Ash_Heydrich","19 December 2012","I am an Indian. I watched this in India. With my girlfriend next to me. And we laughed hard throughout the movie because of the horrible Indian accent of all ages of Pi. Thanks to Russell Peters who has actually ruined the Indian accent forever, because lets face it, it is really like that. You can never take a guy who speaks in such accent seriously. ""Richard Parker, I have got water for you, Richard Parker"" I mean mother of god!! Speaking of God, and religion, it's not down everybody else's lane, like I am an Atheist and proudly so, so I found this movie a propaganda for religious fanatics. This Pi guy really should have used pronouns for Richard Parker. Honestly. 227 days out on the sea and still a better love story than twilight, though. Cinematography was awesome of course, watching it in 3D was superb, but its just that. Everything else was a joke. Ang Lee, I'll have what you're smoking.","

"superduperspit","28 January 2013","2012 is a great film year. Almost all the films I looked forward to delivered. However one stood above them all and that's Life of Pi. I believe this is not only the best film of 2012 but one of the best films I've seen in my life.What makes Pi great is the different way it works. On the surface, if just taking the story for what it is, it's a great film in many ways. It has a likable lead and story and manages to make a boy floating on a raft entertaining. I can't say enough about how well crafted the confrontations between Pi and Parker are. Ang Lee uses the boat as a perfect device for their head to head ""battles"".But of course, Life of Pi is more than just a great story. It is steeped with symbolism. The genius ending by Yann Martel of course gives the entire film a new face. Which Pi story was real? Of course the answer is that neither are meant to be truly real. What's important is what someone takes out of a story and what it means to them. As a film viewer this is applicable to us, listening to Pi's story or another movie's, we can interpret it whichever way we want - by whichever fits our personal code. In the early stages of the film much is made of Pi's personal beliefs (in many different religions) compared to the characters around him. His father believes in science, his mother more the heart. A man even believes in swimming pools as his salvation. This is all important because just as Pi is willing to believe in multiple religions and pick the important parts from each, one interprets Pi's story in their own way and in turn, their own life in their own way But more than just that, to me all of Life of Pi is symbolic of life. We are all boys on a raft in the ocean, braving the coming and going storms and searching for our destination. It bears mentioning that brilliantly, Pi is not going home. He's going to a foreign, new place. Just as in the journey to life, we do not go to the past, we go to an uncertain future.Regardless of whether Pi's story was real or not, what seems obvious is that Richard Parker is meant to represent Pi's internal psychi. Hearkening back to the argument about science vs the heart, Pi is the rational member on the boat and Parker is the ferocious, emotional one. One can read Pi's journey as his rationality fighting with his emotional self. Likewise one could argue the other animals on the boat if not real, represent parts of himself. The zebra perhaps is the side of him that wanted to feel like a victim after the crash, the hyena the side that wanted to flip out and get angry and the orangutan the one that thought his parents had a chance to be alive. Quickly his victim side and his family-loving side is engulfed by anger, which then recedes.One tell that the entire journey is a symbolism of life is the carnivorous island. This is an island that most people visit. The carnivorous island is when we get to a place that's so comfortable and secure, that we threaten to let ourselves get stuck there, instead of moving onto new and unknown adventures in our life. Pi has to choose whether to stay in this place and be eaten by this security of life, or to move on and he chooses to move one.The part that fascinates me the most about this story is the decision to make Parker leave, without turning back to Pi. If one accepts Parker is a representation of Pi's emotional internal self, what does his snub mean? Did Pi lose his heart and emotional self in that journey across the ocean? Did leaving the the security of the island (where he'd have been with Parker forever) require sacrificing that part of himself? Or is it that in the real world, the emotional self cannot roam free with the rational, controlled self. Just as Parker had to be caged up before they got on the ship. It took that journey on the ocean for Pi to come in touch with his animalistic self, but they could never be together in civilization and this is what breaks Pi's heart as he's telling the story.Ang Lee is simply masterful. Aside from the crafting of scenes on the ship as I mentioned, the editing is perfect. Think about the scenes like Parker eating the goat in the cage, or the animals on the boat. Every scene transition is simply perfect. Every cut to Pi telling the story is crafted perfectly. This is a film where a master is truly in control of his medium. Of course I didn't even mention the all time great visual effects Life of Pi is not only perfectly crafted and written, but it is layered with fascinating depth and psychology as a movie about life itself, choices and the meaning we take out of our lives. This is a true film masterpiece and work of art.","

Anyone notice?No review needed, this was an amazing movie and the only one I've rated 10 stars.But it looked to me like Pi caused the shipwreck. Most ships like that can weather a storm without sinking IF THE DOORS ARE CLOSED. But Pi left the outside door open in rough seas, which is how water gets inside the boat, which is how it sinks. Did I miss something or was that a production mistake? Why did he leave the door open?","

"Manal1987","22 January 2013","""Krishna opens his mouth, and Yashoda gasps she sees in Krishna's mouth the whole complete entire timeless universe!""The following is a story Pi's mother recounts to him as a kid. The young god Krishna was wrongly accused of eating a bit of dirt. When his foster mother, Yashoda, knows about it, she scolds him and orders him to open his mouth, inside which she sees the whole universe; lands and skies, planets and galaxies, past and future, hopes and fears everything.This religious Hindu story should be kept at the back of your mind throughout the entire film for it sets ups the stage for Pi's life. The movie starts with the adult Pi Patel who narrates to a novelist his own survival adventure; how he survived a violent shipwreck in which he lost his entire family and his father's zoo animals, and how he managed to coexist with a Bengal tiger for weeks on a stranded lifeboat. The story of Pi, originally written by Yann Martel and adapted to screen by David Magee, succeeds in stripping the confusing issue of faith down to its core. Pi, the result of a world which is part secular (the father) and part shyly religious (the mother), represents the modern man with all his anxiety, confusion and questions. The young Pi could feel a greater power controlling the universe even though he could not place or define this power. That is why he became a Hindu, a Christian, and a Muslim, all at the same time.The movie is dense with symbolic cues that will need to be revisited and reconsidered every time you ponder on Pi's adventure. First of all, we are told that the Bengal tiger is called Richard Parker because its original name, Thirsty, was swapped with the name of its hunter in the registers. When young Pi gets attached to Richard, his atheist father feels obliged to prove to him that Richard is merely a beast and that it is not soul that he sees in the tiger's eyes but only a reflection of his own emotions. Whether the tiger had a soul or was only a reflected image of Pi is left to the viewer to decide. Moreover, Pi's adventure in the sea can be interpreted as man's journey through life, full of hopes, hardships, miracles and letdowns. Everything Pi encounters helps in his emotional, spiritual, and intellectual growth. However, what makes Pi different is that he manages to live life and see (and make us see as well!) the universe as reflected inside him.The ending of the film is absolutely brilliant. It gives place for both doubt and belief equally because, as Pi puts it, ""doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested."" After the shipwreck, the hypo-narrative (Pi's adventure) gets divided into two parallel, if not opposite, stories; one is miraculous and incredible, and the other is gruesome yet realistic. The adult Pi gives us the freedom to choose between the two because, according to him, both stories entail the same amount of suffering and sacrifice and have the same result and choosing to believe in one of them depends on the person's internal universe. Simply put, in any given moment of your life, you have all the reasons to be happy and you have all the reasons to be sad.. it is you who chooses, and it is you who writes the story. And this is how faith works. This is how God works.Life of Pi is certainly Ang Lee's masterpiece so far; thoughtful direction, celestial cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and mature and vivid performance by both Suraj Sharma, who masterfully captured Pi's earlier years of confusion and restlessness, and Irrfan Khan who played the adult Pi with sincere, hard-earned maturity and confidence. The film is relatively long, but there is not a single moment you will feel the slightest tinge of boredom throughout this completely immersive experience.Life of Pi is a feast for both the mind and the eye. A definitely must- see.","

The twist is that there is a tiger on his lifeboat.The film tells a tale of survival, of how Pi has to battle the treacherous ocean and at the same time fear for the ferocious tiger. His constant battles to survive is engagingly presented, as each challenge is so real. It's amazing how desperate situations can bring another side out of us. As the plot continues, something feels not so right, until the twist comes that everything makes sense again. This twist serves not only to surprise and entertain, but adds a whole new dimension to ponder upon. The struggles presented initially all pales in comparison. It's intensely moving.

"rgkarim","22 November 2012","Next up on my Thanksgiving weekend reviews is the newest novel based movie called Life of Pi. This past summer I was captivated by the wonderful trailer that was visually stunning and had a killer soundtrack that matched the flow of the trailer. When I found out Ang Lee was directing it I got even more excited that this film was going to be an artistic wonder. Since I hadn't read the book though, I had no idea what else I was in store for other than a modern version of the Cast Away movie. So what did this movie have to offer? Read on to find out.For those who haven't seen the trailer or read the book, Life of Pi is the tale of a man named Piscine Patel, known by most as Pi, an Indian boy who likes to question many rules and discover new lessons. On the voyage to a new home in Canada, the boat Pi and his family are riding capsizes leaving him stranded with a few animals and some rations on a small lifeboat. The teenage boy will discover a world he never imagined, while struggling to maintain his life in the lonely world of the ocean.That's pretty much the plot, so you might wonder what makes this movie different from Cast Away, other than the main character is Indian and there is a tiger. I'll start with talking about the visuals of this move, which for me and a couple of my buddies was the best element of the movie. From the get go, the cinematography is amazing capturing the natural beauty of the Indian continent. As the opening credits start, the audience is treated to some well angled shots of the various zoo creatures, each doing their own thing as if nothing is happening. Once the movie officially starts though, the camera work continues to get better, with every angle being selected to get the most out of the scene. Even the chaotic scenes aboard the sinking ship were well captured, skipping the chaotic camera angles for the use of CGI and visuals to create the feelings of uncontrolled fear. When calm eventually returns the desolate world of the vast ocean is impressively recreated on the screen. Many of its inhabitants are well polished and designed to have you thinking they are real, that is until you get a closer look. Upon focusing on the actual creatures, you can see where the realism starts to blur a bit, as the animals become a little too polished and clean. Despite this though, the animation for the animals is still impressive, capturing their movements to the finite detail and adapting them to the interaction with Pi and the tiger. Thus the artistic aspects of this movie are definitely prevailing in this movie. A second big quality of this movie is the spirituality built into this feature film. Before even pushing out on the boat, Pi begins experimenting with multiple religions, each being explained in their connection to the deities. Those interested in religion will get a nice refresher course in theology; though will appreciate more of the practice in this movie. Scenes where Pi prays or talks to God are sure to strike up some feelings in fans, whether good or bad really depends on the person. For this reviewer, it did make me thankful for many things, and helping strengthen my spiritual connection. There are even a few other scenes that seem like a trippy experience into the spiritual realm that is visually beautiful, but still a little weird. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. What else is there to mention about this movie? Well I can warn you now that there are some graphic scenes of life that may disturb some people. I admit that some of the animal hostility in this film made me very sad, and could make little kids cry their eyes out. Despite this sadness though, I have to admit it is very realistic as when fighting for survival animals can turn into savage monsters. Those looking for a story with lots of twists and turns are also advised to skip this movie as well, since it is little more than an Indian boy fighting for survival and documenting his adventure. However, those who like movies that dive into the mind and character are going to be up for this film. Another thing about this film is the pace of the movie keeps things a little slow. Again this is a life adventure, but did we really need over two hours of film to see this? For this reviewer not really, as half an hour less could have helped with the long dragging feeling of this film. The acting by Suraj Sharma was very passionate at many points in the movie and well representative of the emotions. Unfortunately some of the scenes forced him to be a little too passionate in his yelling, leading to a little over-dramatic tension.To wrap this review up, Ang Lee and company have created a visually stunning masterpiece that makes you think about your spiritual beliefs. With award winning animation, polished creature design, beautiful settings and cinematography, and some well done editing, it's no doubt this movie will be a candidate for best visual effects. What could have made it even better though was adding a soundtrack like the trailer to further bring out the magic, instead of just using it for the sad scenes. Regardless this movie is best seen in the theater with the visuals, yet if you go for plot wait until it releases on Netflix. My scores for this movie are the following: Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 please email rkarim11@su.edu for constructive criticism","

"LloydBayer","20 December 2012","The last time director Ang Lee made a tiger crouch, he walked away with about a dozen Oscar nominations, all from just one film. This time Lee goes all the way by unleashing the dragon – this is not just a beast of a movie, it is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in everything that it sets out to be. Possibly the best adapted screenplay this year, LIFE OF PI remains true to its award winning source material by Yann Martel; at least for the most part. Just like the novel, the story plays out in three parts, starting with the introduction of Pi and how he was named after a swimming pool in France. Narrated by Irfan Khan as the older Pi, the story is set in 1970s Pondicherry, a former French colonial city in India. Born and raised a Hindu, Piscine Molitor Patel, the teenage protagonist and titular character dwells into the beliefs of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, without claiming any one religion as superior. Pi's father, a business minded zoo owner has other priorities like migrating to Canada, along with some of the exotic zoo animals for sale once they reach their destination. In a cruel twist of fate, the journey is short-lived soon after they sail into the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. Although tragic in nature, the sinking of the freighter, along with Pi's parents and elder brother, is emotionally overwhelming yet visually spellbinding as the first of many sequences Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda has in store for the audience. What follows is a fierce and fascinating tale of survival when Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with an injured zebra, a merciless hyena, an orangutan and a fearsome but majestic Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. Right from the opening credits, Lee and Miranda mesmerises us with one of the most incredible set pieces ever built for cinema. Forget what TV spots and teasers are calling this movie. Judging from what critics have to say, LIFE OF Pi is indeed an epic visualisation but not necessarily justifiable in its comparison to AVATAR. Apart from the novel use of 3D in both films, I personally can't think of any other similarity. Lee's use of 3D is not just immersive for the sake of being so; it becomes the skeletal binding to the pulsating flesh and blood of the story in such a way that I actually forgot about the 3D spectacles resting on the bridge of my nose!Thanks to David Magee's adaptation, Lee has made possible what acclaimed filmmakers have previously side-lined as impossible to film. From virtual humming birds hovering at arm's reach, to the scene when we first meet Richard Parker, to embellishing the sheer beauty of creation, Lee has broken new ground in the way cinema interprets literature. No doubt there. However, Lee's nuance as a storyteller is in bringing out the book's underlying significance of subtly suggesting the existence of God, through a relentless test of faith. This is done by two actors: Suraj Sharma as the ship-wrecked younger Pi who exalts God even in the most trying situations. The other actor is of course Irfan Khan, whose retrospect narration to a writer proves the very existence of God. For a débutant, Sharma has a large chunk of screen-time and holds the story singlehandedly with some amusing interjections. On the other hand, khan has fewer scenes but skilfully advocates the phrase that less can prove to be more.From where I'm seated, LIFE OF Pi has a sure fire lock-on for a few Oscar nominations. But the real reason this is a must-see film, preferably in 3D (I can't stress this enough), is because there is every bit of passion in its making from surreal cinematography, a soul stirring original score, to spectacular visual effects, and a phenomenal narration that only ends when you hear an inner voice that says 'Believe'.","

"socrates99","2 December 2012","I bought the book when it was first being touted as a literary gem but then decided not to read it, so I have nothing to gauge how well Ang Lee did in interpreting the book. That said, this is one of the most endearing movies I've ever seen.My first thought having just seen it was, thank God some studio didn't get a hold of it first to do an American take on the book. This movie so deserves and demands its setting and foreign lead actors. I admit I probably would have enjoyed one of our better young leads in the role of Pi, but I'm much better off having grappled with the Indian chosen by Lee who, for some reason, populates this movie with everything from Mexicans, Indians, Japanese and Anglos to tigers, hyenas, orangutans and zebras, but not one Chinese person. I thought that a little odd but perhaps the books that way too.I saw the 2D version mainly because I was expecting some exploration of the god issue, but I was mostly disappointed in that. The talk of religion is very brief and not very interesting. What was interesting is the survival story and the boy's relationships with wild animals.I had no idea whether for the most part I was watching a real tiger or not. Let's just say that if Lee had to wait for the tiger to do everything he does in this movie, he by rights should still be out there filming. Someone with a real love for animals and an eye for their behavior clearly had a hand in making these scenes look real. And then there are the shots at sea. The sea rises in great swells and you would think Pi is actually in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific being carelessly tossed around by a violent storm; it's truly masterful, unprecedented filmmaking.Even my wife who is no friend to animals thought the movie went by quickly and was happy to have seen it.","

This is a very unique movie, unlike any you may have seen before. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is compelling, the cinematography breath taking, and the adventure is spellbinding. If that sounds like a fun time at the movies, then this one is for you.I had the good fortune to see this movie in 3D, I'm sure it is good without the 3D effect, but if you have a choice, try 3D as the special effects are nothing less than mind blowing.I loved this one, time seemed to fly by and I didn't want this adventure to end, I'd say that is the true test of a great film.....enjoy!!","

"jadepietro","28 November 2012","This film is mildly recommended. Give me the real thing anytime! Sparkling rhinestones never trump diamonds. Plastic trees and silk flowers can never substitute for nature's glories. Artificial sweeteners are fine for awhile, but usually leave a funny aftertaste. Which brings us to Ang Lee's Life of Pi, a so-so entertainment that is long on style and short in substantial value.Overdone best describes this film. Visually, the film is a stunning work of art. ( I found the 3-D to be totally enthralling, almost too precise and overworked at times, but still a remarkable undertaking of this process. ) The film's color palette has an exciting vibrancy that is unmatched by other films, but also an artificial over-saturated glow, as if colors were boosted beyond their limits. There are scenes of true artistry that give this film a distinctive allure ( the staging of the actual shipwreck sequence, the surprise meeting of the boy and his tiger aboard the small lifeboat, a surrealistic hallucination that is filled with stark imagery, the colorful sunsets and ominous cloud reflecting upon the waters ). These effects do create an otherworldly atmosphere, which I suppose was Lee's goal, but the film's onslaught of phantasmagoric dreamscapes becomes excessive and outweighs the slenderest of plots: a philosophical and spiritual parable about a boy and his tiger lost at sea. This paradoxic metaphor is the basis conceit that enables the director and his screenwriter to explore the deeper meaning of religion, faith, and God that, in the end, makes Life of Pi become a preachy treacle, continually musing about our existence in this vast universe. ( Recent films by major directors like Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life, Lars van Trier's Melancholia, and the recent Cloud Atlas by the Wachowskis have explored this territory with similar mixed results. So one cannot fault Ang Lee with his passion and determination to film this novel and its metaphysical ruminations. ) Ultimately where Lee's film fails is in its conventional storytelling. The screenplay literally sinks the movie. Its script by David Magee rambles on and is especially slow-moving in the first half hour of the film with all its tedious exposition and build-up prior to the shipwreck. Based on Yann Martel's novel, the plot set-up is told in flashback, with the adult Pi bookending the more exciting adventure storyline. As he narrates his tale of survival, the character of the younger Pi ( Suraj Sharma ) emerges, but he is never fully realized. He is merely a pawn in this sea of woe. More time and success is spent on the exquisite photo-realistic rendering of Bengal tiger nicknamed Richard Parker. The CGI enhanced Mr. Parker gives a more lifelike performance and upstages the real life actor, Mr. Sharma, who could use some acting lessons. This imbalance sacrifices a real emotional gravitas needed to really care about the central character which I found completely missing in the film. ( In fact, the tiger had a lot more patience that I would have had if I was on that lifeboat and had to subject myself to Pi's religious rants and whining. He clearly would have been dinner by midday. ) Life of Pi is slightly adrift, a film full of excesses and self-important swagger. Lee overindulges his vision and seems more preoccupied in creating an ethereal world that is quite beautiful and strange to behold but, contrary to his own beliefs, it is also quite annoying to experience all of its religious dogma too. The overall effect of Life of Pi is a mixed blessing, so to speak. Life of Pi is a visually impressive achievement in filmmaking, but it remains intellectually and emotionally off-course. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Years ago, there was a wonderful film based on a children's novel called The Black Stallion which followed a similar storyline: a boy and an animal are shipwrecked and need each other to survive the hardships they face together. That film used a visual, almost wordless narrative to connect story and imagery; this film relies too heavily on the imagery to connect the pretentiousness of its hollow and holiest of words.","

"kosmasp","2 May 2015","I haven't read the novel this is based on, so I can't really compare the book with the finished movie. But I can say that the movie takes you on a journey. Something that has to be seen to be believed. Also one of the better 3D movies out there. This may rely on it's special effects, but never stirs away from the human story/emotion it tries (and successfully) conveys.It's also not too sugarcoated, showing animals like they are and not a cute version of them. Of course one could argue that maybe it's not the animals, but ... well if you've seen the movie, you know you can put a different layer on it and it works great. You can either enjoy the beautiful scenery and nice pace or see this as more ... it can be inspiring if you're in the mood for it ...","

"garyhvizdak","31 October 2013","Live of Pi was so bad that I'm at a loss as to how to review it. Here's a list of a few things that were wrong with this production.The way the story was told (as a flashback over dinner) could not have been more boring.Filling the blackboard at school with digits added absolutely nothing to the story line and seemed like an afterthought.All scenes with animals looked totally fake, including Pi's initial interactions with the tiger.Pi's behavior on the boat deck during the storm made no sense and seemed like an LSD trip.None of Pi's actions on the raft made any sense. It seemed as if he did everything he possibly could to ensure that he would not survive.Nothing about the island made any sense.In summary, it is as if everyone involved with this movie from start to finish was on drugs the entire time. There's really no other plausible explanation as to how something so bad could have ever seen the light of day.","

"lee_eisenberg","21 April 2013","In the grand scheme of things, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is about moving on to the next stage of one's life. Pi Patel's having to share a lifeboat with a Bengali tiger practically turns him into a new person. The movie's visuals have to be seen to be believed.Ang Lee had already had some impressive achievements with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"", and he continues with this movie. It is just not a movie that I can describe. The one scene that was a little weird was when Gérard Depardieu appeared as the cook (a big name in a small role interfered with the movie's plot). But otherwise it's a really good movie. I recommend it.","

"Whimsynsolence","27 November 2012","I watched the movie 'Life of Pi' today, it was fascinating. I was not able to think while the movie was playing because the incredible imagery continuously running in front of me, didn't provide me with the sufficient time to think. Yes, the book says that he was stranded in the sea for 277 days, well, the movie showed this extent of 277 days in less than 2 hours. Though, the story is fictional (yeahh! I know it says that this is based on a true story), so imagination has a greater scope. But, in the second attempt of his story, he implies that he was the tiger who ate the co-passengers in his life-boat, including his mother, the cook and whosoever he states were with them. Even in the first scene, where the hyena attacked the zebra and the orangutan, it angered Pi. Pi rose to attack it and suddenly, a Tiger catapulted itself to the open and attacked it. This may symbolize that the tiger in Pi rose to life at that moment. Well, remember what Pi's father had told him when for the first time he made an attempt to feed flesh to the tiger. Can't remember the quote word-to-word, but it did mention that you can see your emotions in the eyes of the tiger. Blah! The child (Pi, of course), who has digested 3 religions at once could also assimilate the very notion that 'the reflection-of-emotions' can be vice verse i.e., the tiger's emotions could reflect within him too (Read this line twice to make better sense of it).Next, it killed and ate the hyena first. As that was the time when he was experimenting with new meat, he tried the human flesh (as they were dead). Please note, 277 days! So, he ate his mother and then the cook (don't remember the other character he mentioned though). So here we see, that Pi became cannibalistic. Later on, he hunted fish and ate them for the next few days. I was not able to think all this when the movie was running because the scenes were running so fast, that, I hardly got the time to digest any of it. That is why Hollywood (I dono under what category this movie comes under) movies seem believable, because, it doesn't give you the time to think.The visit to the Carnivore Island was the best part of the movie for me, just for its sheer representation of multiple symbolism. One thing I noticed was that it characterized Lord Vishnu, who is sleeping in the ocean on Anantha (the poisonous snake). The very reason that the roots of the trees were entangled and looked as though it was crawling represented this very notion of the snake. The image over all, looked like a person sleeping - Lord Vishnu. It represented his form (the island) to be the life-giver in the morning (when the Lord must be sleeping), while at night, the island becomes acidic and kills all life forms on it, the Lord is asleep then, the poisonous snake feature is activated. So, this must be one of the crazy ideas behind this (and yes, I appreciate it). Well, heard a myth that the Tirumala hills which has the Tirupathi temple in its abode, which is in Andhra Pradesh, India. This temple has 7 hills surrounding it. Some amazing person found the shape of the hill to be the shape of the Tirupathi Venkateshwara's face. You can have a look at the picha (in the link below). The Carnivorous island has a similar concept as that of the pic of the hills. Well, there is a saying/belief that one day, all the wild (carnivorous) animals would come down this hill and attack humans. This will happen when the Lord would wake up. Don't worry it is a saying.The very reason Pi-fellow could come up with such a fascinating story is because, he has read 3 religious texts and understood the best way to narrate a thing that could sound realistic and yet exploit the reader/viewer's brain. This maybe the link with his interest with the religious text, and the dichotomy of being a cannibal.While watching the movie it made me feel that Pi is so heroic and he had survived it all. But, now I feel bitter for his act of cannibalism. His lies/truth... blah! it is a fiction. No need to ponder anymore. Well, I loved the movie and I will be watching it again. *giggles*","

"boothkaren20","7 January 2013","I found this film ultimately unsatisfying. Granted, it is visually stunning, but that in itself doesn't justify the running time. I found myself wondering what the point of the film was at all. If I'm right,it is a pseudo mystical / philosophical propaganda piece, which suggests that it is better to hold tight to a fantastical, improbable story of triumph over adversity (ie your faith in God, whoever that is), if it gives you hope and gets you through life – rather than to endure a harsh, unpalatable reality. The whole film is geared up to asking the question of the viewer – which do you prefer, the outlandish fantasy or the grim truth? I'm not sure it's even answerable, unless you have a faith which you want to reaffirm. So when the question came, I thought ""Is that it? Is that what you've been waiting to pose""? The majority of the film covers a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck, cast away on a small lifeboat in the company of a Bengal tiger. The story is told in retrospective by the boy (Pi) as an adult. It is clear to the viewer that this is a tall tale, from Pi's general style of story telling (a colourful childhood, an eccentric swimming-obsessed uncle). We can tell that his style is somewhat unreliable. Therefore I didn't exactly buy into the survival story. I wasn't rooting for him and there was no emotional attachment to the character, in the way there would have been if this was a straight forward recounting of what happened. What I was thinking was ""when is this part going to end, so that I can get on with finding out what's really going on in the film""? By that, I don't mean that I was particularly interested in the true survival story, which when it came was pretty grim (although that might have been a more interesting film!). I really wanted to know why the film maker thought it was so important to take us on this fantastical journey. When the answer came, in all its semi-philosophical shallowness, it wasn't worth the wait.","

"vicarious_tool","24 November 2012","I believe I have never seen a movie as picturesque and visually delightful as this one. It' a treat for the eyes, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, since this combined with the amazing coming of age story and good acting, dialogues makes this a great watch for everyone.The plot is nicely paced, maybe a little slow for some, but I feel that is necessary to hook one in and make the emotions portrayed feel true. However thanks to 'Richard Parker' there is also an element of thrill that keeps you on the edge time and again. These is a certain kind of purity to the story, but without compromising on subtlety and elegance. The scenes portrayed i.e. nighttime, sunsets, the lightning and storms, the exquisite variety of animals, underwater scenes; the rare but amazing quips and the beautiful analogy used as a 'proof of god' all on the whole left me strangely content when the movie ended, i.e. without the nagging need for 'more' that some good stories often leave behind.","

"marksez","28 April 2013","This is a spectacular movie, and those are rare these days.How could anyone not like this movie and its story? The special effects are almost seamless and the fitting together of ""real"" moments and moments that must be fantasy (the lake-like calm clear ocean in a dreamlike sequence, the floating island, as examples).So, it borrows a bit from ""Castaway"" with the storm, the sinking vessel, the whale, landing on an island, to name a few examples, it still holds our attention throughout and does everything else superbly.And of course the zinger is the twist at the end when we learn that the entire story we just watched may be a metaphor for what really happened, and we are given the choice of which story to choose. That's a nice bit of Twilight Zoniness that adds a great touch.I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I knew it had gotten a lot of good press, but that is no guarantee of a good movie. This one earns all of the good stuff people say about it.","

"blanbrn","6 December 2012","Every once and awhile you have a film that comes along like that of ""Life of Pi"" one that's a tale of courage, wit, determination, and a survival tale it shows that life was worth living as it's often an unexpected and tough unusual journey. Told mostly in flashback form you now have a grown Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan)and Pi recalls the times and days of his India zoo keeper family. And the most life changing and memorable moment that would shape Pi's life is when his family took a ship movement to Canada only to be wrecked by a sea disaster in the Pacific ocean. After the wicked waves of the Pacific have departed Pi's family on the lifeboat he's left with his most notable zoo animals like a zebra, hyena, orangutan and most watched is a fierce growling grown to love Bengal tiger. Along the way this is a cat and mouse game of will and survival for Pi to live it shows that on an unexpected journey skill and wit can be learned for survival. Aside from the film's personal themes of will and determination the special effects are top notch. And any work from award winning director Ang Lee is a story of discovery and love obtaining and ""Life of Pi"" sums up those things. Overall this film is a tribute to courage, wit and the will for survival.","

"itamarscomix","3 March 2013","The little I knew about Life of Pi before seeing it - a young Indian man is stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger - couldn't in any way prepare me for what I was about to see. The truly amazing thing is that that's pretty much all there is to it. Ang Lee weaves an incredible amount of emotion and depth into a very minimalistic, poetic story, and for that reason Life of Pi may be the most impressive cinematic achievement of the year - it's true cinema, a film that doesn't rely on a complex plot, shocking twists or tons of characters, but simply on coherent, free-flowing storytelling, beautiful images and utter precision. There's not a wasted minute or an unnecessary shot - the special effects are impressive but always subtle enough to leave center stage for the story. The film is incredibly easy to get into, it's constantly interesting, it's simple yet deep, and it leaves a lasting impression and plenty of room for debate - really, what more can you want from a film? Ang Lee is proving time after time that while he hasn't become a brand name like Spielberg and Tarantino, he's one of the most fascinating directors working today, mainly because he doesn't make the same film twice; Life of Pi is a perfect example to use when demonstrating how important a director is, and how much a good director can do with a very lean and (on the surface) plain script. Lee always had an eye for beautiful imagery, though, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography in Life of Pi makes for some of the most beautiful yet; not only the bulk of the film that takes place in the middle of the ocean and is dominated by CGI, but also the live action segments, especially the first thirty minutes. The opening sequence in particular is one of the most gorgeous I've seen in years, and while watching it in 3D makes the immersion a bit quicker, it's by no means essential and it's impossible to not get lost in the film, no matter how you watch it.A quick word on religion: I've heard about some people who avoid Life of Pi because, as atheists, they reject the religious undertones. I'm a devout atheist myself, and enjoyed it immensely, and I encourage other atheists to watch it too. The film has a spiritual undertone, yes, but it doesn't force salvation down the viewer's throat like some other films. In fact, I don't recall seeing another film that made me feel so sympathetic towards believers; it portrays religion in an ambivalent, affectionate yet critical way, and it leaves quite a lot up to the viewer's interpretation. It also makes a point of showing that, while religion has its purposes and can be of great help to people in tough situations, the division and hate between believers in different brands of religion is the thing that messes everything up, which is a message that I, as an atheist, related to. All religion, Life of Pi says, is pretty much the same - it's a way of coloring reality, of making it easier to handle and seeing the beautiful side of it. Like stories, and like films. Life of Pi is an ode to storytellers, be they Pi, the originators of religion or Ang Lee itself, and it's one of the most beautiful pieces of storytelling you'll see.","

"Fields201","23 November 2012","Life of Pi is one of those films that you would think about leaving the theater and would stick with you for a long while. It has a lasting appeal, and a great ending that is not often seen in films these days as most film endings suck.It didn't start out strong though as we follow an older Pi telling his story to a journalist. He covers the younger years of his life, and if anyone has ever seen The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, you will know that his earlier years is fairly boring. We discover why his name is Pi, and its from a swimming pool. Okay. It isn't until he gets older where we finally see him on that boat and that big tidal wave hits, and the imagery is astounding. Pi is thrust into a lifeboat and this is really where our movie begins. Pi is trapped on a boat with animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a fierce tiger. In fact, most of the movie is spent with Pi surviving hunger and not being eaten by this tiger in the middle of the ocean. What a great concept! It's also narrated by Pi, and its fantastic!If there is one complaint that I think most people would agree on is the use of very heavy CG. You can almost say there is too much CG and what is some beautiful cinematography. The tiger especially as it looks very good, but at times you can tell it was CG. You would notice this on a scene on a beach where the tiger is walking. The movement seems a little off and it ruins some of the realism on what could have been a very emotional scene.I can't recommend Life of Pi enough though. There's so many things I could say about it and it is a fantastic journey that if I saw it as a kid, it would be one of those movies I look back on and love even just for nostalgia sake. I'm seeing it again with my mom. This is one journey I think everyone should experience!","

"CinemaClown","9 December 2012","A visual extravaganza from start to finish, Life of Pi is an enthralling journey of adventure, hope & triumph of the will to survive against all odds that's as rewarding an experience visually as it is emotionally, benefits immensely from Ang Lee's assured direction, and features some truly jaw-dropping moments of beauty & wonder. A captivating take on religion, faith & nature, it is one of the best films of 2012 & arguably the most beautiful.","

"Rollum","22 February 2013","As soon as The Life of Pi started and the opening scene unfolded i was drawn in and i stayed there for the entire movie. I cant recall a single moment in this film where i was not engaged and on many levels. From the beginning there was a point and a meaning. I felt that i was discovering something special throughout the movie. Director Ang Lee has captured a magic in this film. Suraj Sharma as Pi the cast away was truly authentic. Irrfan Khan was subtle and mesmerizing as adult Pi. A brilliant screen play and amazing CGI made this a film experience i have not had for sometime. The incredible thing about The Life of Pi is that its able to encompass all the complexities of faith and religion in a story that seems so simple in it conclusion. I didn't see Life of Pi in 3D but i was simply blown away by the beauty of the story and that is that faith is a matter of choice.","

"Buddy-51","15 March 2014","In an era in which CGI has made it possible to put virtually anything one could possibly imagine up on the screen, it has become harder and harder for a filmmaker to make an audience's collective jaw drop. But Ang Lee achieves just that with his adaptation of Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi."" This movie truly has what we, in modern parlance, like to refer to as ""the wow factor,"" simply because it is unlike anything we've seen on screen before. ""Life of Pi"" is a surrealistic tale of survival about an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a ferocious Bengal tiger for a companion. The first thought we are struck with while watching ""Life of Pi"" is that this movie would have been impossible to make prior to the CGI revolution in filmmaking. With so many movies abusing that technology for sheer commercial ends, it's gratifying to see a film actually using it for thought-provoking and artistic purposes (see also ""Gravity""). At times brutally harsh while at others gloriously lyrical, the movie combines the realistic with the fantastical, the rational with the spiritual - all to illustrate the many disparate and dichotomous elements that, working in glorious chaotic tandem, make up this vast expanse we call the universe. The first third of the film focuses on Pi's life before the shipwreck. Pi (short for Piscine, which as it shares a rather unfortunate homonym in English, causes Pi at a very early age to abbreviate it) is innately curious about not only the world around him but the world that lies beyond the physical. He is so fascinated with the spiritual, in fact, that he has adopted the tenets of each of the world's major religions and made them his own. Pi lives with his stern, skeptical father (Adil Hussain), his more open-minded, sympathetic mother (Tabu) and his somewhat less curious older brother (who is played by three different actors in various stages of the story). One of the prime exhibits in the zoo owned by Pi's father is a Bengal tiger that, through a bureaucratic fluke, has been tagged with the name Richard Parker, a prosaic moniker hardly befitting the king of the jungle. When the father decides to sell the zoo, the family, along with the animals, board a Japanese freighter to begin a new life in Canada (the plan is to sell the animals once they get there). On the way, however, tragedy strikes when the ship sinks in a tremendous storm, sending all but Pi and Richard Parker to the bottom of the sea. ""Life of Pi"" is the story of their survival.Alternately awe-inspiring, heartbreaking and suspenseful, the screenplay by David Magee expands on the ""circle of life"" metaphor to explore how each element of nature is interlocked with every other element, with each action prompting a reaction unto infinity. Though natural born ""enemies,"" Pi and Richard Parker achieve a kind of symbiosis, ultimately forced to rely on one another for survival (RP for his physical needs, Pi for his spiritual), and in so doing, they achieve a harmony that puts them in sync with the rest of the universe. Yet, for all its pantheistic elements, the movie doesn't over-sentimentalize nature, doesn't shy away from showing us the unthinking brutality that is also a part of that universe, underlined by the fact that living creatures can survive only by feeding on other living creatures. It certainly never downplays the very real danger Pi is in at every moment from his feline companion. This cat may be animated, but he's no cartoon character.Never one to shy away from a challenge, Lee won a second Best Director Oscar for his work here, and someday the Academy might even see fit to bestow a Best Picture award on him as well (he was certainly robbed of that honor for ""Brokeback Mountain""). As he has done many times before, Lee demonstrates a total command of the medium in ""Life of Pi."" There's a hallucinatory quality to much of the film, as Pi frequently experiences preternatural visions that transcend the confines of the material world and of rational thought, leading him to a oneness with God. Suraj Shama has been handed the challenge - one might almost call it the burden - of carrying large stretches of this film entirely on his own, with only a CGI effect to interact with. It is a challenge the gifted young actor is more than equipped to handle and he fulfills it beautifully.Though the movie throws the audience for a loop at the end, making us question the veracity of the tale the adult Pi (Irrfan Kahn) is relating to the writer (Rafe Spall) who hopes to chronicle the experience, no one can ever convince the true believer in all of us that this is anything other than a love story between a boy and a tiger. After all - thanks to the technical wizards who've made it all possible - we've seen it with our own eyes.","

"Laakbaar","29 December 2012","I found this to be a beautiful, enigmatic and meaningful movie. In the end, the cinematography is what stands out for me. The landscape and village in India, the vividness of the shipwreck, the scenes of the ocean (and the wondrous things that occur there) and the algae island -- it was all quite beautiful.Ang Lee also did a fantastic job in showing how the main premise of the book (i.e. a boy stuck on a life boat with a tiger) could actually work. I simply couldn't buy into this metaphor until Lee showed it to me on film.It's astonishing how lifelike the computer-generated tiger was. The whole movie hinged on this. It worked brilliantly.How many of the beautiful images were real? It's so well done that I really do not know. It's possible that most of the movie was computer generated. A cartoon, essentially. If so, it was technically brilliant, but it leaves me wondering about the film going experience. What did I just see exactly? Related to that are my reservations about the realism of the ocean scenes. Beautiful, yes, but do such things actually happen on the ocean? I'm still not sure. I'd like to know.What was the religious message of the movie? We are told that it delivers a profound message, but I'm afraid I couldn't really get it from the movie itself. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but should a movie have the effect of making you scurry to the internet to find out what it means? The metaphors here were too complicated.I suspect this movie might speak more to the faithful, or at least to people whose minds are still open to faith. I'm afraid I'm on the same side as appa and amma, and this movie did not convince me otherwise. This is a movie with a profound message, but it's a message I didn't quite get and I think I reject, the artistry notwithstanding.I have to add that, although I am easily moved, this film did not move me. It did not really evoke an emotional reaction in me (apart from wonder at the beauty). That's the main reason for my score. On this point the movie failed for me. Perhaps I need to see it again, but I didn't empathise with the main character (either the younger or older versions). I'm not sure why though.To me, the twist at the end complicated the movie enormously and raised disturbing issues. Yes, I would have preferred to see the movie about a tiger rather than the alternative, but how on earth does that relate to religion? I'm sorry, but I didn't get it. Yes, faith and your particular religion are choices, but so is the decision to reject faith and religion as superstition. And I long ago rejected the notion that the grandeur of nature, or the beauty of art, is proof of God's existence. That is nonsense.To be honest with you, if Ang Lee had filmed the alternative version in the same beautiful way, perhaps that would have been a good movie too. I might have preferred a more realistic horror-adventure film. Or is there some rule of cinematography that a movie like that would have to be ugly because of its theme? There is beauty in evil too.But I write this review as someone who has not read the book, so what do I know.","

"psheehan78","25 November 2012","This is a three hour movie but you'll swear you were in the theater for at least 12. I don't normally mind long movies but this one was pretty slow and boring. My sister fell asleep for half of it but my brother and I were not as fortunate. There were some sporadic entertaining parts and the 3D had it's moments but that's no reason to torture yourself for the other 2 1/2 hours. Just when you think the movie is about to wrap up, the guy starts telling another story! I almost walked out right then and actually wish I did because the ending is what really made me feel cheated. *Spoiler* So you're telling me the entire story you just wasted my time with was a complete lie? I felt bad for the guy that was following him around all over the place listening to his BS for hours and hours. I think I would've probably punched him in the face. I have a history of missing the point of these artistic movies but I don't understand how lying about what happened when you got shipwrecked makes anyone closer to God.I'm going to use this technique on my girlfriend. Honey, I went to the store to buy you a gift when I was kidnapped by a unicorn that flew me to a magical island with perfume flowers and lipstick bushes. Then I killed the unicorn and escaped on a giant pterodactyl that scratched up my back and dropped me off just in time for breakfast.Oh, you don't like that story? How about, I went to the bar, got wasted and went home with some other chick last night?I've told you two stories that both result in me not coming home last night. Both stories end with me having a scratched back, lipstick on my face and neck, and smelling of perfume. Which story would you prefer? Do you believe in god now?","

The actors had flow and genuineness in movements and speech, not to mention that the stunning visual effects contributed in such a tremendous way to the story itself. It reminds me of a Romanian dramatic parable, Iona, but instead of the character being eaten by multiple fishes, talking to himself and losing his inner soul, here we face the opposite, a young and brave boy who gets over any difficulty and who finds his true identity in life by overcoming forces that are not of his league. I truly recommend it to anyone, because it brings joy to the soul and peace to the mind.","

"livoentertainment","2 May 2022","Life Of Pi is slow, Faux artsy and Faux Deep, and not always gripping or compelling. But, most of it's missteps are outweighed by the absolute audio visual symphony it offers. Filled with beautiful cinematography and Touching music to back, It's at times fascinating and Hopeful. It's not exactly profound, could be even shallow, and it's not exactly fantastic, But it's still a fairly well made film based on a fairly well written novel.","

"jburtroald95","7 January 2013","Ang Lee, the Taiwanese director of films such as Sense and Sensibility (2000) and Lust Caution (2007), has decided to give his latest maturely themed feature the visual aesthetic of a charming children's adventure tale. As such, all trailers, posters and inattentively viewed clips of the film make it seem like the perfect holiday fodder for little ones. The parents who brought their toddlers to the session of Life of Pi that I went to weren't entirely incorrect in their assumptions. It is a magical movie, it does tell a fanciful story, and the effect on its audience is altogether uplifting, but the fantastical element is laid on top of a hard, heavy realism that pokes through more than one might expect. The real world isn't blocked out of the piece like an escapist kid's film: it is contrasted against the spiritual fantasy as a way of showing, not telling, its audience why people turn to religion even when modern science seems to constantly conflict with it.Young Pi Patel (played by Gautam Belur, and then Ayush Tandon as an 11- to-12-year-old) has been fascinated by religion since he tried to vandalise a catholic church in rural India, where he and his family own an extensive zoo, and encountered astonishing Christian forgiveness. Since then he has also become a Muslim, and confounded his strict father (Adil Hussain) and the young author (Rafe Spall) that he relates his tale too, which we see in extended flashbacks, with his apparent juvenile miscomprehension that is actually an insightful observation that Hinduism, Islamism and Christianity all really achieve the same end, and simply imagine God in different forms. The interspersed scenes between the reminiscing adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) and the curious writer mostly feel as artificial and unnecessary as such setups always are, with the exception of the protagonist's poignant account of the melancholy end to his relationship with Richard Parker, the fierce but magnificent tiger that everyone has seen on the posters, and his introductory proclamation to the writer that this is a story that will make him believe in God, and I suppose there needs to be someone there for him to say this to, but anyone would do.It takes a surprisingly long time for the teenage Pi (played extraordinarily well by first-timer Suraj Sharma) to be on the lifeboat alone with Richard out on the open ocean wearing a turban, there being a considerable early portion of the film devoted to his family life, but the introduction of the prevalent theme of spirituality runs throughout and the bloodthirsty beauty of the big cat are crucial elements that come from these scenes. Even the mundane, but still mildly interesting, family exchanges, depictions of his school life – where we discover the amusing origin of his name – and a mercifully brief, obligatory romantic sub-plot, are necessary to again show us, not tell us, of his pain when he loses all of this in a shipwreck at about the halfway-point, and begins a compelling and visually stunning fight for his life against the elements, and the astonishingly realised tiger. All of the animals in the film are totally convincing, but it is especially impressive that all sides of the this incredible predator – his strength, his hunger, his nobility, his desperation, his feline grace – are all captured so beautifully, making the multi-faceted symbiotic relationship between the animal and his keeper so totally engrossing. Their gruelling search for land is depicted warts, and quite a few of those hideous warts, which may have been even more unrestrainedly gritty in the original novel by Yann Martel, were quickly driving all of those toddlers out of the cinema before any of them could discover how Pi's tale could defrost a person's rigid atheism, and a good thing too. The trick doesn't lie in his miraculous survival – that would have probably lost the other, older half of the underage audience – but in the very grisly, hard-hitting alternative ""real"" version of events that Pi tells a pair of reporters that don't believe the version we've seen, which is very reminiscent of John Steinbeck's Lifeboat, for which the fantastical tale seems to be an allegory. When Pi asks, ""So which story do you prefer?"" the hearts of both us and the writer of course unhesitatingly answer ""the one with the tiger,"" before our brains can interfere with shallow logical cynicism.While not for very little ones, parents should certainly take children past their single-digit years to see this wonderful telling of a robust but wondrous story of biblical beauty.","

"jonnyfendi","16 December 2012","Thiz is a simple movie with stunning visual portrayal of a spiritual journey. It starts like Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" (2003) where everything is odd and magical, steps like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008) with its compelling flashback in storytelling and it feels like Tom Hank's ""Cast Away"" (2000), only thiz time the survivor is not accompanied by Wilson the volleyball, but with something called Richard Parker. It is a courageous adventure story about a young boy named Piscine (Suraj Sharma), who unfortunately lost all his family in sinking ship. His survival effort along with all the animals, especially with a ferocious Bengal tiger, brings him to an understanding of life as a whole. The newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sufficient performance to describe a boy who has to survive nature. Adil Hussain and Tabu make brief but memorable appearances as Pi's father and mother. On the other hand, I think that Irrfan Khan could have been better as Adult Pi. His central role as the storyteller is just enough, not extraordinary, not even close, compared to Gloria Stuart as Old Rose in ""Titanic"" (1997). Ang Lee who is formerly known as the Director of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), ""Hulk"" (2003) and the controversial drama ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), wrapping thiz movie with astonishing visual treat. ""The Storm Scene"" is one of the remarkable moments in thiz movie. I bet you won't get thiz experience before in any other movies. Thiz is something that you have never seen before, followed by other scenes like ""The Giant Whale Scene"", ""The Flying Fish Scene"" and my favorite ""The Exotic Meerkat Island"". I think thiz movie has lots of powerful philosophies all over the place. It's like metaphor in metaphor, there comes a point in everyone's life, thiz will be something that needs to be thought about. It's emotionally gratifying. Actually, the movie is not just about survival, it's not even about the sinking ship, and it's definitely not about the tiger. It's simply about your relationship with God. In the end, we know very well. In every spiritual journey, your greatest enemy is none other than yourself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com","

"cosmo_tiger","10 February 2013","""He said you had a story that would make me believe in God."" Pi (Sharma) is a young man living in India trying to find himself. After discovering Krishna he finds Jesus and has to convince his family he is serious about it. When his family falls on hard times they decide to sell their zoo and move to Canada. When an epic storm hits the boat they are traveling on everyone but Pi is lost. Now on a life boat with only a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker to keep him company he must figure out where he is and how to get to land. I have said before that 90% of the way you feel about a movie is the expectations you had for it going in. I expected this to be boring and I was not excited about it at all. Almost from the beginning it had me interested and by the end had totally won me over. This is nothing like I expected at all. The movie is very religious and extremely deep and very thought provoking. By the end you are questioning everything you saw and leaves you wondering what to believe. That is the sign of a good movie, one that leaves you thinking about it long after its over. While I don't think this is the best picture of the year I did like it much much more then I expected and will say its one of the best of the year. Not bad for a movie that I expected to fall asleep watching. Overall, surprisingly good and very much worth seeing, you will be surprised like I was, the trailer does not do the film justice. I give it an A-.","

"adamshl","24 November 2012","This film is so beautiful to see, and the director's production so enthralling, that it rather grieves me to criticize the work, but that I'm compelled to do.The problem with this is that the adult Pi's interpretation of his adventures both confuses and undermines the narrative. He (and writer) are so committed to making this interpretation as vague and general as possible that it leaves one in limbo.Likewise such things as the ""canivorous island"" sequence dips into the fantasy idiom, which conflicts with its realistic content, making for muddled genre.Finally, in an effort to be inclusive regarding Pi's religious background, the writer chose to specify particular religions, thereby muddling the narrative's purity. It would have been better to dramatize the spirituality rather than specify it by naming names. This later limits the story's universality and further complicates the narrative's purpose.By keeping things as vague as possible, I'm sure many viewers think there's something deep here . . . something mystical and of a high plane. Actually I see it as a smoke screen for appearance sake and special effect.Still, the director's production is at such a high technical level that the film must be correctly be called ""good.""","

"Treyroo","20 December 2012","What would you do if you found yourself orphaned, alone and in the middle of the ocean? Drown, surrender, pray? Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator. We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.","

"J_Charles","3 April 2014","LOTS OF SPOILERS BELOW: in the DVD extras Ang Lee is quoted as challenging the CGI Tech team to create moving works of art. And boy did they ever deliver.In a film like this where the ocean dominates the scenery and in itself becomes a ""character"" and antagonist it is important to have it rendered well and here it is brilliant. So vibrant and realistic.That's just part of the fun. The tiger is amazing. It's hard to believe it's mostly CGI. And the acting by the young Pi is also incredible, especially when watching the extras and seeing him; eyes fully bugged out in terror at the tiger, while staring at a green screen.The story line seems bare but when you think about the raw emotions being delivered on screen it really hits home. the maturation of the young boy into a survivalist young man is quite an epic adventure.The ending - well I'll leave that alone. It' quite the twist and really makes you think hard about what's true, what's a representation of the truth. When he asks at the end ""which do you like better"" I started re-thinking about what it was I had just watched. And I think that's the mark of a great film.9/10","

"eonbluedan-1","22 December 2012","Pi Patel, played for the most part by Suraj Sharma with a confidence defying his absolute inexperience in front of the camera, and surely qualifying him for a Best Actor nod at the Oscars, is thrust into an adventure of survival at sea. The ship carrying his family and their zoo hits bad waters, inexplicably sinks, and from there he must learn how to share the confined space of a lifeboat with his only companion, a tiger named Richard Parker.Like 'Cast Away', due to its idea a great deal of the film is without speech, save for Pi's one way conversations with the animal and the occasional narration by adult Pi, played by a spectacular Irrfan Khan, who is telling his tale to an author, one who is after a great story that will ""make you believe in God"". Also much like another of this year's spectaculars, 'The Hobbit', the front end of the movie is loaded with a lot of setup, which those who who only saw the trailer may find surprisingly hefty. Unlike 'The Hobbit', however, this front end engages you fast and it is not long before you are enjoying the development of Pi as a character, the amusing finding of his faith, his love, and his place in the family. Some genuinely hearty and smart humour can be found in this first act, also. The brilliance is that whilst it is not in any rush to get where we all know it is headed, at no point is there any wish for Lee to push it along faster; there is some understanding intrinsic to the direction that this is all important and not to be overlooked, which even those who have not read the hugely popular book pick up on. To add to this, it must be said that the length and pacing of this movie is outstanding; you would not want any more or less time spent basking in the warmth of the love and care that clearly went into putting every single gorgeous frame on the screen. The second act is where we really see the film kick into gear and start rolling out what is stunning audiences and critics alike. From the greatest CGI animal I think I have seen on the silver screen, to the overwhelmingly beautiful photography, effects, and perhaps not the first, but certainly the best use of 3D technology to enhance the engagement with a story, 'Life Of Pi' sweeps the floor visually with anything previously held up as a bar setter. Nothing against those previous movies, but it really does. All of this is obviously nothing without everything else being in place, and thankfully Ang Lee knows that the heart of his film is not how pretty it is, but the story by Yann Martel and the themes with which it deals. So what is 'Life Of Pi' about? The wonderful thing about this piece is that this answer could be different for you than it was for me. It is about a boy surviving at sea with a tiger. It is about the nature of life, death and loss. It is about the balance of fear and respect. It is about love and hope. It is about humanity and compassion. It is about religion and faith, faith not just in a higher power, but in anything in the world. It is about all of these things at once, but what I most took away from this film is how it is about the nature of nature itself. Yes, it sounds heavy and preachy, doesn't it? The truth is Lee gets the balance absolutely spot on; you take from the movie what you want and at no point does it preach at you about anything. It does not matter how you walk in, an atheist, a Hindu, a Christian, but if you are a human being with anything close to an open heart and mind, you might just walk out feeling a better person! Released for the festive season, it is an oddly uplifting film that entertains on one hand, and on the other is positively philosophical about our place in nature, our treatment of her, and of one another. Not often would I say that a film might just change your life, but as the film reached its finale, with both Sharma and Khan absolutely owning their respective final scenes, I realised I had been inescapably moved to tears more than once, had consciously assessed how I think about certain things, and that yes, this film just might change you for the better. Is the preceding challenge to make a character believe in God achieved? That would be telling, but more importantly, it does not matter; in a rather smart bit of writing and beautiful execution, the film underlines that this is not really the point, and indeed should never be. Ang Lee is a man who directs with a heart full of compassion, and a head full to its brim with an understanding of cinema's sheer power to entertain, engage and challenge, sometimes all at once. A look at his previous work is evidence enough of this; sure, not everything is a hit, but never could his passion for cinema, bravery and humanity, be more on show than with 'Life Of Pi'. He has done what was said to be impossible, taken a book that should never have translated to cinema, and not only made a successful film, but made the all-round best spectacular to hit the big screen since Nolan's 'Inception'! A loss at the Oscars for its visuals and adaption for screen, at the very least, would be a sin! Regardless of one's reaction to the movie, Ang Lee may well have created his masterpiece.","

"jcslawyer","1 August 2020","From the opening montage until the start of the credits, it's as if you're watching a beautiful painting manifesting from someone's imagination. Cinematography excellent. Use of color, extraordinary. It's a movie you can't take your eyes off of. You'd bring it to pee or poo so you don't have to pause it!The story is rather simple, but of course there's a lot going on under the surface as introduced early in the film. Pi is not your ordinary child. From a young age, he's pondered, questioned, and sought guidance spiritually, but isn't sure precisely where to find them. Instead of picking one, he picks them all as that is how it helps him try to understand things outside of the realm of comprehension.This desire to learn more and more comes to an abrupt stop when he has a moment with his parents' zoo' tiger, Richard Parker. He feels that there is an understanding that can be had between he and the tiger, so he tries to feed by hand only to be stopped by his father. To teach him the lesson that tigers are just tigers, he forces Pi to watch a goat being fed to the tiger.Next sees the family decide to move to Canada. The father gets them passage on a Japanese boat, which includes the animals from their zoo that they intend to sell. During the voyage, Pi gets the unknown urge to go above deck to watch the storm. He asks his bro to accompany him, but he doesn't want to. Next thing you know, the boat is caught in the treacherous storm culminating in it sinking with his family aboard. There's a brief period where there are others attempting to procure a lifeboat for whomever they can, but Pi causes a delay in the process as he wants to locate his family who, likely, are already deceased. Somehow he gets on the lifeboat at the same time as a zebra who jumps onto it causing it to lower with only Pi and the zebra.During the commotion, Pi is trying to stay afloat and locate whomever he can with no success. During the ensuing hours, the tiger appears to join the boat, a hyena is discovered hiding, and an orangutan is seen floating atop some bananas.The hyena, having no sense of anything other than its hunting instincts, kills the zebra and orangutan. The tiger jumps out (even though no one was sure he was on there under the cloth tarp covering half the boat) and kills the hyena.No need to go into detail about the rest of the movie except to point out key things that seem to have people discussing the film's ending. The movie is told by an adult Pi to a man who was sent by Pi's uncle to get a story for a book he is writing. When Pi is rescued, he is asked by Japanese insurance adjusters what happened. Pi recounts the story, but they either don't believe or don't think others will believe. So Pi retells the story substituting himself for the tiger, a sailor for the zebra, a cook who was a jerk for the hyena, and his mom for the orangutan. The rest of the story though appears to remain the same thereafter, but we're not privy to the rest and we're not sure it's important. The man interviewing Pi asks which was real, to which Pi asks which does he want. The man says the one with animals to which Pi gives a cryptic reply. In either story, his family did not survive. Next you see Pi has a family and has offered his story to the man.So the question that leaves people pondering is which version was real. I've determined the story with animals is real. Everything he did on the journey was for the tiger along with himself. I don't see the metaphor as that being himself the whole time since he spent the journey trying to avoid the tiger by building a raft. One big piece of evidence was the story he was writing while on the boat. Yes, it ultimately gets blown away, but a large portion of that time was devoted to actually documenting the trip as what we see based on the animal version. There's nothing yo indicate that his mom survived shortly or other persons survived. He and the tiger never connect until the tiger and he are so close to exhaustion and dehydration that neither can think about the instinct to kill. When they ultimately reach the shore where Pi is rescued the tiger leaves without even acknowledging Pi. This directly connects to his father's lesson that it's just a tiger. That appears literal, not symbolic of himself. Otherwise the lesson by his father seems unnecessary. Pi does not come off as a conniver and we have no reason to believe he told the story to the man only to throw the other story out there. He told the story with people to please those guys so they'd leave him alone. It's worth noting that the article about him does include survival with a tiger. I didn't question whether it was real until the guy asks. I think Pi just told a story that was true, but when presented with the question of which was real, he allowed the man to choose which fits his needs. I think Pi is satisfied that his story was real. His mom did not survive. He was the only human survivor. Although there were things thrown in there to raise doubt about the authenticity (floating bananas, random island of meerkats), the bananas thing could've easily been misinterpreted as it was during a storm and intense time. Who cares. And just because no one's seen the island doesn't mean it doesn't exist. He saw all kinds of cool things that most people don't see. Him and the tiger never go beyond the relationship as established from the start. Nothing preternatural about it.Don't read too much into it. Pi told his story. The only time doubt is cast is when, during his story, he tells his story intentionally different to appease businessmen. He already told the truth, but they wouldn't relent without something so fantastic.Another reason I think the animal story was real. I've read sites that discuss details from the book that were not included in the movie. Apparently the books offers more details on the alternate story. The film skirts it in a minute or so. If we're truly led to question the two, why omit so much detail from the book? To me it was just a story to get rid of the Japanese men. That's why the filmmakers chose to not spend any additional time on that other than to give the man the ability to do what he feels is best for his story.Anyway excellent film.","

"kekca","17 January 2014","When I first saw this movie I thought that it is not good - some animals in a boat and that till the end. The second time I watched it I said to myself - ""it is good"". Long time after that fragmentary visions of it were coming back to my consciousness. They got sense undressed.Pi is not in relation with mathematics. But it can be interpret like this - a continuously revealing essence repeating on each manifestation. Strongly metaphorical it starts the story of life on a continent, in a family, on a ship with society, on a boat, in loneliness and in the end in a new family.It is a description of human life, of its connection with nature and its creations. Of not overcoming abyss between man, animals and plants for which Sartre tells us. Of relation with God or the internal sense. Of described fantasy and trivial people. Things in the life of almost everyone of us.In spite of the long period in the boat the spectator co-experience much and is informed much. Like his own existence. Of always dynamic but essential and most of all: his own.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/","

"amanda_lockworth","3 March 2013","This movie starts slow. The shipwreck scene at sea is only somewhat believable, if you allow yourself to be distracted by the CGI, but it drags, and the references to religion are just a mish-mash of ancient superstition that don't mesh well with the supposed story being told. In the end we learn there is possibly another story that is the ""truth"", and which is preferred? Well I liked neither. And neither story was ""true"" since all was fiction to begin with.""Life of Pi"" felt like a story that wanted to go somewhere but didn't know how to, like the author was Pi and trying to figure out how to write a story for the first time, hoping that the proposed alternate story at the end would give the time spent on the rest of the tale some sort of validity, which it didn't. It reminds me of a joke I heard a few years back, one of those jokes where I wondered why I wasted my time listening to it, and I will repeat it here, giving it a Life-of-Pi ending:One day, Juan is out trimming his hedges. His neighbor looks over and says, ""Juan, you're a great guy. You don't beat your wife, abuse your kids, or kick your dog. You should run for Mayor!""So Juan runs for Mayor. People see what a great guy he is, and they elect him.After his term is over, Juan is back out to his hedges. His neighbor looks over again. ""Juan, you're a great guy. You don't beat your wife, abuse your kids, or kick your dog. You should run for Senator!""So Juan runs for Senator. People see what a great guy he is, and they elect him.After his term is over, Juan is back out to his hedges. His neighbor looks over again. ""Juan, you're a great guy. You don't beat your wife, abuse your kids, or kick your dog. You should run for President!""So Juan runs for President. People see he's a great guy- doesn't beat his wife, abuse his kids, or kick his dog. So they elect him. However, as Juan is sitting in the Oval Office one day, a shady man in a black coat walks in and says, ""Juan, you're a great guy. But you need to start screwing up- beat your wife, abuse your kids, and start kicking your dog. Or I'll kill you."" So Juan begins to beat his wife, abuse his kids, and kick his dog. After a while of this, Juan's old neighbor comes in.""Juan, what are your doing? You used to be a great guy- now your family is gone and your dog has run away! You need to fix things up, or I'll kill you!""So Juan is freaking out, but he decides to go out with honor. He patches things up with his wife and kids, and he gets a new dog. The next day, the shady man comes into his office and shoots Juan with a golf gun.What's a golf gun? -I don't know, but it sure made a hole in Juan.That was a stupid joke -Which do you like better, the stupid joke or ""Life of Pi?""The stupid joke -So it is with God.","

"jj_spicer","18 February 2013","I went into Life of Pi not knowing anything about it. I'd seen trailers, and assumed it was a ""Jungle Book on Water"" sort of story. The trailers don't really do it justice as far as conveying what sort of story it is. It's a truly memorable film.A young boy, Pi, on his way to Canada with his family and their animals from their zoo, is shipwrecked and left stranded in the middle of the ocean on a boat with nothing but a Bengal Tiger to keep him company. But, unlike the Jungle Book, where you'd imagine the boy and the tiger become best friends and head off on an exciting adventure together, this story remains anchored in realism. This tiger is an actual tiger, which tends to want to maul and eat animals, including our protagonist, and there is a very effective scene early on that establishes this premise.The story becomes a tale of how the two manage to survive in close proximity with each other, each knowing the other wants to survive, and each knowing that, somehow, survival is dependent on the other. And as the final scenes start to show, the metaphor behind the scenario is deep and thought-provoking. Questions of religion, faith, humanity and the soul are raised, and you'll leave the cinema having experienced a pretty thought-provoking film.Suraj Sharma has to carry the film, as he and his CGI (for the most part) tiger are the only two characters on screen for most of the 2+ hours, echoing shades of Cast Away. And Sharma does a terrific job for a young and relatively unheard of actor. Ang Lee certainly brings out the best in his performance, and the effects on the tiger are sensational. You know he must be a CGI creation, simply for safety and practicality reasons, but you truly can't tell at times whether its one of the few scenes that has an actual tiger in it. It goes to show how far CGI has come.It's a visually stunning film, and its cinematography certainly adds to the story, rather than just provide a platform. Lee has always been good at using the surroundings to bring a story to life, and whilst sometimes, it maybe feels a little too pushed (the whale scene, whilst stunning, seems a little over the top), it's still wonderfully done. I didn't even find the 3D effects distracting.I would be surprised if this won any Oscars, simply cause it's maybe not the sort of film that would lead to any sort of wins, except maybe in the visual effects field, but its still certainly a terrific movie to take in. I suspect reading the book may give further meaning to the film's themes, but there are plenty there already to deal with.","

"xiaohuoontheroad","21 November 2012","It is very hard to give this masterful creation of Ang Lee a tangible rating and critic, because much of the takeaway of the film, is for the moviegoers and readers of the original novel to contemplate. It is also very hard to rate because it has been such a hard movie to make, out of a novel that addresses both the strength of faith and weakness of humanity in a rhetoric way.Ang Lee did it, although painstakingly. I was amazing by the soul of the film, thru the eyes of the Bengal tiger (amazingly) and the maiden acting of 17-year-old non-professional actor. The conversation about the journey of life that Ang Lee has succeeded in engaging us into is a special kind that few artists like him is able to deliver.The opening music is magic.The one point I deducted is my faith in Ang Lee. I will save that for his next film.Happy Thanksgiving, movie lovers.","

"jafar-iqbal","11 December 2012","A young writer travels to Canada to meet Pi (Irrfan Khan), an Indian man with an incredible story to tell. It is the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma), who gets stranded in the Pacific Ocean with only a fearsome Bengal tiger to keep him company. The two castaways form a strange bond as they try to stay alive and get help.That's the story of Life Of Pi, the novel written by Yann Martel back in 2001. For nearly ten years the international bestseller was deemed unfilmable, despite numerous attempts. It was only when Ang Lee took control that the movie became a reality, and it has finally hit the big screen.The result of Ang Lee's attempts is an epic piece of cinema. The film is absolutely brilliant, with just the right amount of humour, emotion and action to satisfy everyone. I've not read the book yet (I will, for sure), but I get the feeling that justice was done here in regards to the adaptation. Characters are properly fleshed out, major and minor, and relationships are developed well enough to matter as the film goes on. If anything could have been explored better, it would be the relationship between Pi and his mother (Tabu). The influence she has on his life seems understated, and not in a good way.Life Of Pi is very much a work of fiction; at no point are we led to believe that it is based on reality, and this works massively in the filmmakers' favour. Unlike Zemeckis' Castaway, which is rooted in the reality of it all, Lee opts to focus more on the fantastical and beautiful. There is no real sense of time, and we aren't always told how certain things happen. They just do, and the story moves along.There are two things that stand out about this movie, and one thing that lets it down sorely. The good first. Suraj Sharma, as Pi, is excellent. Considering he has no acting experience, he is a revelation. And secondly, the movie is visually stunning. Absolutely beautiful from first frame to last. It's a visceral treat.Now the bad. I watched the film in 3D, and thought many times: why is this in 3D? I counted literally two moments where the 3D worked well. Other than that, it was useless. If the money spent on 3D was spent on shooting it in IMAX, Life Of Pi could have been even better. Instead, it was a bit darker than it needed to be, and everyone sits in a cinema looking like Stevie Wonder for no reason.The good heavily outweighs the bad, though, and I highly recommend the movie. Like with Avatar, the movie should be seen for the visuals alone. Unlike Avatar though, this is actually a good film. You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll be engrossed with them, and you'll feel a genuine sense of rejoice as everything unravels. I can't tell you if the movie is better or worse than the book. I can tell you that that doesn't matter here: the movie is excellent all on it's own.","

"cpbottss","3 July 2013","Let me start this review by saying I have enjoyed many of Ang Lee's films in the past. Let me also say that I am an animal lover. And as an animal lover I am appalled that this movie got made. Now I am fully aware that a significant portion of the animal scenes were cg. Nonetheless, the extent of distress that the animals suffered in the actual scenes that were used on top of a blue screen amounted to nothing less than gross levels of animal cruelty and so typical of a person completely indifferent of modern day animal issues. For that Ang Lee should be ashamed of himself. Bottom line, I can't say strong enough that this is NOT a story that should have been put on film!!!I say that for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that the start of the film was culturally inaccurate. The mere suggestion that an Indian boy could freely and happily explore Hinduism, Islam and Christianity is nothing short of ludicrous and extends way beyond the scope of being able to 'suspend disbelief'. As for the cg, again, I felt is was ordinary at best and certainly not worth all the Oscar buzz it achieved. Don't get me wrong, I got the bigger message. I just don't think the vehicle for it was suitable for film and I don't think it can be even mentioned in the same sentence as films like Avatar. I have not read the book and I'm sure it was a great book, but it should have stayed a best selling novel. As for the film; it is used toilet paper and for his complicity in gross acts of animal cruelty, I hope Ang Lee never works again.","

"amit_imt2002","8 January 2013","Pi Patel is the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry,India and when the business fails they decide to move to Canada and sell the animals off.The family sets off on a Japanese ship with all the animals on board, much like Noah's ark,only this time the biblical floods have been replaced by Indira Gandhi's emergency.But that does not make it a political film! There is a perfect storm at sea and Pi somehow finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.The smaller animals fall victim to the food chain and Pi is left alone with the tiger.We are now faced with a simple question, are there two animals on the boat or one human and one animal? This is one of the pillars of our belief system.If we believe the we humans are in a league of our own and above all other animals we fall roughly into the camp of those who also believe in intelligent design and therefore puts us immediately at loggerheads with environmental issues.To accept Darwinian evolution and mix it with spirituality is one of the key challenges and part of the bigger question of reconciling science and religion in a post industrialized world.Children are born atheists and amoral.They acquire morality and faith or a combination of both as the result of a variety of factors driven primarily by parents.My 5 year old daughter is drawn to the creamy layer of Hindu Gods( out of the teeming masses of no less than 33 million) when she listens to stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. At school they pray to a secular God everyday.Yet she lives happily in an atheist household.What her beliefs will be I do not know, I merely intent to give her the gift of choice, while gently reinforcing my rationalist standpoint which I regard as my moral duty, just as my parents felt it was theirs to imbibe in me the fear of God.The key question of why Pi was drawn to religion remains open. He ends up a professor of theology.The 200+ day ordeal can change anybody profoundly.The trapped Chilean miners contemplated resorting to cannibalism to survive.Danny Boyles 27 Hours is another true example of the triumph of the human spirit when the protagonist amputates his own arm to survive. So the fictional story of a boy who survived impossible odds should not make us religious. The film is shot magnificently, its a superlative act of visualization to bring this story to the screen and Ang Lee certainly has that gift. Intriguingly, the way he handles the Indian angle of the film and the prelude to the fateful voyage reminds me of Mira Nair's work in The Namesake which was a lesser film but filled with some of the same elements, a boy who grows up with an improbable and embarrassing name, the presence of Irrfan Khan and Tabu and the challenges of an immigrant family in the alien landscape of America as a nuanced adventure, thematically similar to Pi stranded with a tiger in the vast oceans.There is a scene at the end of the film where Pi parts ways with his feline companion.Richard Parker does not look back at Pi to bid him farewell and walks away unemotionally while Pi sobs with heartbreak.The tiger and its fear kept Pi alive, which is an interesting counterintuitive logic where fear keeps us alive.Perhaps an emotional void is mans biggest enemy. As he recounts the story many years later his eyes well up with tears again.We are supposed to feel that humans have a monopoly over emotions and this sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, which is factually incorrect. Richard Parker deserves to be cut some slack as he has just survived an equal or probably even greater ordeal at sea!Mention must be made of Suraj Sharma who went to the audition to accompany his brother but landed the role out of 3000 aspirants.He does an outstanding job as a gangly youth who fights his circumstances with remarkable ingenuity and pluck.But the star of this visual feast must surely be the CGI tiger who looks us in the eye and brings to mind William Blakes classic poem The Tyger( a wonderful way to spell,sadly rectified in our school anthology) from his collection Songs of Experience, which was a sister poem of The Lamb.Pi is the Lamb here.When the Royal Bengal Tiger walks into the pages of history he will not look back with emotion at us humans who proved to be his worst enemies.We will be left wiping away our tears at having lost the most beautiful creature ever to our greed, indifference and arrogance. William Blake's poem brought to life by Ang Lee in the Life of Pi will hopefully survive for our children to fire their imagination.","

"italo505","26 November 2012","Lately I've been going to be movies with the uncertainty of finding a good movie, a movie that is not a complete bore, one that doesn't lack of a decent script or one without way too many special effects that overshadows the performance or the story itself. Rarely do I come out of the movie theatre with a smile on my face after having the good fortune of picking the perfect movie. Thus is the case with Life of Pi.Many times we see miracles in our every move, in every day and we choose not to see them, we're blinded by a blindfold that we put on ourselves and we question everything that we hear, everything we see. We need an open mind to the wonderful miracle of just being alive and that's what I got from watching Life of Pi. God closes a door but He always opens up a window. Or throws you a lifeboat that happens to have a Bengal tiger inside.","

"anupviswanath","25 February 2013","First of all great team work. Made me awe and jealous in a good way. The movie is so true to all elements about India and narrative way was too great, nobody can claim to have made this movie better or best because this is the best of the best. I haven't read the book but the movie has provided me a visual as well as audio treat. Visual treat I don't have to mention(it's known to all who watched this fabulous visual movie) now by audio I meant the score the start itself had traditional Indian music inch by inch but with a new pleasant and at the same time modern in instruments without just using it here and there. The team(visual,sound,actors,directors etc) have provided a new and more spectacular fantasy and dream like movie where in all elements of Hinduism are treated without any mocking sequences. The movie made me think and what I think this movie has conveyed are 1. Life has a meaning and to completely understand it is really hard (Anandi first love but marries another woman) 2. Circle of life comes in where dominant species kills lesser dominant species for survival(hyena kills orangutan and zebra in turn hyena gets killed by Tiger) and man being most dominant is able to train all other animals with his will(Pi training Richard Parker). 3.God works in the most mysterious ways 4.Never give up hope even when the shadows of lose is high. And the final sequence where the tiger just goes into jungle without turning back even though I didn't expect or didn't want it to happen but added meaning to what his father claimed. This movie is worth being called Indian movie because it brings in all our tradition,beliefs,ideas and myths into screen without losing its charm. I congratulate Ang Lee for Visualizing India in the most positive and effective way,each frame showing India was superbly taken and I wish more movies comes out which brings in the values of our nation rather than over hyped and very typical movie like Slum dog millionaire which I hate. And finally I found the ending as somewhat like Inception's ending where the viewer has to determine whether there truly was a Tiger(at the end Tiger goes into jungle and the screen becomes black and white) or just fragments of his imagination to do away with the loneliness or Is he paranoid?Some scenes made me think him as insane(1.When storm comes he pulls away the shelter type clothing and reveal Parker to the extreme weather condtions when he is tied to the boat). Anyway it's upto you viewers to believe in 'GOD' version or 2nd version. I believe in the more colorful story that is 'GOD' version rather than dull boring 2nd story without any color.","

"valadas","30 December 2012","Chiefly those at the sea including the stormy ones. It's actually a very well filmed movie from the technical point of view. The story is deep enough I mean the story of the boy in a boat with a tiger for 22 days after the shipwreck of the boat where both were travelling. Because as we see at the end this was only one of the two possible stories since the boy after having reached Mexico and been admitted to a hospital tells the representatives of the Japanese company that owned the ship a quite different story (although dramatic as well) after they told him they didn't believe in the first one. This feature of the plot enhances the quality of the film. Which one was true? We'll never know but both are very rich in their dramatic contents. The visual special effects are splendid and fortunately most of them were made by computer work since a few acts of cruelty against living animals (or presented as such) would have been to blame. Not exactly a very good movie but good enough and worth to be seen.","

"eyecandyforu","25 November 2012","Life of Pi is an amazing allegory, that attempts to explain a very abstract concept. This will no doubt confuse many, because it touches on the heart of how we perceive our own spiritual beliefs, it challenges our ideas of religion, the things we have held onto since childhood to give us hope and inspiration. Many people will leave the theater thrilled by a story of a boy who is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger and how they formed a bond that saved them both. The film is vividly colorful, exciting and haunting, masterfully directed by Ang Lee. But, just as we think we've had a rollicking good time with a fantastical story, the last part of the film comes at us, and shakes us up. This is the crucial part of the film, and if audiences choose to ignore this, they miss the entire message of the film. As Jung said ""Man must have his myths"". So it is with God, so it is with Life of Pi.","

The cinema is the telling of a story through images and sounds and this film does all this, and more, in a very beautiful, artistic and touching way.The visuals are breathtaking. From the opening scene (the zoo), a swimming pool, even a shipwreck, to the images of the ocean, the fauna and the sky. Every frame is a beautiful picture. The colors are bright and perfectly blended. The little boat just floating in the immensity of the ocean where you can't tell where the water ends and the sky begins will amaze you.The soundtrack is magnificent. It is very touching, it sets the moods very well, and the Indian sounds suit everything wonderfully.The story is moving to the core. Everyone who has lost something or someone dear will be moved to tears. Everyone who has ever said a definite ""goodbye"" will walk out the cinema with a knot in their throats. Whether you have faith, whether you believe in God, in some power, or whether you don't, you will be looking inside yourself, wondering, reflecting.What do we have when we've lost everything? Is there a higher power? Do animals have souls? Are we any different from them? Which story do you prefer?","

"bob-rutzel-1","18 March 2013","When the Narrator of the story is in the title, you can be sure the Narrator will not die. Pi (Suraj Sharma) is the Narrator. He and his family are on their way to Canada to sell their family zoo. A storm comes up and wrecks the ship and the only survivors are: Pi, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger (so named Richard Parker due to a cargo manifest order mix-up when the family bought him). Peter Parker was already taken. HA! After the Tiger eats the other animals, Pi decides he needs to teach the Tiger to fish or he will be eaten too. Wait, that's not right. What to do? What to do? Well, there is only one solution left and Pi hopes Richard Parker has enough intelligence to catch on. Now, getting the heavy stuff out of the way, there are 2-stories in here and which will you believe? The mystical one: a tiger and boy on a life boat; or a more believable one where Pi's mother, a seaman, and cook are in the life boat with Pi? Much of this has to do with a belief in God or having faith as the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) unfolds the story to a writer who was told he would believe in God when he heard Pi's story. Okay, good choice. You selected the boy and the tiger. Once they are in the boat together, there is nothing but tension, wariness, anger, fear and really too much suspense. But this never drags. It is like you are Pi and watching out for the tiger every minute of the day and night; and you don't dare rest – and even though we are watching from a comfortable couch, we cannot rest either. We are riveted as is Pi. Yes, there is much CGI in here but everything is so well done, we are still afraid to sleep. We see Pi put together a make-shift raft away from the boat attached with a tether. Now Pi is able to get some restand we try too. We see storms with very high waves, lightning, sharks, whales, flying fish come upon Pi and the tiger and even though Pi, as a very young boy, experimented with Catholicism (even asked to be baptized), and Islam it was the Hindu god Vishnu who he thanked for saving them time and time again. Hey, you go with what you know.The cinematography and photography are simply outstanding. Did you go with what you know when you selected your choice as I asked above? Do you know why the Tiger didn't look back at Pi when they landed on the sand? When you know the answer to that, you then know which story was the true one. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Cinematography, editing, visual effects (one of the finest uses of 3D technology I've ever seen), sound, music, script, direction and superlative acting (Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan both deserve Oscar nominations for their extraordinary performances) - this film is a must see! The tiger is ferocious, not a Disney cute and cuddly animal, but a real and frightening animal. I was gripped by this film for it's entire 2 hours and 5 minutes. Please see this movie on a large screen in a theatre; it is so worth it! (: This film is a hundred times better than ""Lincoln"" a million times better than the worst film of the year (""Zero Dark Thirty"", one of the worst movies ever made in cinema history). A+. This film should be nominated in every possible category, and I would especially like to see Mr. Sharma and Mr. Khan get richly deserved nominations (way better performances than the over-praised Daniel Day-Lewis, Alan Arkin, Bradley Cooper, Tommy Lee Jones - just my opinion, of course!)

"braddugg","24 November 2012","A silly dumb adventure that sails on sea for most part and left me with seasickness.At the end of the movie, I was hearing claps in the theatre and I was wondering what have they liked so much in the film because I did not like anything. Yes, the visual effects were good, but nowhere near a movie like JURASSIC PARK. Don't even compare with AVATAR please. The plot, oh, where is the plot, a boy gets lost in a sea because of a thunderstorm and he takes a trip with a tiger and for the good part of it, both are struck together in sea. The episode was too long for me and just made me feel like it's giving me seasickness. Now, where did it go wrong? If I may say so, then in the writing itself that does not involve audience much. That is, it did not do anything to me. It neither thrilled me nor moved me nor made me laugh out loud. It went on and on and got me drowsy by the end. The only good thing is special effects that are good, but I am sure many movies in recent past have come with better effects and better ideas. Hailed by many as one of the best films of this year, I would rather say, it's a boring adventure. It is good for the first half hour or even an hour I would say, but after that it goes on and on and the sad part is it has inevitable end. It's not a kind of movie that could have ended anyway, the adventure has to end and the boy has to grow and the big Pi (Irrfan Khan) is going to tell this to his friend. Hey, now there is a twist, he tells this adventure and he tells a believable story while normal people stick to his believable story, his writer friend likes the adventure. So I as audience, had to give in to something and I was rather interested in the story he told than this adventure. The best moments are done in the first half an hour itself with Pi and his family in Pondicherry, once he gets on a ship, and gets lost, it stays for sometime, but man, those jelly fish, those whales, even that royal Bengal tiger that was made in CGI did not help me liking it. So I disliked it to the core. Once, he said Richard Parker (Tiger) was gone at the end, I fell into sleep, I just couldn't take that. Damn, we had been there at the very night of a day (Night 11 PM show) and with all the pains taken, we see an adventure end just like that. It meant nothing for me, and I am going with a 1/5. This 1 rating is for the special effects and the gorgeous titles that were good but not great. Ang Lee, you squeezed me in to this film and you gave me a bad film so this is what I give you back, a negative review. I suppose I among the very few who are going to criticize this movie as most others are going gaga over this. It's okay; I have my own mind anyways.","

"Vincentiu","11 February 2013","or fairy tale. or only work of a great director. huge ambition. and magic result. it is perfect show. nothing more. the pure beauty of images seems be source for so many flavors. the crumbs from many films about survive in middle of ocean, the spiritual delicate veil, the young actor who does a memorable Pi, memories about pages of novel, the impression to discover definition of many feelings and events, the joy of details, the tiger and the boat as sign about Noah escape, all in a special light makes it a real art pillar of 2012. sure, special effects or 3 D are secret tricks for its success. but each remains color for a portrait. the hand of painter is same in every film. so, if you search a miracle, that is Ang Lee vision. and, more important, his extraordinary courage.","

"paulclaassen","18 June 2018","This highly acclaimed, multi award winning film was also a huge box office success, earning $609 million on a $120 million budget. Unfortunately I was not as impressed. The visuals and effects are indeed impeccable, but that's as much as I enjoyed about the film. The fact that Pi was telling the story and the actual story were flashbacks, removed every inch of suspense, as I knew nothing was going to happen to him. Why they chose to do it that way is beyond me. It also suffered from way too many plot flaws and was anything but credible. You honestly want me to believe the tiger was under the canvas of the raft for more than a day without making an appearance or even a sound?? And what was the purpose of the weird meerkat island? Nothing their made any sense and did not contribute to the story whatsoever, apart from adding to the already long running time. When Pi finally got to shore, the tiger just ran off!! I was expecting so much more, as Pi tried gaining the tiger's trust all along, and it seemed to work, until they reached the shore. Idiotic tiger! At the end, you still don't know if everything he told actually happened or whether it was just a figment of his imagination. I'll go with the latter.","

"ketgup83","20 February 2013","Life of Pi was one of the most enthralling and visually stunning film that had brilliant story-line , powerful performances with decent screenplay.Pi (Suraj Sharma) is left alone on a life boat after his ship wrecks only to be in the company of a Bengal Tiger , a hyena , a Zebra and an orangutan. He must fight for survival in this adventurous and epic journey which makes him realize the ultimate purpose of life.Oscar winner director Ang Lee has taken one step ahead and done a fantastic job to adapt a novel and turn it into a beautiful movie. The movie is engrossing right from the beginning and certain scenes will keep you on the edge of seat. The brilliant portrayal of chemistry between the tiger and PI is the highlight of the film. You will feel that a man and a beast can be a good friends but ultimately the question might that can we make animal our best friend ? The movie begins with PI telling the story about his adventures in the flashback. The childhood of PI where he begins to believe in different religion , his search for truth and his journey from India to the ship has been executed brilliantly. The moment Pi encounters the ship-wreck and left alone on a life boat with wild animal , the movie takes a complete U-turn and depicts the relationship between tiger and Pi brilliantly. Soon , they develop a special bond which eventually breaks in the end. It is at this place where I felt the emotion content is missing and sympathetic feeling is mixed where Irrfan Khan expresses his concern for not receiving proper goodbye from the tiger. I felt this movie was great but not spectacular which would want me to see it again and again. However , screenplay is crispy keeping you entertained , art direction is heavenly , cinematography is awesome capturing the gorgeous locations and images , visual effects are the highlight of the film and is award-worthy. Suraj Sharma does a superb job as a newcomer. Irrfan Khan gives his best. Tabu is good.Overall , very nice film which was visually enthralling and asks a lot of questions to the audience. It is up to us to decide the answer. Good 3.5/5","

"febru3012","2 May 2013","Taking big risks with big payoffs in directing, writing, production and casting were reasons enough for this movie to have won the Oscar for best movie. The story is tight and keeps you focused as no other movie I've seen in years. This movie breaks ground as it doesn't reprocess any story lines like there were in other movies that were in Oscar contention. Because this movie is unique I have to admit it took me a good half hour to get into the swing of what was going on. That is good since this movie takes you places you've never been and completely entertains you while doing so. This is what original movie making is all about. This is a must see movie.","

"dbogosian-1","24 November 2012","Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.But regardless, this movie redefines the word ""beautiful."" I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.","

"listofnames","6 January 2013","I'm afraid I must have missed something about this film. And perhaps I really did but there is nothing particularly awe inspiring as you might have been led to believe. For one the grand claim about making you believe in God is never really answered. There is a quick vague nod to it at the end but for me it made no sense. The main story has nothing whatsoever to do with God. So I'm a bit puzzled on that one. There is a bit of a semi twist near the end that I didn't see coming. This reveals an extra dimension to the story that was previously hidden to us. However the impact of the twist is never really brought home in any tangible way (that is quite possibly intentional). You would have to watch the film again to appreciate the twist but like me you will probably not be bothered. The best thing about the film is the cinematography, visual effects, pi himself, young and old (both characters and both actors)and the various animals. They are sometimes cute and have their own personalities. If you like nature programmes you will enjoy it. The 3D was never spectacular but a nice extra. There are a few gorgeous looking tableau like scenes of the boat on the sea with the skyline. Visually the film looks good throughout. Pi (younger)is an interesting character. He is intelligent and has a hunger for learning. His strange obsession with gods and religions is quite annoying though (especially for an atheist like me)and seems to serves no purpose for the narrative. I think the film might be trying to say something quite profound about religion but I'm afraid it was either made too subtly or just isn't there at all. Maybe you need to read the book. The actor of the older pi is quite brilliant and very engaging. Very stoic and dignified. All in all not a bad film but please don't believe the hype! Its a sad story really but the way it ends left me kind of cold and underwhelmed.","

"Hellmant","27 November 2012","'LIFE OF PI': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Director Ang Lee's adaptation of the popular 2001 book (of the same name) by Yann Martel about a boy who survives a shipwreck only to be trapped on a boat in the Pacific Ocean with a deadly Bengal tiger. The screenplay was written by David Magee (who also wrote the script adaptation for the 2004 film 'FINDING NEVERLAND') and stars Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan in the title role (at two different stages of his life). The film is presented in 3D and packed with visual effects (for the telling of what was said to be an 'unfilmable' book). I found the film to be visually stunning but slow in places. It does build to a satisfactory conclusion though, about spirituality and how we all view the world.The film tells the story of Pi Patel (played by Sharma at age 17 and Khan when he's an adult in his 50s), who was named 'Piscine Molitor' by his parents (after a swimming pool in France). He changed his name to Pi in secondary school after growing tired of constantly being mocked for his name by fellow classmates. He was raised Hindu but also takes up Catholicism and Islam at age 12. His family owns a zoo but decides to sell the animals and move to Canada due to political problems arising in India. A storm causes the ship to sink and Pi is the only one who makes it on to a lifeboat, except for four other animals (a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a orangutan and a Bengal tiger). The hyena quickly feeds on the other animals before being killed by the tiger. Pi must then find a way to live on the boat with the deadly tiger (without being eaten by it). He tells this story to a reporter (Rafe Spall) when he's married with children and in his 50's.Of course Pi's religious teachings come in to play while struggling to survive on the ocean. That's what the film is really about and it plays a part in a twist ending as well. What the film says about religion (in the end) might offend some viewers while enlightening others. I liked the overall message of the film. It's definitely a little slow at times due to the fact it primarily takes place on the ocean with one human castaway and a tiger. In that way the film is a little like Robert Zemeckis's 2000 film 'CAST AWAY' as well. Visually it's stunning and probably worth the price to see it in 3D (unless you just don't care for 3D). Not my favorite Ang Lee film but it's definitely a decent fantasy adventure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-fGGKVWPc","

Why not 10s? Seriously, on exactly what level do you think this film fell short? The acting? The computer-generated animal effects? The script? I mean, really? Where did it fall short? I've been wracking my brain and see nothing but perfection here. There wasn't a minute I'd rewrite or reshoot. It's just a damn good movie and could stand as the gold standard in quite a few genres. I had a friend tell me he'd take off a point because there were too many flying fish. Maybe he's right. I hope that's the worst thing they could say about any film I wrote or directed or produced or shot or acted in. Too many flying fish. Go see it and be dazzled. If this doesn't earn full marks from you, I seriously pose the question: what would?","

"rjennica","22 November 2012","This movie took me by surprise. I thought it was just about a young boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive on a small boat. But it was much more than that, for it conjured up thoughts, spiritually, visually, and intellectually. The actors were amazing and so, the Director Ang Lee. If you do see it, try and catch the 3D showing featuring the largest BTX screen/ multi-channel surround sound. I'm positive it would still be satisfying without those perks, but you will enjoy it much, much, more because it brings you into the location physically. I almost got seasick watching it because the huge screen was so, all encompassing. This movie features an all-Indian cast with acting skills displayed beyond the norm. Everything was so natural, as if no script was ever written. Spontaneity abounded throughout the film. The only negative: the theater turned up the sound too loud.","

"taooftri","4 March 2013","This is by far the best Ang Lee's film, at least to me.I read a lot of comments about this film after watching it just yesterday. Many discussions revolve the topic on whether the animal or human version of the story is real. My view is that none of them is real.It is a film about faith. Both the animal and human versions are not real. The human version is made up. The animal version is a figment of Pi's imagination and the animals are merely metaphors. The four animals personify the 3 religions and logic that Pi has been exposed to in earlier life. This adventure allows him to find the religion that means the most to him (we all have our preferred gods). Logic - most likely represented by the orang utan - is not enough to help Pi tide through the ordeal at sea. Only the tiger - his chosen religion/faith - is able to last him the whole way. In effect, the boat is Pi, his heart; and the sea and storms are life itself. Through life, and experiencing life, Pi finds his god.What is the island? The green interwined roots of the mystic green trees most likely stand for the serpents of Vishnu and the shape of the island does remind one of Vishnu. The fact that the island gives and takes away life provides further proof that it is actually a metaphor for Vishnu.There are many other interpretations to this film but I think this is the beauty of Life of Pi. The human version of the story was made up for the two Japanese investigators and it is actually a sarcasm toward the conventional minds, which do not believe in faith and miracle but embrace only the logical.It is a film not to be missed.Bravo, Ang Lee and team!","

"billmanuel","24 April 2013","I need to forewarn that I went into this movie with high expectations due to the critical review from the industry and the public, and the expectations grew even more after Pi said his story would make his friend, (and by extension me) believe in God. The CGI landscapes, seascapes were beautiful, but the CGI people were not as they looked odd, almost demonic. Still, I was really intrigued now that Pi was claiming that his story would leave me no choice but believe in God, so I kept watching.The story unfolded and there were some exciting scenes, as exciting as can be for a boy and his cat at sea, but even some of the animal CG looked a bit fake. Once the carnivorous island sequence appeared, I knew Pi was disconnected from reality, that it was not merely a case of artistic license. The movie went downhill from here.I waited for the big reveal, the part that would force me to throw off the yoke of agnosticism, change my life forever and finally embrace a higher power. The big reveal, the entire story was an allegory at best, but more accurately a lie to make the truth easier and more profound than it actually was. My takeaway from Pi about believing in God and changing my life forever, God exists if you only pretend he exists and if you are going to pretend, you might as well pretend big and make the lie really grand, truth, honesty, objectivity and logic be damned. So, in that respect I guess I learned more about religion than I cared to.Even worse, the author seems to assume that the public is stupid. At the end when we find out which animal characters represented which human characters, the orangutan being Pi's mother, the zebra being the sailor, the cook being the hyena, Pi's dimwitted friend asks,""but who is the tiger?"" Really? Come on. Pi is like a magical miracle potion that everyone is raving about, but when you actually invest in it and buy it for yourself, you notice the label on the back that says, ""Contents: Oil of Snake"".","

"dfle3","15 January 2013","I can't say that I was very excited to see this movie but I thought I'd give it a shot and found it very rewarding. In fact, it has repeat viewing value, given the ending. What surprised me most, perhaps, was the wit and humour in the dialogue. Not having read the book on which it was based, I have nothing else to compare it to, and found the story worked well as a spectacle...of which there are many.Without giving too much away, the story concerns the life and adventures of Pi Patel. We see him as a small boy and as an adult recounting the adventure most of us would be familiar with via the commercials for this film...himself as a teenager (played well by Suraj Sharma) adrift at sea, with a wild tiger as both a constant threat to him yet a constant but uneasy companion. Most of the movie is set at sea and here the cinematography (which I saw in 3D) is absolutely magnificent. You really do feel a sense of the infinite as Pi drifts endlessly on an endless ocean. Even some of the urban settings in Pi's childhood do have a wonderful picture postcard quality to them.Another contender for most surprising aspect to this movie was the theme of religion. I just did not expect this to be part of this movie, for whatever reason. In a way the movie is about religion. Or stories. A story about stories, in other words. Some professional reviews do mention the issue of how to interpret the movie. Maybe it is a parable? Could it be like a dream, requiring Freud to make sense of it? In these interpretative strategies there is the problem of mapping one thing from the sea adventure to some other thing from Pi's ordinary life. And doing that to account for everything. The desire to do so is powerful but the adult Pi does comment near the end of the movie about the merits of this procedure.Some professional reviews I've seen criticise the narrative device of having an adult Pi interviewed by a writer. Since I don't know whether this was in the book or not, I can say that it wasn't so much of an issue for me. There was a concern before I saw this movie that it might come across like one of Kamahl's commercials for a certain brand of tea, but it worked well for me. The writer (played by Rafe Spall) functions as an 'everyman' asking the kind of questions the curious audience might want to ask. Being a literal minded person, I did really appreciate the writer's attempt to interpret Pi's sea adventure...it is that titbit of information which gives the movie repeat viewing value...I had expected to give this movie 80%, but it's this potential repeat viewing value which bumps my score up to 85+%.Special mention should be given to the special effects in this movie. It's great. Having this volatile mix of carnivores and herbivores on Pi's boat interact with each other in a believable way was admirably achieved. At times the tiger seemed to be a CGI creation, but maybe I was wrong on that? It's very rare that you think these special effects don't feel quite right.It was a surprise to me to see so many young children watching this movie at the cinema. Appropriately, perhaps, the animal life cycle was sanitised on the boat...there is no great gore to speak of, but there are some dark themes verbalised at the end of the movie, which makes me wonder how suitable it is for children. But that darkness houses felt pain, which was another rewarding aspect to this film. It has great humanity.Whilst a movie like ""Seven psychopaths"" is my pick as the most entertaining movie for the year, I don't think I would be allowed to pick that as my choice for best movie. ""Life of Pi"" seems a more intellectual choice to make and I do feel that an award for the best movie of the year would be well deserved, along with awards for cinematography. Ang Lee deserves a nomination for direction too. Suraj Sharma is also worthy of a nomination. This movie is a wonderful spectacle but the tale has hidden depth to it, which makes it ripe for revisiting and seeing it anew. Which viewing would explain the meaning of the movie best? That is the question. When Pi's father states his preference for the scientific story of life, I do wonder whether the movie agrees with him or not...or if there is truth in any story...just preferences for one story over another. Was the other story Pi told the writer true?","

"Chrysanthepop","3 March 2013","Finally 'got to watch Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' based on Yann Martel's classic novel. This is perhaps one of the few films that pays attention to detail in order to be as true to the book as possible. Of course filmmakers take cinematic liberty and there's nothing wrong with that as long as the final result matches up at least to what the book accomplishes (which isn't the case with most Hollywood adaptations). 'Life of Pi' is perhaps as accurate a film can be to its original. Now we come to Ang Lee and his art team's fantastic imaginative visualization. It's all about the details. While the CGI images look terrific, I also loved how the live images were captured, especially the colours of India. A majority of the film takes place at sea but even there colour plays a significant part. The detailed CGI designing of the animals especially the characters on the boat is impressive.Newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sincere performance. Irrfan Khan and Adil Hussian are great. Tabu is terrific in a small role. The child actors are very good too.For those who haven't read the book (read it if you haven't) and those who have, while 'Life of Pi' is a beautiful story of survival, in the end it's more about how imagination and how that alone can keep one alive when all else is lost.","

"dsa_ca","9 December 2012","I love coming of age movies. They have been my go to movies for over a decade. A real world experience that molds a person's character for rest of his/her life is a universal subject that would never dry up. But then there is this book called 'Life of Pi' that I came across and provided more than my staple coming of age diet and take me through a journey of faith and beliefs. This book acts as a disguise to be spiritual (given that is set in India), but at the core is a coming of age story of a boy finding answers of faith and beyond having born in a nation of millions of gods. And to turn this book into a captivating movie, we have Mr. Ang Lee; who clearly love challenges.Set in India and made by Hollywood studio; you should expect the simplistic description of a very complex nation and its affair with religions of the world. But Mr. Lee manages to breeze through the shallow storyline based in India. Almost all of the situations and scenarios about young boy Pi's life in Pondicherry, India are created to suit the taste buds of western audiences. As we watch the young Pi grow in dreamy India along with a soulfully spoken narrative by Irfan Khan in background; we instantly are lost in the color and the mood of the film. We never look beyond those colors into reality and we are ready to accept anything. But as we move on from Anglo India into open sea; faith and personal beliefs of Pi collides with nature's fury. After Pi Patel's father, a zoo owner decides to move his family in Canada and sell the animals to a North American zoo for a good prize; they begin their journey. The entire family along with all the animals travels through a Japanese cargo ship across the oceans. There they have encounter with a borderline racist French cook and a very gentle Buddhist. There reel time is only for one sequence, but there presence and importance will be felt late in the movie. As the journey of the ship abruptly ends in a very violent ocean; Pi is survived on a life boat with an injured zebra, an Orangutan, a Hyena and a Bengal Tiger. And from here on the journey could not be more breath taking and satisfying. It literally and astonishingly unbelievable with Pi surviving on a life boat with these animals and they are animals. They will do anything to survive like humans. The mystery of the journey and whether you believe in the memories of the adult Pi about his experiences across the vast ocean will make you rethink about all the mystical fantasies that we have ever came across.The story already hooks the audience into the ongoing proceedings and Mr. Lee's breathtaking visuals puts 'Avatar' in its place & carries you through a journey of vast beauty across our planet. After Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, Mr. Lee successfully trumps those monumental achievements in Cinema history with this visual masterpiece that deserves compulsory 3D viewing.For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/","

"bob the moo","8 June 2014","Life of Pi was one of those books that interested me and was constantly on my mind to read but, being quite a lazy man, I never actually got around to it. The story is one told to an American writer by a man called Pi Patel and it involves a ship wreck where the only survivors are himself and some animals which were also being transported on the ship – the most notable of which is a tiger called Richard Parker. Pi relates his struggle to survive, the things that happened to him and ultimately seeks to make the writer believe in god.Although there is an establishing period early in the film where we discuss god and then also see young Pi and his various religions, the majority of the film occurs once at sea and for most people this is the film they came to see. The posters, the awards and so on all point to this film as a spectacle and to be fair it is. Throughout all the animal sequences it is pretty much never unconvincing; the animals look real and look like they are right there in the same scene. Where bigger sequences occur they are also impressive and technically the whole film looks great. I saw it on 2D on only a television rather than the cinema, but it still worked apart from bits of personal preference – I never like those 1950's style scenes of 'poking audience with stick' – they seem in service of technology than story. Anyway, technically the film works.The problem is that it works too well. It becomes so much about spectacle that we forget all the work in the early part of the film – all that talk about god and ultimately Pi's statement that he will make the writer believe in god. This comes back at the end in a way that is actually quite satisfying because although not as smart as it thinks it is, it does make you think even if it is pretty bleak. The thing is though that this seems stuck on to a special-effects movie, not that a movie about religion had effects in it; so the irony is that the substance of the film really doesn't work as well as it could have done. The need to make the spectacle also means that the film runs much longer than it needed to do if you really were focused on telling the story.It is still a well made project though and the work of all involved is really up there. From the cast, Sharma is great in his first film – convincing in the emotional and physical sides. He is well represented by the older version of his character by Khan (although I did keep hearing his In Treatment character in his slow tone). There are other good performances in here but generally the film is all about Sharma and it is impressive that he isn't lost in the special effects or scale of the scenes. Life of Pi is a film that works best as something that it is not – a big, technically impressive, spectacle. The downside of doing that so well is that it is runs longer than the narrative actually needs and makes it feel like the substance is the thing that is a bit out of place in the film.","

"riziger","28 February 2013","Life of Pi is a story about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck with a Bengal tiger. If that doesn't perk your interest, I'm not too sure what will. This film is a proper adventure story with storytelling that takes you on a journey in a way that I've not experienced in awhile. And boy how it has been translated to visual form is breathtaking. No surprises at all at the cinematography, directing and visual Oscars it's won with the best animation I have ever seen. I can honestly say that in almost no scene was any animation apparent and that just immersed me more into the adventure.Suraj Sharma does a brilliant job as the shipwrecked Pi, and Irrfan Khan plays an understated but equally charming adult Pi. The tiger, Richard Parker, forms a bond with the viewer that creeps up on you, and by the end I was hoping for it's survival as much as for Pi's. For something that spends the majority of the film as an animation, I thought that was fantastic. Perhaps the only con is the religion angle that some may not appreciate. However, I found it was just a facet of the plot and I had no problems with it.I'm going to put myself on the chopping block and say this is one of the most complete films I've seen in a long time. Charming plot, perfectly cast, with a big enough budget to bring it to life visually. I will also say, that I believe this deserved the best picture Oscar. A must watch.","

"MovieFanBenLinus8","27 February 2013","Life of Pi is an absolutely outstanding philosophical film, undoubtedly one of the best to come out last year. It recently won four Academy Awards, all of which were absolutely deserved; it is impeccably crafted and deeply moving. The first time I saw the film, the framing narrative structure disoriented me, due in large part to the deliberate pacing. After watching the movie again, however, everything clicked for me, and now I can say that there is hardly a false note among the storytelling. As an adult, the title character reflects back on his life, how it all changed him, and more importantly, how he still feels about it. We first meet the younger Pi in his school days, and we witness him acquire valuable skills from his family that will ultimately prove highly beneficial in his life, despite the fact that he takes much of it for granted. He also manages to create a new identity for himself, by taking the nickname of ""Pi"" and displaying his knowledge with the irrational number. This ties into much of Pi's overall philosophy; reality hardly matters. What's more exciting and engaging for him and his life is the overall better story. He is first and foremost a storyteller, and he is absolutely one who uses his power wisely. And so it is no wonder that he becomes so intrigued by three various, almost contradictory, religions. He deeply loves the sense of community he gains from them, and he deeply relishes in his faith. Starting with the stunning shipwreck sequence, however, he comes to realize that his faith must continuously be tested in order to be fully pure. And there is surely no stronger test of faith than being stuck in a lifeboat with nothing but an adult Bengal tiger. As time goes on, however, he manages to survive, all the while learning to appreciate the gift of life with what little time he has, and to realize that suffering is a necessity for true happiness. Much debate has been brought about by the film's ending; people wonder ""did it really even happen""? I personally find the ending extremely powerful, one that enforces the movie's thesis. It hardly matters what really happened at sea in the lifeboat; the only important thing is which story is better. And the jaw-dropping special effects only add to the excitement of the story; this is truly a larger than life experience. Even the use of 3-D is spectacular, as it fully immerses us in Pi's world. This is a technically flawless film, and it begs the question, ""was Avatar ever this visually stunning?"" I'd say no. Life of Pi is unquestionably one of the year's best films, and it is more than a film. It is an experience; both a visual one, a philosophical one, and a storytelling one. This film absolutely must be seen; it is an absolute stunner and a near-masterpiece. Overall Rating: 10/10- ""My Highest Recommendation.""","

"martinrobertson300482","20 March 2013","I Was in two minds about ""Life of Pi,"" but hearing its high praise from others made me curious enough too see it.I Can still see it as something people will either take or leave though. Its about an Indian boy who gets trapped on a boat with a tiger, so seems like a random idea to begin with. Or is it an original idea? Either way, its both so visually amazing, and beatifically weird, how the film makes a full length feature out off such a bizarre subject, that its hard to ignore. Making me understand where its Oscar nods are coming from.It does get a bit too weird later on though, and despite having some laughs, it can hardly be described as a comedy. In fact its hard to figure out what ""Life of PI"" wants to be, but maybe that's part off what makes it so new and unique. Its special effects are what got it noticed, and they are very good, even though that damn tiger does seem to change size throughout the movie. Something the animators still seem too have trouble getting right, even these days.","

"hani_78696","30 March 2013","Perfect Storytelling and great adaption of a novel which was considered unfilmable before the movie. Ang lee really broke grounds,to the level of avatar. Most visually enriched movie of the year. The magic lies within Special Effects and Cinematography. Great narration by Irrfan Khan as well as Good acting by Suraj Sharma. Not only visually but emotionally satisfying,i broke into tears during the movie and tears of joy in the end. I loved the reference Pi makes about Tiger,Sailor and his Mother to himself ,Zebra and orangutan. It gives us moral ""Never to lose hope and Keep Trying,There will definitely a way out of all problems""","

"p-jonsson","17 May 2013","I did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.As I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with Gérard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended. We bought the movie because my youngest daughter loves movies about animals but not even she was overly entertained by this movie.","

"rivertam26","25 November 2012","Acclaimed director Ang Lee has taken the supposedly unfilmable book and turned it into an overlong, technically brilliant mixed bag. Centering on a young boy who finds himself stranded on a boat with a Bengal tiger after a ferocious storm sinks the ship he was on. There is about 40 minutes before leading up to those vents where we meet the main character and his family. I got the themes of truth vs. fiction, coming of age in the face of tragedy and the symbolism of an animalistic nature, but i can't say that I got anything to deep or profound from this film. And there are many reasons I believe I didn't but here let's start with the good. The movie is technically brilliant. The effects are truly sensational especially the animal design. it's truly captivating to say the least and the movie also has some inspired whimsical cinematography. Now for the not so good I found myself unimpressed with the films human performances especially the central one. It's not that he was bad but he failed to engage especially in the face of such incredible events it just didn't feel emotionally resonant and engaging like it should have and part of that lies in the direction which I'd like to say was solid for the most par. But here's the thing once you discover what this film is about it kind of is unfilmable. It's something that works much better on the page. Because as a film it just doesn't mesh well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone thinking of seeing it. but if you're expecting to be inspired and feel as though there is a strong profound message that will mirror something in your life, you're going to be disappointed. The film is just what it is and nothing more in my opinion at least. It moves along ploddingly and although it has genuine moments of cinematic inspiration it fails to really connect on a level that counts and after a while it all feels like you are the one barely surviving.","

"kevin_robbins","6 February 2023","Life of Pi (2012) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a family that owns a zoo in India that plans to bring the animals to the US, sell them, and start a new life. The ship sinks and one of the sons in the family successfully survives on a lifeboat with an unexpected companion.This movie is directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and stars Suraj Sharma (Happy Death Day 2U), Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire), Tabu (Missing) and Rafe Spall (The Ritual).The storyline for this picture is unique, compelling and really captures the imagination. The characters are easy to root for and the circumstances are unbelievable, sad and magical at the same time. Any scene with an animal in it is amazing. The opening lion cage scene with the goat is excellent. Every scene in the boat is tremendous and the ultimate twist in the storyline is awesome. There's a whale scene that's beautiful and an island scenes that's super cool.Overall, this is a magical picture that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.","

"pranav_2001","23 November 2012","We have always been told that value of Pi is best calculated as 22/7 but you wouldn't know that 355/113 give a more accurate value of Pi than 22/7. However, using 22/7 makes it easier for to do calculations and that's the reason why it is used often.Done with beating around the bush... time to criticize!From the time movie start you can't help but notice the ""beautiful"" picturization and cinematography throughout. Add to that the life-like sound affects make you experience the movie almost in real time. This movie shows the wrath of ocean on its survivors and its destructive powers. There have been several movies made about survivors in wild or islands or the sea. This movie makes the survival journey even harder by making the human survive on a small rescue boat with a Royal Bengal Tiger. In my opinion, the presentation of this movie on the big screen was flawless. Plot revealed below.But you can never have a good movie experience until the actors ""live the movie"" and convince their audience that it all happened for real. Pi's role is taken by two people, Suraj Sharma when he was younger and Irfan Khan, the older Pi who narrates his life experience to a novel writer. Both have acted very well for their roles, but the role of honest looking younger-Pi seemed to make older Pi's role look a little weaker. During Pi's struggle to survive on a small boat with the fierce tiger, he realises a lot of things, most of it is self realization, the way he loses hope and regains it and the mysterious things he sees in his voyage makes the fictional story intriguing. What I liked about the movie was how Pi starts enjoying the little things he was left with in the rescue boat and how important it becomes for him. But, the most interesting part of the movie is how the boy and tiger learn to survive together and realize that each of them played a big part in keeping them alive.What makes a movie more unrealistic is a big negative for me. I didn't like extra affects that make the ocean look beautifully clear and magical. Another flaw in the story is the way it starts and the way it ends seem to have no connection. In the beginning Pi, as a younger kid seems to be furiously looking see the meaning of life, religion and God. By the end of it, I would have expected that the story would come with a clearer answer. The story makers somehow didn't make the ends meet.My suggestion: Pi is a good movie to experience. Watching it in 3D makes the movie experience even better.","

"rgcustomer","27 November 2012","At the end of Life of Pi, the talented liar Pi asks the visiting Writer to choose between his two stories -- one a short brutal story of human cruelty and desperation, and the other a long romantic story of bonding with a dangerous animal. (Despite Pi's stated claims, gods actually don't play any part in the long story).Nobody proposes that the Writer (or audience) should reject both of Pi's stories, even though that's good advice.The Writer of course chooses the more detailed and uplifting romantic story. It saves him from having to come up with it himself. Presumably, this is the manner in which the Writer is convinced to ""believe in (some) god"" although that's never said directly. In any case, his goal is to sell books, not to seek truth. It's not hard to guess which story is going to sell, and real life is in the process of confirming it.But the audience eventually wants the truth. We're clearly to assume that one of the stories is true (within the context of the film). Pi insists both stories are possible, suggesting we can freely choose equally. But that's not quite correct. Probabilities must be weighed. I buy the tiger story, up to a point (although perhaps I shouldn't... remember the scorpion and frog story from The Crying Game: ""it's in my nature""). But for me, probability ends at the ""carnivorous island"". It's extremely unlikely that there would be an undetectable island literally covered with fish-eating meerkats, who act indifferently to being eaten themselves, as depicted in the film. I'm more likely to believe in a mentally ill, bigoted ship's cook who takes advantage of a crisis to torture and kill. There is plenty of reason to believe that story over the other. It happens all the time on land.Somewhere between the two probabilities, it's also possible that the liar Pi survived at sea alone, and didn't just make up one bold lie, but two. But that would be a dull story, and Pi is clearly not one to tolerate boredom and dullness.The Japanese men appeared to accept the brutal story, but we're never told whether they transmitted that story to others. What of the families of the men claimed to be on the lifeboat? This story would have been an outrage, with possible legal consequences.Pi's story, because he so easily bears false witness, is unmoving, and I wasn't made into a believer by watching this film. If anything, it all fits comfortably with my unbelief. The film concludes in such a way as to demonstrate that these fanciful and sometimes pretty stories are there to hide darker ones, or more boring ones, and also to cast those who doubt them as somehow being suspect of supporting bad outcomes. We know this is how religion works, but it's nice to see it spelled out so clearly on the big screen.As for the film itself, it's quite an achievement in animation mixed with live action, and 3D cinematography. I'll have to see what The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does with high-frame rate, but Life of Pi should certainly be up for some significant awards in that area. (Yet, truly James Cameron is still the undefeated master of sinking a ship, and creating marvels that glow in the darkness.) Last, I also just saw Kumaré, which I recommend as a good double-feature with this film.","

"roystephen-81252","13 February 2016","Ang Lee is a great filmmaker. From his early Taiwanese films like Eat Drink Man Woman to his later Hollywood productions like Brokeback Mountain, he has probably never made a bad film. (And with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon he created an unparallelled masterpiece in the history of cinema.)Pi does not disappoint, either. In fact, the beginning of the movie is a genuine surprise. I had to check it was really Ang Lee who directed the film, because it looked and felt exactly like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's work (whose unique visual and storytelling style I also happen to love). Later I learnt that it was actually Jeunet who was originally slated to direct Pi, and he had done a great deal of work on the film until he dropped out. Ang Lee emulates his style so successfully in the opening scenes that I am thoroughly convinced he could direct a true Jeunet movie any time.But he adds his own touch to the film, as well. As always, he elicits great performances from the cast, and fills the screen with haunting images. Like all of his movies, Pi is beautiful, meaningful, deeply moving and has that visceral, eye-opening, lump-in-the-throat moment at the end that an Ang Lee film never fails to deliver.","

"jmbwithcats","16 July 2014","OK so I just finished watching, and thought it was a profoundly beautiful movie that captures the way myths are created, and the truths they hide, and beautiful... so did the tiger exist? I think ultimately no, there was no tiger, no orangutans, no hyena, and no zebra, like he says there's the mundane story, the forms... of the sailor, the cook, his mother and himself... but that only tells the physical and emotional story... the spiritual story is told by the boy, the tiger, the orangutans, the hyena and the zebra.... one feels the profound love and loss as they are in the heart, and not just in the distant mediocrity of detached relationships... this elevates the film to great heights and depths... and I could not say I found it wanting in any way... How do you explain any love or loss? You can't just say it in words, you have to paint a picture... and that's what the boy and the tiger represented, an ability to be inspired and not destroyed by simple human pettiness.","

"lethalweapon","6 January 2013","The tale of Pi Patel, an Indian boy who grew up in a zoo in Pondicherry. The movie is shown as narrated to an author interested in penning his adventures. The main focus is on Pi's incredible journey from India, where he lost his parents and older brother in a violent storm. They were headed towards Canada to sell off their animals and start a new life, but a horrific storm wiped out the entire crew. Pi is stranded alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named 'Richard Parker'.The core of the story is how Pi manages to co-exist with Richard Parker in the harsh environment of the Pacific, with limited supplies, no help in sight, and unpredictable weather. The movie is an artistic delight. Fantastic visuals (The best use of 3D visuals since Avatar), amazing storytelling, good plot-line, and compelling camera-work. The narration was largely visual. With only one human survivor, the story couldn't be pulled through conversations. I expected a voice-over accompaniment throughout the movie, which would have been the easy way out. However, it went without the voice-over, like the 2000 movie Castaway - and this allowed the audience to drink in the vast emptiness and loneliness that perseveres through the movie.The story was interesting, but straightforward. This is possibly why the twist at the end of the story took me completely by surprise. I won't give out spoilers, but a subtle twist that leaves something ambiguous puts an entirely different shade to the whole experience. And that escalates the story from a good one to a truly excellent one.","

"sddavis63","2 July 2013","Having read and enjoyed the book, I approached this movie very cautiously, wondering how ti could possibly live up to the novel on which it's based. In truth, it didn't. Rarely does a movie based on a novel manage to do that. However, while it doesn't meet the standard of the novel, I have to give credit to Ang Lee and others who were involved in the production. ""Life of Pi"" (the novel) would have been a very difficult novel to adapt for the screen for a whole variety of reasons - but I think Lee and others did a commendable job of bringing the basic story to life.The film starts out relatively slowly, with an exploration of Pi's upbringing. Named ""Piscine Molitor Patel"" after a swimming pool in France, Piscine adopts the shortened form of ""Pi."" He's raised in India, spends much of his time observing the animals at the zoo owned by his family and embarks on a spiritual quest, raised as a Hindu, but also adopting Islam and Christianity, because he simply wants to love God. Then, his father decides to move to Canada, and while on the way the ship they're travelling on sinks and Pi finds himself the only human survivor, adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger named Richard Parker for companionship.The shipwreck and the voyage in the lifeboat is wonderfully portrayed, if a little bit (to say the least) unrealistic. Of course, when I say that I'm falling into the trap of the Japanese ship owners, who also can't accept that Pi's story can be real. This, of course, is the spiritual crux of the story: what, exactly, is reality? Are some stories too good to be true? Are some stories so good that they can only have come from God? It's an interesting spiritual exploration - not at all heavy handed, but often front and centre.The ocean voyage is basically a one man show, carried effectively by Suraj Sharma as Pi. The other characters, of course, are the animals in the lifeboat: Richard Parker the tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. The animals are animated, but incredibly realistic. The older Pi, who tells the story, is played by Irffan Khan, whose soft-spoken portrayal captures the essence of the character.It's a commendable adaptation of the novel. The opening scenes in India left me a bit dry to be honest, but the very powerful portrayal of the ocean voyage drew me back in completely. Overall, a pretty decent adaptation of the novel. (7/10)","

"The_Film_Cricket","25 November 2012","Oh! And what a life it is! What a visual masterwork that Ang Lee has brought to the screen. Here is a story brimming with excitement, adventure, poetry, and the strange whims of drifting destiny. Here is the story of one life, one extraordinary man and his adventure to find himself and his way back home. It is based on a best-seller by Yann Martel, but it reminds you of the kinds of stories by Rudyard Kipling. It's that good.Life of Pi tells the life story of an Indian boy named Pi (Suraj Sharma) whose father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, India. We meet him in a series of opening passages that have a tone all of their own. He was born with the name Piscine, a word which, when translated from French to English means ""swimming pool"", but his parents overlook how the word looks on paper and so everyone calls him by an unflattering euphemism for urination. He silences their mockery one day in the classroom by demonstrating his wizardry at mathematics by showing them the constant of 3.14. From this, he shortens his name to Pi. We follow his upbringing as he comes to questions the nature of religion, settling on theories of Muslims, Hindus and Christians, trying to get a grasp on his purpose in life. His mother wants him to explore, but his father wants him to be more practical and real. These are lessons he will take with him all through life.The zoo starts losing money, so Pi's father informs the family that they have to sell the zoo and move to Canada. They pack up their belongings and a few of the animals and board a Japanese freighter bound for their new home. Then one night a storm hits that is so ferocious that it could have come from the Bible. Pi falls into a 25-foot lifeboat and the freighter sinks. All on board are apparently killed but Pi finds himself briefly sharing the lifeboat with a zebra with a broken leg; a seasick orangutan; a hyena; and an ill-tempered Bengal tiger that turns the other animals into lunch (not to worry, it happens off-screen). Pi builds himself a raft out of oars and life-preservers and sits tethered to the boat until he can figure out how to deal with the tiger who has taken up residence in his boat.Much like Robert Zemekis' Cast Away much of this movie deals with one man's fight for survival. The two are similar in their observations of trying to deal with survival under limited conditions, but this one takes place almost completely at sea. Pi tries to keep himself hydrated with rainwater and freshwater that was stored aboard the lifeboat, and with the few rations that he has. He also tries to keep the tiger – named Richard Parker – nourished with fish that he catches with his bare hands. He knows that the beast will eventually get hungry enough to turn on him if he doesn't keep its belly full.The relationship with the tiger is not what we expect. Pi has several chances to let the beast drown or starve to death but he refuses. He admits, in his journal (which makes the excuse for voice-over narration), that the tiger is giving him instincts that he never felt before, like a new sense of alertness. What is so brilliant about the relationship is that Ang Lee never makes the mistake of making the tiger sentimental. This isn't one of those bond-with-animal movies from Disney. Lee never takes away the tiger's savage nature and that brings the story tension and a sense of grounded reality. A bond does form but it is more out of respect for the situation. Their final moments together are as real as they are touching.That reality is necessary because the film occasionally breaks away from the real world and allows us some moments that are surreal, like a visit to a living, breathing island that seems prepared to have Pi and Richard Parker for lunch. Visually the movie is breathtaking. There are shots here that are not just computer effects but are shown just to allow us some moments of pure beauty. One shot in particular takes place underwater as we are looking up at the boat with the sky behind it. There doesn't seem to be any water there and Pi seems to just be floating on air. The CG effects here are miraculous, especially in giving life to the tiger. He is a savage beast, yes, but eventually we see him as Pi sees him, and we come to like him without finding him cuddly. This is a movie that respects animals by not making the mistake of trying to humanize them.What happens in the film's final act is a question left to the viewer over the validity of what we have just seen. There are many questions to be raised about those moments and many that are difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. The ending will illicit many deep discussions afterwards.To watch Life of Pi is to observe how few films really consider their characters, how few consider the spiritual journey of the adventure they are undertaking. A lot of films are about journeys of violence or revenge but can hardly be bothered to deal with what the characters have learned. This movie is so much more than that.","

"brando647","5 July 2013","Once I watched this movie, it was impossible to shake from my mind for almost three days after. Each time I've watched it, it's left me in awe. LIFE OF PI is a beautiful film with a magnificent story to tell. From Ang Lee (director of HULKthe one with the gamma poodle yeah, I went there), LIFE OF PI is based on a novel from Yann Martel that, admittedly, I've never read. It is, without a doubt, one of the most (if not, THE most) visually stunning movie of 2013 and the story is one that just stirs around in your head, leaving you to think back on what you've watched and question everything about it. The premise of the story is what originally hooked my attention: a young Indian boy is adrift at sea, trapped aboard a life boat with a Bengal tiger. More specifically, the boy is Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and he was raised in India with his family in their zoo. When times become tough and the zoo must close, his family loads the animals aboard a freighter and they set off for Canada. A storm leaves Pi alone on the Pacific Ocean, a lone survivor from a shipwreck, with an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger along for the ride. LIFE OF PI is a tale of faith and survival that might, as an adult Pi describes as he recounts his tale to an interested author, ""make you believe in God."" Ultimate belief in a deity is not guaranteed, but an incredible story with mind-blowing effects is.So, for a little context from this commenter, I am not religious or spiritual in any real sense. You don't necessarily need to be in order to enjoy this movie. This is not a movie to preach religious faith or drive home points about how belief in God is important or whatever. This is one man's account of a life-changing event in his life and how (and more importantly why) it strengthened his belief in God. The character of Pi Patel is more than your average Hindu. He's Hindu, Christian, and Muslim with a possible bit of Jewish mixed in. He's a boy who loves God in all his forms and his faith will be put to the test over the course of this two-hour film as he is trapped in the middle of the largest ocean in a lifeboat with a tiger. As if survival isn't difficult enough when you're trapped thousands of miles from anywhere with limited food and clean water, but a hungry carnivorous cat tends to exacerbate problems. Pi will face hunger, weather, and his fellow passengers in his long quest across the ocean while maintaining his faith that his God (of many faces) is watching over him. And in the end, when Pi returns to society and gives us (and two Japanese insurance adjustors) a second version of his tale, we are introduced to a new understanding behind faith in a higher power and what leads people into it. As a firmly non-religious person, I actually thought it was one of the most enlightening descriptions of religious faith I've heard. And it's all done without being preachy.LIFE OF PI is, as you've probably heard just about any time the movie is discussed, an amazing visual feast. I don't like to use the term because I think it comes across as corny, but I'll make a rare exception for LIFE OF PI: it is stunning. Ang Lee, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and the visual effects team have created a gorgeous film. It's not often you see a movie of this caliber anymore. LIFE OF PI is a prime example of film as art, as opposed to summer blockbusters or cash-grab sequels. The visual effects in this movie are superb but you might not think so when watching it. It wasn't until after I'd seen the movie twice that I discover that the majority of scenes with Richard Parker, the tiger, are a CG animal. In fact, most of the animals in the film are CG. That blew my mind. Not once over the course of the movie did I question whether the animals I was watching were real. In a time when I can go to your average summer film and count the CG elements, it is great that there are movies that incorporate such subtlety that you might never question what you're watching.On a related note, I am one that would argue that the Academy Award LIFE OF PI won for cinematography was undeserved because so much of the movie was done as visual effects. As beautiful as this movie was, there were others in 2012 more deserving of the recognition for their work with physical lighting and camera-work.","

"chaos-rampant","13 February 2013","Films usually work upon the same mechanisms, it is what religion in old times simply used to warn against. In more typical dramas, the sin is acted out as some part of life, the more recognizable the better. This was fine for centuries, but the invention of the camera opened it up in great ways. More ambitious films visualize the experience or feeling as it arises, more or less vividly render the hell of it (think Lynch), usually with some the ambiguity and mystery it happens in real life.This is midway between the two ways.Framed with religion and the search for answers, the story here is of a young boy on a spiritual journey with his animal self. The boy has previously adopted religion, several in fact, and this deeper perspective he cultivates is the film we see. On a simple level, it is a story of survival, but so extraordinary that you know there's more to it, hidden depths. Visualized around him, we have a series of meditations inspired by the elements—in tempestuous seas, in the whale magnificent to behold but wrecks everything, in the magical, by day, inter- connected nature of the island but turns deadly by night.Visually, the experience has been more evocatively done in Tropical Malady, which is on the same journey to inner self (once more a tiger) and clarity. Greenaway has more puzzling symmetries. But it's a nice film to have, perhaps too clean and cutesy, but clean for a reason.Here's the caveat. The idea so simplified in the end, is that we can't know one way or the other, but here we are, loved ones perish, we continue to be tossed in an ocean of suffering, and that god is perhaps the more attractive story to grim reality, it provides purpose and color, soothes the soul on her journey. This explains the Disney cleanliness, as his mind not dwelling on death.The sentiment makes sense of course, but suddenly reduces.Going back, you will see this reductive logic in places, reductive because it IS logic. The most telling spot for me is the following, it is the one that should be the most emotionally powerful moment in the film, the most purely visual because it is directly of the boy's soul. Among the visual meditations, there is the one of him being submerged in the sea to the quantum level of soul where images bubble up and form everything else, he goes past the animals, past the symbols, and settles on the face of his loved one, all of it illusory.It is of course the feeling that has arisen in him, but see how it is rendered. Schematic isn't it?Not unlike its notion of god, which reduces in retrospect by too simple sense. So keep this film to heart, it has its heart in the right place, but imagine how you would do the swim. Zen starry waters without the Disney luminescence maybe? I have similar issues with Koyannisqatsi's constructed nature.The magic in it being what it is, not constructed, revelatory as it is.","

"jebophos","25 August 2013","Life of Pi was simply amazing! It had that epic feel in spanning the young life of the title character beginning as a young boy - and then his adult self. Add to that the drama and sense of adventure and survival as he is stranded at sea with some animals and eventually the tiger, Richard Parker. Throw in some fantasy and exquisite cinematography with the nighttime scenes especially. And the cherry on top? The message of faith but not in a preachy way. I think some have tried to read into the religious aspect maybe too much in reading other reviews. This film IMO was generalizing to suit a purpose. It's pretty easy to figure out. This is one of those movies that sticks with you. I will be buying a copy on DVD for my permanent library. Ang Lee has done it again!","

"Grjas","5 September 2013","This was an outstanding movie that combines solid acting, great photography, outstanding special effects and an interesting plot line. I was puzzled at how the director could make a movie about a boy and a tiger in a boat interesting, but he does that in spades. It is especially interesting to try to determine which scenes with the tiger are real and which are Cgi. Other than looking closely at the eyes, it is often hard to determine. The transitions between real and artificial are so seamless, the tiger feels real throughout. The ending as well is something special and leaves room for your own interpretation.Highly recommended.","

Beautiful photography, excellent acting, original screenplay based on a sensitive and well recognized novel that, besides allowing enjoy a good movie with amazing scenes (surely many computer generated (CGI)) provides an elaborate metaphor for life, spirituality, struggle and all those elements that are presented to us throughout the different stages of our existence.

"Troy_Campbell","1 January 2013","A gorgeous motion picture that wears its heart proudly on its sleeve, this epic survival tale is sweet, poignant and thought-provoking. As castaway Pi (played in adolescent form capably by Suraj Sharma and as an adult by the phenomenal Irffan Khan) defies death whilst stranded on a boat with a ferocious Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker, themes such as religion, faith, companionship and solitude are all explored. The beauty in David Magee's screenplay (adapted from Yann Martel's best-selling novel) is that each audience member will walk away with their own opinions and feelings on the aforementioned themes, depending on intelligence, maturity and cultural upbringing. This is not a film about religion in itself, but the context is there if you wish to acknowledge it. Otherwise it's a movie about belief, and having the strength of conviction in whatever it is you do choose to believe in.If the story wasn't impressive enough, then Life of Pi also serves as a breathtaking display of visual splendour and wonderment. From the sweet opening credits to the majestic island that is inhabited by an untold number of meerkats in the final act, Ang Lee has put every ounce of effort behind the camera (and with his computer effects team) to create an awe-inspiring landscape, in 3D no less, for Pi to exist in. This is our world to be sure, but rarely has it been seen like this. Glowing jellyfish lighting up the way for a whale to jump out of the water at night, a sunrise mirrored in perfect symmetry by the still ocean or a gigantic freighter sinking to the plumbs of the Pacific; every shot is one of glorious realisation that could easily be photographed and hung on a wall. Most importantly, Richard Parker is rendered utterly believable thanks to the seamless combination of a real tiger and flawless CGI. A bona fide masterpiece.","

"lancequan2046","27 November 2012","A sad, violent and cruel story disguised as a fairy tale about a kid taming a tiger at sea. In Ang Lee's hands the book-to-film adaptation was thankfully not turned into something of a young Robinson Crusoe or a love story between a volleyball and a fat Hanks. At the same time none of the magical realism ""feel"" of the novel was lost in the adaptation / visual interpretation. Eventually the very bloody message of the story (humans are essentially beasts, we create religion or hallucinate about faith to help ourselves forgetting our bestial nature) was impressively preserved without the need to show almost any gore. Most importantly, the very sensitive topic of the conflicts and dependency of faith, religions, science and nature was beautifully narrated in the movie. The technicality demonstrated in Life Of Pi is everything on a magnificent, grandeur scale, yet at the same time the technicality does not over-shine Lee's nature as an intellectual – his yearning and pursuit for purity and beauty.I remember coming across a film review that called Lee's Life Of Pi ""preachy"", which seems to echo quite a few reviews on the book. Whoever said that, in my opinion, made a very basic mistake in understanding the purpose of the story. Both Martel's novel and Magee's script, not only never attempted to coax people to flock to religion or faith, but also put a rather nasty joke on religion and its forms. Yet at the same time in the end the protagonist of the story was able to maintain his faith, despite having some not-so-mild-natured joke cast onto his religions. ""Preachy""? Please. This looks more like a sacrilegious story to me.When I read the book, one of the things that impressed me the most was that Pi never for once cursed, sworn or truly lost it while drifting at sea, amidst all his suffering and misery. My guess is that reverence and hope never really left him, and that, is probably the true distinction between having a faith and not having one. Lee gave this rare, controlled and optimistic narration a beautiful stretch in his film – Pi had a happy ending by textbook definition. In the end, some might think of Lee as some semi-delusional intellect with wishful thinking, he is probably more willing to believe in the deity and beauty in human nature instead of looking into our bestial instincts. Or maybe, he is like the Indian girl in the film dancing Bharatanatyam – there is a blossoming lotus flower hidden somewhere in his heart.I am far more pessimistic than he is. I am constantly on guard in case my Richard Parker ambushes me and tears me into pieces, although I also know, there is probably still a lotus flower hidden somewhere in my heart.","

"mvedprakasha","28 March 2013","World is a zoo bearing many species of the life where each individual witnesses the minds and souls of others which actually represents the universal truth. Opening with the soothing voice the Indian classical music of Bombay Jayashree gives us the calmness that exists in the blue planet. The takeover of the story slowly grabs the impetus in the traditional method of the Irfan khan recollecting the olden days as though inculcating the thought process of mind which always moves back either into the history or toggles into the future and never stays in the present. The years of 1950's of newly born India's is well thought of to be a subject matter. The story giving a philosophical glimpse starts with Lord Krishna who symbolizes the ultimate bliss of life throughout his journey of life, by a way of circumscribing the entire Universe in his tiny little mouth is a valid way of representing the Pi responding to it while his brother doesn't. The interests of pi and his brother are varied throughout the movie. The hunger for knowledge awakened the pi while his brother was attracted by the fantasies of the world, cleanly represented by the holy water in the church. The senses of hearing of Allah did not affect Ravi but the listening Allah touched the ears of Pi. The concept of Absurdity is also meaningfully taken into the story by the introduction of Albert Camus to the pi. The worldly fascination doesn't give the ""Anand(i)"" is very well depicted in the movie. The concentration of the fact of Darwin's theory of ""struggle for existence"" is shown at every step of the movie such as his father's business mind where he thinks to move to Canada, and also by the fact in the life boat where at the point where he kills the fishes to feed himself and the fierce Richard parker. The conflict in the mind about the killing of the fishes (other species) for the one's own survival on this planet is the lively truths of past, present and the futuristic tendencies of the world. The colors about the godly islands which shall mark the origin of the all the energy which starts with the birth of cold and healthy water lakes along the sunrise and dawns with the water being acidic in nature turning wild to end the life of many species also seems relevant to life. The realization of the nature's thunder storm-god paradox is brought evidently to depict the curiosity (JIGNYASA) to know the world, one self and God .The simile of Tiger to that of the soul of the pi is very interesting. Life is a journey of the body and the soul in this planet to evolve or reach a destined destination. On finishing the journey body shall cry for the loss of the soul, nevertheless the soul is liberated without even bidding the good bye, becomes one with the universal eternal energy. The tiger which represents the depth of the pi, departs without any hesitation deep into the forests brings the end of the 25 years story in 3 hours. The making of the movie and the 3d effects and photography has really made it worth the golden statues. The editing and the Foley have made it supportive to the great Oscars.","

"MrGKB","14 March 2013","...are joyously outweighed by its sheer visual brilliance and embrace of life and love. Being a translation of a novel means ""Life of Pi"" can be, at times, a bit confusing perhaps, but the overall narrative remains strong, and the protagonist is such a rich, well-defined character that the viewer can't help being drawn into the story. I won't belabor things; others have done that quite nicely elsewhere on this site. Let it simply be said that this is a film that any cinemaphile will enjoy, perhaps even despite whatever prejudices or predilections they may suffer.

"koki400","6 March 2014","I must say that this movie has one of the worst endings I have ever seen. It was all a dream or the evil character is all in my head ain't got nothing on this movie. I am not trolling I will say that life of pi is beautifully shot and it is moving at times. However, Spoiler alert...the basic structure of this movie is ""narrator"" at the beginning ""let me tell you a story that is so fantastical you wont believe it."" Viewer at the end ""Oh my, did that really happen...I...I..don't believe it."" Narrator ""I told you..the reason you don't believe it.,is cause I made the whole thing up."" We then are treated to the real story which is suppose to be so terrible that he made up this ""loose"" story about animals which is some vague metaphor of the truth blah blah. The real insulting part is when the old codger ask the writer...which story do you prefer. The premise, plot, and ending of both stories are the same but do you like the one with the cuddly zoo animals or the one where we use people as bait and I watch my mother get killed. The writer and the audience in unison say...tear rolling down cheek..the one with the tiger...the end. The point being some pseudo intellectual notion that watching your mother die or being raped or insert whatever horrible thing could happen to you is all a mindset or how we choose to deal with it. OK I get it, a positive attitude can do wonders. But seriously if you survive something like the holocaust I would rather just hear the version that is the truth rather than the version where Adolf Hitler is mickey mouse and you were in Narnia the whole time. I mean come on..this is so insulting on so many different levels. First off, if you are going to tell me this stupid made up story abut honey badgers and unicorns..then stick to it like a crazy person...don't tell me the real story right afterwords. Cause you know what my reaction is going to be, not oh my god what a cute story I like the first one better. My reaction is going to be oh crap you watched your mother get hacked to pieces and you made up a story about it involving zoo animals and then you ask me isn't the first story better...um yes it is...but the story of Anne frank would be better if she was cat woman and died at the end fighting crime...but alas that's not what happened..nor is it the story I prefer.","

"Staffenburgen","15 January 2013","Wow. That's really the only word that comes to mind. Watching this for the first time a few days ago, I found myself in a perpetual state of awe; this movie is an absolute work of art. This will be a short review, since it's virtually impossible to say much without giving anything away. The film starts with a small introduction into the life of Pi. It explains exactly how he came to have that name, and how he came to be stranded in the middle of the ocean in only the company of a fierce Bengal tiger. The rest of the story that ensues is absolutely top-notch; I really can't give this film enough praise. The narrative is extremely visceral and interpretive, filled to the brim with symbolism, and the conclusion is very satisfying.As far as acting goes, I was thoroughly impressed. The lead actor is very strong here; he is the only actor on screen for almost a full hour in the middle, and he knocks it out of the park. Now, the truly incredible part. This film is shot in spectacular 3D and I have never seen it used better. Seriously. People in the theater were literally gasping in awe as some of the more engaging visuals flashed on the screen. The viewer is completely immersed; you feel like you're a part of Pi's universe, stranded right there with him on that boat.This is one of the year's best films. It's as simple as that. I give it my highest recommendation. RATING: 9/10","

"LeonLouisRicci","13 April 2013","Visually stimulating but hardly Spiritually uplifting this Film tries so hard to be Philosophically relevant that it drowns in its own excessive pretensions. Especially after the Revelation. What is meant to be an Epiphany is more like an Exorcism.It pulls so hard at the Soul that it is a painful extraction of belief and Faith. A watering down of deep convictions and hopeful beliefs. The message here is not well grounded and is left floating about meandering every which way and is so heavy handed that it can be a detriment to its own determined thesis. Undeniably stunning at times it is the disjointed editing and the completely cop out ending coupled with the thick Theology that keeps this from being completely successful in the way of The Way. There is simply so much shallowness to the Script that it is barely saved by the expanse and the exciting vistas. Probably better enjoyed if you let go and take the voyage with as little intellect as possible and nary a search for Enlightenment.","

"Alenbalz","29 May 2014","Fantastic photography, and a really entertaining storyline that has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The director has added another feather to his cap of great cinematic achievements. Beautiful scenery and vivid colors, makes you marvel at the wonders of nature, some fantastic ocean storm waves, showing just how big and powerful the ocean really is. But let's not forget this is a fictional movie, and like the Superman or The Hulk etc etc, movies, it's very believable and engaging. In a broad sense, it's also a treatise about mans faith and belief in religion and a God, a personal vs an Abstract God, told allegorically; a boy on a life boat with some other survivors, depicted as wild animals, and towards the end of the movie alluded to be humans (and more specifically inhumane humans), all vieing for survival. It's left up to the viewer to choose which story-line they prefer to believe in: and the analogy to which religion/God they prefer to believe in. So if you can come way from a Superman or Batman movie without it challenging your faith and belief in the real world around you, this movie should be approached in the same way, with the added bonus, that you might view your relationship with reality and religion afresh.","

"EmmaDinkins","23 November 2012","As someone who had not read the Life of Pi book, I really did not have any knowledge of this story or what to expect other than what I had seen in the trailer. It seemed like it would be an interesting enough tale and I was curious about what had transpired to bring a young man and a Bengal tiger together in a life boat. This was a spiritual journey that I was so thrilled to have experienced on the big screen. The entire story was filled with opposing ideologies beginning with Pi's discovery of religion. It was interesting that he was able to take a rational look at various religions and apply the teachings to his life that were beneficial, even life saving. The Life of Pi was profoundly engaging, I knew that Pi (Suraj Sharma) would survive the lost at sea ordeal, but none of the intensity of the story was diminished as a result of knowing the outcome. The imagery in this film was spectacular, from the opening scene credits I knew that I was in for a treat when a hummingbird was just inches from my face and literally within my reach. The scenes in which the ocean and the star filled sky seemed to merge into one were breathtaking. I made it a point to view this film in 3-D and it was worth every penny of the premium uplift, and we all know that not all 3-D films are. I'm not sure why anyone would mention Avatar and this film in the same context, although I just did because of the reference in the trailer, but other than the luminescent sea life, the two films have so little in common that it's like someone was reaching to describe the feeling that this story evokes. I love stories that showcase triumph of the human spirit as was the case with this one, but best of all you leave the theater feeling good about life in general, not guilty that your life has been average and happy, not shadowed by some tragedy that makes you evolve into a different person. The two stories told in this film that detailed what happened to Pi (Irrfan Khan) were opposites, I too preferred the one that featured Richard Parker. I was not a fan of the Cowboy story directed by Ang Lee, but am truly enamored by this Indian story, cowboys and Indians still dealing with opposites. This was a good story and I give it a green light.","

"Likes_Ninjas90","23 December 2012","Based on the 2001 novel by Yann Martel, Life of Pi is the metaphysical and spiritual journey of a character who must question their physical endurance and willingness to sustain their faith in God. This character is named Pi Patel and we first see him in present day Canada as a man (played by Irrfan Khan) who is preparing to tell an amazing story to a writer (Rafe Spall). Pi's story begins at a young age when he is a schoolboy in India. His parents are strict but intelligent and run a zoo with a huge array of animals. The film traces Pi's life to when he is a young man (Suraj Sharma), who is reluctant to join his parents once they sell the zoo and move overseas. Once onboard a Japanese ship transporting the zoo animals to be sold, a huge storm floods the vessel and Pi is separated from his family. He finds himself in a lifeboat with a zebra and somehow survives the storm. A fantasy adventure of imagination begins, where several other animals emerge from under the covers of the lifeboat, including a tiger. Fearful of the tiger, Pi resorts to building himself a mini raft attached to the boat. He must use a survival guide and other skills to control the tiger and retake the lifeboat. Director Ang Lee has never made the same film twice. His constant versatility and creative mind for unique visual spaces defines his work. His films including Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain each adopted a unique filmic style appropriate to the material. Only someone with such diverse and sophisticated formal knowledge like Lee could have made Life of Pi work as well as it does. Once deemed unfilmable, the film's visual sophistication bridges the gap between an art house project and mainstream blockbuster. Its stunning visual qualities do not stand isolated but provide cinematic representations of complex philosophical questions surrounding myths, religion and faith. In lesser hands this might have been a more bloated, less intelligent film. Before Lee, the project was passed between several directors including Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Alfonso Cuaron and M. Night Shyamalan, all of whom are considered visual stylists. Lee's personal strength as a filmmaker is that he rarely allows images to be devoid of meaning. His approach to this complex material is wholly cinematic: he challenges the audience to draw meaning from the properties of the screen and the images, realising a film that is in equal parts dazzling, thoughtful and ambiguous. The only stumbling points are the early scenes where Lee deters from his cinematic approach. The jumble of anecdotes, including Pi being named after a swimming pool, are confused and estranged from the rest of the film. But the screenplay by David Magee finds its footing once it adopts a linear structure to tell Pi's life story. Expositional dialogue is skilfully masked as provocative philosophical statements, which are then attached to the film's Biblical imagery. The film's midsection, spent almost exclusively on the raft with the animals, visualises Pi's desolated world and draws parallels to stories like Noah's Ark. The animals in these scenes are a powerful example of Lee's emphasis on combing theme and image. Early in the film Pi shows great interest in the tiger. But his father says to him: ""When you look into its eyes, you see only your own emotions reflected back at you"". This statement is problematised by the displacement of the animals on the raft. Are the animals real or part of Pi's imagination? The animals, I think, reflect Pi's shifting emotional states. When Pi is afraid, the tiger shows more aggression. When he learns to tame the animal, it shows more control. These images are also allegories for God's own existence. If one fears God, like Pi fears the dominance of the tiger, doesn't that project our own vision of God in our minds? The basis of the film is therefore how much faith we are willing to place into something that might only be a state of mind. Using a number of aesthetic devices, the film makes a dazzling case for the power of imagination and visual stylisation over conventional naturalism. Colour desaturation is used purposely, with the white tones of Pi's clothes stressing his desire for a cleansing experience on the boat but perhaps also to show impending death given the unlikelihood of his survival. The tiger's half of the boat is coloured red. It matches the colour of tiger to instigate a place of fear that Pi must overcome. Lee also allows his camera to be unconstricted by reality. The fluidity and tilting movements of the camera are used to stunning effect in a storm sequence that takes on Biblical and apocalyptic proportions. There are gentler moments of great power too, where Lee opts to take us deep under the ocean, delivering some of the most striking images in cinema. Abstract and impressionistic images, like a sea of blue neon lights under the ocean, are enhanced spectacularly by bursts of colour and unintrusive 3D effects. To define precisely what these scenes mean, and many others including a bizarre episode involve thousands of fish and an island of meerkats, would be futile. The film isn't concerned with facts, logic or realism. It stresses how stories and myths inspire our survival as a species. Posing a belated question about what type of stories we would rather hear, inspiring fantasy or scientific rationale like the survival of the fittest, is clever because the answer is predetermined by the amazing things we've already seen. There's a small end moment where the film undermines its sophisticated ambiguity by explaining a twist too neatly but minor quibbles never deter from the power of Lee's craftsmanship. Life of Pi has the spectacle of a blockbuster but compliments its flair with heart and intelligence - compelling reasons see this astonishing film on the big screen.","

"davidgee","4 January 2013","You already know the story. Emigrating to Canada with his family on a rust-bucket freighter, an Indian zoo-keeper's son is the sole survivor when the ship goes down in a storm. Not quite the sole survivor: he shares his lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orang-utang . . . and a magnificent Bengal tiger improbably named Richard Parker. Mr Parker soon eats his companions, apart from young Pi Patel who retreats to a raft made of debris strung out behind the lifeboat. They survive on the lifeboat's rations and some fortuitous fish catches until they beach on a floating island populated by mongooses (not mongeese, I just looked it up). Over time they reach an uneasy truce, but the script is at pains not to sentimentalise their relationship.Apart from Rafe Spall as the writer to whom the adult Pi is telling his tale (and a cameo by Gerard Depardieu), all the cast are Indians. Suraj Sharma, who plays the castaway Pi, is not one of those preposterously handsome Asian stars, he's quite ordinary looking (actually I was reminded of an Indian version of Labour leader Ed Milliband!) but as natural an actor as SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE's Dev Patel. The animals are mostly CGI but very believable, especially the fabulous Richard Parker. The storm scenes are spectacular; in 3D you almost need to put an umbrella up.The movie is perhaps a tad too long, but it's never tedious. The feeling of being taken on an adventure rarely lets up. Full marks to Ang Lee, a director whose career has taken many a crowd-pleasing turn. This is a magical alternative to the Christmas pantomime.","

"thinker1691","18 September 2013","Director Ang Lee teamed up with writer Yann Martel to craft this imaginative tale for the silver screen. It relates the story of a young Indian boy named Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) growing up in India with a caring family and an acute sense of curiosity. Pressed by a sense of wonder and an insatiable drive to understand life, Pi and his family undergo a long and dangerous sea voyage aboard a Japanese cargo vessel. Encountering a huge storm and a shipwreck, Pi soon finds himself alone in a lifeboat with the remnants of what used to be a Zoo. The struggle to survive in a boat is arduous enough, but to maintain himself and a hungry Begal Tiger is doubly difficult. Still, the adventure taken by Pi to strange places unknown, prompts questions which lie between reality and mystical illusion. In addition the fantastic movie invites the audience to experience the incredible and harrowing ordeal with him. The result is a film not easily forgotten especially with the help of international stars like Gerard Depardieu. Easily recommended to all. ****","

"arunjyotiu","23 December 2012","As I hail from India and the cast and storyline of this film revolves around an Indian family, our traditions and specifically our national animal it appealed to me in the first place than our own Bollywood flicks as well as other English movies.Its my bad that I haven't heard of the name of the novel but as I saw this film I enjoyed it very much due to its AMAZING 3D in the first place. But when I viewed it 2 more times I tried to understand the deep meaning beneath the uncommon name.We all know Pi is an irrational number but without which rationality cannot be achieved as explained in the euclidean geometry. Similarly faith although inexplicable by science but it can be the greatest tool to make impossible possible; quoting the Psalms: ""Trust unto god and He shall direct your path"". A child's innocence has always have been an object of humor to the adults but its the meaning we try to avoid by laughing away. And so Pi Patel's father tries to reason with his young son saying that he sees his own emotions reflected back from the eyes of the tiger. But this is how GOD watches upon all of us, no? Actually the power to do good, to do a miracle lies in all of us. What we lack is the courage and that's why we pray, expect Him to do our work. But fortune always favors the brave and victory loves preparation. Being shipwrecked Pi haven't forgot his trust, faith, belief, courage and above all hope. and these made him survive 227 days in pacific ocean growing a symbiotic relationship with the majestic Bengal tiger for survival or we may say GOD in form of the tiger. But during that time GOD made him see what we yearn to see our whole life: the heavenly beauty of His creation both known and unknown, explored and unexplored and also made him realize not to stop until the goal is achieved for which he escaped the sleeping lady shaped island. So after being landed in the shores of Mexico Pi sought, goodbye from the tiger but its justified why it didn't turn back. GOD is all the time watching us, treading beside us so why would he say goodbye? It finally comes to us what we believe and what we choose to believe. And I will say Yann Martel and Ang Lee has both succeeded in delivering this ultimate message.","

"billygoat1071","11 January 2013","Life of Pi is a story about a boy who tests his faith and beliefs while being stranded in the middle of the ocean after their ship got sunk by a storm. It's ought to be an inspiring tale to make one believe in God. In the end, there's only few questions to ask, but what made this spectacular is the amazing use of special effects and the direction. You do not always get a film as gorgeous and as highly enjoyable as this one. It's one of the best kinds of experiences you'll get in cinemas. It has real tension, humor, and emotional depth, but the real landmark here is the visuals that are undeniably spellbinding.The beginning is quite intriguing as it talks about faith and its morality, but the conundrum disappointingly ends up being less subtle in execution. Despite of that, we still get to see something extraordinary. One is a genuine fortitude in every suspenseful and emotional moment which practically compels the whole picture. The other is obviously the visuals. Ang Lee interestingly turned the survival into a whimsical and surreal exterior that made this look so remarkable like when the water perfectly reflects the stars in the sky or the lightning struck at the entire ocean during a harsh storm. The CGI-ed animals are amazing how they move and act like real animals. The enjoyable bits is when Pi interacts with those band of misfits. The film is in 3D and yep, there are plenty of things jumped off the screen(noticeably changes ratio aspect in one sequence), but it also shows some interesting use of it.There's only few things to say about this since I haven't read the book(rule breaker here), but I'll say it has the same root of Cloud Atlas. The message isn't overwhelmingly executed but the technical achievements and the direction made it a powerful cinematic experience. It could have been a much better experience if it's strong to its themes, but it's all stunning anyway. Life of Pi is a compelling cinematic journey with endless visual wonders.","

"ramesh-khanna","23 November 2012","Astounding movie experience!! Gripping story line that keeps you involved, and at the same time is simple and thought provoking. You start becoming / living the life of Pi as the film progresses and that is the real achievement of the movie. You are not a passive movie audience anymore.Most of you may not be aware, but ""Life of Pi"" is loosely based on the TRUE STORY of a person who survived a shipwreck along with a Jaguar. Yann Martel's 2001 Book ""Life of Pi"" on which the movie is based upon was in-turn based on Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella ""Max and the Cats"", which in-turn was based on a true story.The quality of the 3D graphics are so real that few scenes may scare the children, but this is too good a movie to skip just because of this fact. Watch it, and then watch it again. This movie may well end up becoming one of your Top10 movies of all time.Simply great!! Two thumbs and two toes up :-)","

The only survivors are Pi, a hyena, a zebra, and a tiger named Richard Parker, who find themselves in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean.On the plus side, I liked that the movie was faithful to the book. The photography and special effects were breathtaking; director Ang Lee has created a dreamy, magical, and stunningly beautiful world for Pi. The CGI tiger was excellent; I could not tell when he was drawn and when he was real. The soundtrack is lovely.On the down side, I found myself glancing at my watch at times, wondering when it would be over. The pace was too slow for me and I think it would have been an even better movie had 15 minutes been cut from it.The acting was outstanding and fans of the wonderful book will not be disappointed.","

Nothing like telling it too fast, or too little, or too much.This is the great movie with a great story.

"lbjtheking","10 January 2013","I liked this movie for many different reasons. The first is because of the amazing special effects. I didn't even see the film in 3D and I was still amazed by the magical scenes created. They felt like you could actually be there, experiencing them as Pi is. Another reason I really enjoyed this movie was because of how deeply it digs into and explores the heart and soul of the character of Pi. This amazing young actor does a great job of portraying the raw emotions of one trapped at sea. It is believable, entertaining, and understandable all at the same time. Its almost like a character study wrapped up with a visually spectacular adventure. It is one of the must-see movies of 2012. Do yourself a favor and take the time to really enjoy this great movie.","

How else? He embraced virtually every religion out there.Is this smart movie? Did it make you to think about anything? I did not find any single thought in this movie. Boring, annoying, terrible and painful to watch for 2 hours. Total waste of time and money in case you happened to see this in 3D.Now, having said my opinion about movie, I am going to see who are reviewers.

"narine_tevosyan","15 February 2019","I've watched this movie twice, and I understood it both times differently. This story touches various themes, and I think that after each viewing you focus on one thing. Thus, I think that it is about survival, faith, and friendship. All these aspects are shown with the help of the main character, who had gone through all these difficulties. In particular, in this movie, we see a strong character, who managed to survive the hardships, suffering, pain, and loss in the Pacific Ocean. During the whole this period we learn a lot of lessons, which are crucial for our knowledge. One of them is that we should always have faith, even when we are in a hopeless situation. We see how Pi believed that God had been protecting him during the whole time and we really see that God didn't forget him and he managed to survive there. Moreover, we see that his character also played a big role in his survival. Pi didn't give up hope, and he kept moving. This factor shows that it is essential not to give up on your dreams and give up on life. In addition, I want to say that I liked the part when this movie showed that the world believes someone for what they want to hear, not for reality. This is, unfortunately, a real truth.","

Yes, the visual effects are amazing, but is so much more than Ang Lee showing off his cinematographic prowess. The story is very emotional, and quite unique as it involves a boy and a tiger. Not only emotional, but spiritual too.Excellent CGI. You would swear there was a real tiger, zebra, hyena etc in the boat with Pi.Solid performances from a cast of unknowns (the only well-known actor in the movie is Gerard Depardieu, and his role is fairly minor). Suraj Sharma is great as Pi.","

One day, his family have an accident while they sail. Only he survives with Richard Parker. The graphics in this film is beautiful very much. I was overwhelmed by the scene of a whale and island. This story was different with my expectation, therefore, the development was surprising for me. I felt that I wanted to know how did Richard Parker think to Pi. I want everyone to watch this film.

The most visually stunning movie of the year. My only ""flaw"" with the film would probably be pi's relationship with his crush. I mean, she isn't a horrible actress or anything, but I felt it could've just been a little bit stronger and more developed. Oh well. Besides that, Life of Pi is just a flawless film, save for the romance. The runners up would probably be Moonrise kingdom, The dark knight rises, Argo, and The avengers. those films are just as equally great but whenever someone points a gun at my head and asks me what the best film of 2012 is, I would have to say Life of Pi. final score: 10/10","

Now, let's get this straight. Life of Pi has just shown that thereis life left in 3D. It may be, on the whole, a gimmick but the exception can still prove the point. Only two movies have made the 3D entrance fee worth the extra IMHO, Avatar and this. It's a tough movie for bibliophiles to even want to see because thebook is so magnificent (in my all time top ten probably) and many I've spoken to who love it equally are just downright scared that Ang Lee was going to blow it. The odds were strongly in favour ofthat happening because it's a pretty full on philosophical workout. So full credit has to go to Fox pictures for shelling out $120 million on the ultimate movie gamble. How Ang manages to retain the existential angst of the book AND make a blockbuster movie that holds the attention from start to finish (yes, including the pretty turgid first 100 pages) is not only anyone's guess but a cinematic achievement of considerable merit. It's the storytelling that wins the day but it's wrapped up in cinematography of the very highest order. So many times one gasps out loud at what's on screen that it's like a day out in a theme park. Surely the Oscar for this is certain to go to Claudio Miranda (Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac, Benjamin Button). The acting is universally good but it's the tiger, Richard Parker, and his four legged companions that really steal the show. CGI has never, ever been this good. This might sound like it's the technology that carries the movie but don't think that. It's an honest, stunning exploration of the true meaning of life, religion and truth and it's an absolute must see. I would not discount it winning best movie come early March and I certainly wouldn't grudge it. Ang Lee's finest hour.","

That and some decent visual effects and nice photography.As for the story - there is not much there. It starts with ""The story will make you believe in God"" or something to that effect, but there is no place for God in it. Some claim it is meant to prove non-existence of God... but I did not see it that way. It is too blah to have anything in it really.Bottom line: in the world where true mysticism and symbolism is lost, there is no shortage of pretentious works of ""art"" (film, novels, or anything else) which gladly promises to bring some new value. They all have a few things in common:Story originates in a far away land and/or timeIt is based on some completely unimportant and ridiculous premise that only young teenagers may be interested in itIt is visually richWhether it is Life of PI or any other similarly dumb fantasy such as Harry Potter or Lord Of The Ring, it does not really matter. They all require that the consumer have low expectations, poor understanding of human condition, and is easily entertained with anything that seems even a little ""different"".Often, forced attempts to be different brings us just more of the same, and Life Of PI does just that.","

"u-70359","21 January 2020","Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a beautiful adaptation of a bestselling novel by Yann Martel. It chronicles a young mansu journey to survive after a storm leaves him stranded in the middle of the ocean. The film is colorful and draws the viewer in from the beginning.The story starts as the young Pi is a child in India. His family owns a zoo. Early on we see the dangers of how fierce these animals can be and why they are in cages. Pi father makes the difficult decision to close the zoo when it goes broke. The family and a few precious animals board a ship headed to Canada. Along the way a storm sinks the ship leaving Pi as the only survivor along with a few of the zoo animals. They are cast adrift in the ocean and forced to survive with the hopes of being rescued. This reminds me of James Cameron's ""Titanic"" (1997), when Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet we're clinging to life in the cold Atlantic waiting for a rescue boat.The director and cinematographer use several camera angles and CGI (computer generated images) to detail the boys journey. The tiger is obviously CGI although some real animals were used in close up shots. The camera appears to be in the water following the boy, this is the viewpoint we see. Almost all of the movie takes place on open water. They do land on a floating island with trees and plenty of food to eat.The script is relatively short on dialogue. 75% of the movie I'd Pi on his own. The story gets detailed on how he adapts to life on a raft with a bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Due to natural selection the tiger is the last remaining animal. He and Pi end up having a mutual respect and understanding while adrift. Most of the script is told in the narration of Pi's journey.The young actor does a great job of seeming unmoved by the events that happened to him. One would think he is either in shock or somehow accepting of what happened to his family. Never once does he give up. He makes the view believe he is confident in finding a way to survive. In the end you feel his sadness when his companion, the bengal tiger, walks away into the jungle.The movie does move along slowly, but I blame that on screenwriter David Magees lack of material. The bulk of the story takes place at sea and perhaps it could've moved along faster if the director and writer would've used flashbacks to Pi's life. This could've been used to move the journey along and also give viewers a chance to connect with Pi on a more human level by showing how important his family was.I highly recommend ""Life of Pi"" for its beautiful cinematography and endearing story. The young actor is bold and believable and the CGI did a good job of showing the viewer this fierce beast. It's 127 minutes which could've been shortened up with a few changes in script but overall one of the best movies of 2012.","

"raulfaust","9 March 2014","The summary is the phrase that made me wanna see this picture. It's been written in the movie's cover, and considering I read good reviews about it everywhere, I decided renting it. Many people put this movie in the same level as modern classics like ""Titanic"", and I think I disagree with them. The first half of the movie is completely involving, thanks to a good directing, scenario and performances. I really entered the Indian ambient and recognized beauty in everything of their culture-- and I constantly pictured young Pi as Rajesh from ""The Big Bang Theory"". The family concerns are universal and convincing, which is a good step in the story: something everyone can be related to. However, the boat scenes in which Pi has to live with the tiger didn't impress me that much. Firstly, due to the fact that the tiger felt very fake, and anyone could easily notice it was pure CGI. In fact, every animal in the ark felt computerized. Secondly, because they took too long. The ending, on the other hand, has a beautiful message about what really happened, and it doesn't let you know which of Pi's stories was the real one. Either way, the doubt is intelligent and provoking, so you'll not have a clichéd outcome. In my opinion, it doesn't beat up movies like ""Titanic"" and ""The Green Mile"", but it's a good entertainment with some new ideas.","

"l_rawjalaurence","14 July 2013","LIFE OF PI is quite simply a visual feast of spectacle. From the Indian locations of Pondicherry in the past, to the sequences taking place at sea, a quite wonderful evocation of an uninhabited island where the plants are predatory, to the final sequence taking place in sunlit suburbia in Canada, the film is full of memorable images. The moments involving the animals - especially Richard Parker the tiger - are equally memorable; if they have been created using CGI, they certainly did not seem so. Director Ang Lee has a wonderful way of suggesting the animal's predatory nature, yet at the same time its straightforwardness (unlike the human characters). At the same time, I have to admit that the plot of LIFE OF PI is slight, to say the least: one can understand the central character's desire to discover himself and his relationship to God, but the progress of moving towards self-awareness is sometimes a slow one. The film drags on occasions; one wishes that more character- conflict had been introduced, especially involving Gérard Depardieu, who has a memorable cameo as an obstreperous ship's cook.","

Pi grows up in India where his parents own a zoo. He is teased at school due to his name but he is smart and aims for the attractive girl in the music class for which he plays an instrument. When his father receives possible job opportunities in Canada they load up some of the animals for sale and set sail via ship but a nasty storm hits. Pi is the only survivor as he shivers in a lifeboat in terror as the ship rapidly sinks. His only company is an injured zebra, an orangutan, a spotted hyena, and a Bengal tiger. When hunger takes effect the hyena kills the zebra and later on the orangutan but is demolished in return by the first appearance of the tiger. Central plot regards Pi struggling to adapt to living with this tiger and the fascinating adventure they endure, which he narrates now in his fifties to a writer who takes in every spoken word with great interest. Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi narrating his experience, while Suraj Sharma plays the younger Pi who uses every possible resource to survive and co-exist with a tiger. Adil Hussain plays his strict yet resourceful father who questions Pi's introduction to Christianity. Rafe Spall plays the writer who is asked ""which"" story he prefers. Gerard Depardieu plays a cruel and vulgar cook aboard the ship. This is a powerful visually stunning masterpiece about a life of tolerance and victory. Score: 10 / 10","

"JTMokko","12 May 2013","Life of Pi was a disappointment. Framework of the story, with a reporter interviewing Pi, was totally unnecessary - it made it difficult to get involved with the fate of the main character - after all he would survive to live conventional suburban life. Story didn't move me at all. Whole time I was just wondering are the filmmakers selling this story as a real story, based on a fact, or as a fantasy film. As a 'based on a true story' it could not happen - tiger would eat a scrawny Indian boy in a heartbeat if it was truly hungry and the whole island thing didn't help the realism at all. As a fantasy film, the story needed magic carpet ride and a giant - that would do it. In the frame story the reporter said that: ""You had a story that would make me believe in God."" That was setting the aspiration of the story quite high. I was ready to yell ""Hallelujah"" or ""Allah Akbar"" in the moment story would do it's magic, but it really never happened. Story shouldn't promise something that it can't deliver.Special effects were very good and actors did their job well - although I was surprised that Depardieu had so little screen time. Better survival film would be Cast away (2000) and better depiction of storm was in The Perfect Storm (2000).","

"nickmesafilms","8 December 2012","Known as the one man who will take various risks of making a movie out of almost every single film genre imaginable, Ang Lee, of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" fame, directs his latest hit, ""Life of Pi"", based on the popular novel of the same name. It's that rare movie that will transport audiences into a world unlike no other, succeeding to entertain in both visual style and story. This is one of the most memorable, and one of the very best films of the whole year. ""Life of Pi"" tells the brave story of a young teen nicknamed ""Pi"", whom ends up on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, accompanied by a ferocious Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker (I know, it's weird). But I know what you're wondering, ""How did these two unfortunate souls ended up in this mess in the first place?"". Well, without spoiling anything, it's told through the point of view of older Pi, played by Irrfan Khan, as he tells a writer his entire life story, from his experiences at his family zoo, to a massive shipwreck during a journey to Canada for Pi and his family to start a new life, and how it lead to a situation considered impossible where Pi, as a teenager, got stuck on a lifeboat for weeks, with a tiger! Filmed in gorgeously breathtaking 3-D technology, ""Life of Pi"" is one absolute visual marvel. Director Ang Lee has thrown in some of the most beautiful images ever seen on the silver screen, and uses these images as his own unique way to tell the story. I recommend that everybody should see this movie in the theater, in the 3-D format, on the largest screen possible. It's a better way to experience this visual spectacle with such a massive scope. From a technical standpoint, ""Life of Pi"" succeeds in the use of cinematography, editing, and visual effects. But from a performance standpoint, while Irffan Khan does one of his best performances as older Pi, the scene-stealing breakthrough performance comes from Suraj Sharma, who does a rather brilliant job in capturing the heroism of young Pi, while at the same time, trying to communicate with a computer-generated tiger. It's a performance that I hope will score him his first ever Best Actor nomination. His relationship with this tiger is something to enjoy to watch unfold on screen. Their various face-offs with each other show the accurate profession of animals between humans. Although sharing complete loath between each other in the beginning, we find a strange friendship somewhere, as well. This movie delivers every human emotion to the audience, whether making you laugh, cry, or giving you a strange feeling of hope. At a well-paced 127-minute running time, ""Life of Pi"" is one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had. From start to finish, Ang Lee has brought me on board for an incredible ride, while finishing off with an ending that will definitely leave a smile on your face. The incredible visuals, the spell-binding cinematography and editing, the stand-out performance from Suraj Sharma, Ang Lee's masterful directing, and the movie itself, are all worthy of Oscar consideration. ""Life of Pi"", in my review, ""visually enhancing, a masterful journey"".","

"jcmann01","25 January 2013","Warning: This review does contains spoilers, but PLEASE come back after seeing movie and then read it.I saw the Life of Pi, in which the author attempts to make a few deeper points known about ""What the Truth is,"" whether it be something that is easily believable with our minds or something that you just have to take on faith. In the end, the question is left up to the viewer to decide for themselves. In the movie, Pi, tells the writer that he was going to get him to believe in God by the end of the story, but this is left somewhat mysterious when all is said and done in the movie.So, I will attempt to interpret what Pi was wanting to convey in the movie. I believe that intention here was to present 2 different stories about events that took place. The first story was what Pi actually experienced, but was so incredible, it sounded like he had made it up to cover his pain. The second story sounded more believable because it made sense, but much doubt was eventually cast on it. In the end the first story was prevailed as being the truth, which had to be taken by faith.MY Theological Interpretation:Over the centuries the Bible, in which the stories have been passed down from generation to generation were believed so much that this country's education system was based on the Bible during the 17th century. Now a days, with scientific points of view prevailing, much of the Bible is regarded by many as mere folklore stores that were told around fires and unbelievable to the questioning and the scoffers. So some take it upon themselves to create religions that may seem more believable and rationale to the majority. So they write books explaining the Bible to their followers.Many have mocked the story of Moses crossing the Red Sea and being very exaggerated, but now we have archaeological evidence of it's truth and still, many refuse to believe the truth. Like Pi's stories, there can only be one truth that prevails in the end and that is what actually happened and not what made sense to those who listen. It is also interesting to note that Pi's life was preserved over the ocean for 270 days with a fierce Tiger and yet he survived the ordeal, which is a credit to Psalm 91.Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. What this means is that God will not reveal himself to the faithless and those who constantly question His Word. Christians have a responsibility to give their testimony before the world, but like the 2 Japanese guys, the world fails to believe their testimony of the truth, but would prefer to believe in something that makes more sense to their minds.PS It is by no coincidence that the character was named Pi, because their is no finite answer to this equation if you try to reason it out with your mind.","

"abidsuhail","23 November 2012","With all the hype of a bestseller novel turning into a 3D movie, Life of Pi would possibly be the highly overrated movie of the year. Of course, it greatly impresses with its verisimilitude of the digital imagery, which is painstakingly constructed with one step on the fantasy and another on reality. I think this is so far the best imagery shot/created for a oceanic film and Richard Parker, the tiger is a marvel. Though, I was initially disappointed with the narrower aspect ratio 1.85:1; would've been more spectacular in 2.35:1But, where the movie (and the Novel) falls in its entirety is the drama, which is said to be constructed in tangence to spiritual overtones which justifies the Indian milieu ; the so called philosophy it offers is so very juvenile and text-bookish, (at-least that's how it would be for an Indian); the characters so flat and sketchy and casting over the top, detailing really bad and the authenticity in the soup (Tamil Talkie parts especially). Wondering if they hired a (right) cultural consultant. And this makes the first 25 minutes terrible to watch. Yes, all this is supposed to be carried from the original content by Yann Martel (which I consider an Yawn inducer).Having read the book and unimpressed, my only reason to watch Life of Pi in cinemas was Ang Lee. The man, in one of his interviews has said, he did have an initial hesitation and did contemplate a lot before taking up this project. I think one has to follow their intuition in creative matters and wish Ang Lee did that.So, if you've read the book, you know what to expect plot wise, and you'd be anticipating Ang Lee's visual interpretation, which is sure to enthrall you. And if you have not read the book, even better, the anticipation of 'where is this leading' might keep you engaged; only that at the end when the destination arrives, you might be left unsatisfied. 5/10 for the visual magnificence.","

"TaylorYee94","2 May 2021","'Life of Pi' satisfies all the requirements a movie should accomplish. Imaginary and interesting story but not too far-off from the reality: magical setting and enhanced visual art the reality cannot provide: messages to communicate with audience. It is such a pleasure to find a gem that assures all three, mentioned above like a treasure hunt, and I have found another one right here.Plot: right in the middle of reality and imagination, a perfect recipe to create a captivating story. Movie plot has to be more exciting, dramatic, and adventurous than ordinary life, but it cannot lose grip of reality such as probability or morality. It is implied that what have actually happened in the boat might be more truthful but more hurtful and evil at the same time. That story can be good but not great. With the sprinkle of imagination of tiger, zebra, and orangutan, 'Life of Pi' finds the perfect balance between the two.Cinematography: Genius work of art. God created Earth, light, water, sky, plants, living creatures, and humans. Ang Lee beautifies all the gifts from Him in similar order God created the world. I have appreciated harmony and art created together by nature, animal, and humans. Magical, marvelous, enchanting.... I cannot praise pictures and visual arts enough with any word I know. Especially, the scene where a shoal of flying fish appears and the tiger catches tuna is groundbreaking. Lee changes the frame ratio several times to create 3D effect and to subtly hint that tiger's point of view is the same one as that of Pi. SUCH a genius move. The use of noctilucence to create mysterious and even godly ambiance is clever as well.Messages: Pi's story is indeed the story in which one can find God's presence. Lee communicates that the creator of the world and the absolute goodness exists (whoever that God may be, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, or other) to audience without preaching. 'Life of Pi' is such a consolation for me. Life does not necessarily give out candy every single time. I see vice, become the victim of evil, and even act evil sometimes. It happens, but it all depends on how I take on. Also, I can always come back to good side and heal the wound as much as I can. As Pi effortlessly tries to survive, I have to keep paddling, never losing hope among all the difficulties.","

"areatw","6 December 2017","'Life of Pi' is without doubt one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the decade. It is visually mesmerizing, so rich in detail and jawdroppingly realistic. I regret not seeing it at the cinema when it was first released because I think films as visually arresting as this one really need to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.There's more to this film than just CGI and special effects though. The story is just as beautiful as the visuals are and, unlike some of the other CGI heavy films of recent years, it has a plot with substance and characters with depth. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will no doubt watch it again at some point in the future.'Life of Pi' is a beautiful film both inside and out. Cinema doesn't get much better than this.","

"kechhh","11 April 2013","I thought the storytelling and narrative were great. I loved how things were told in the past tense. The acting was also great.One part, obviously, which stood out completely was the CG effects. This movie was beautiful, and everything looked incredible. The waves, the water, the colors, the animals, the scenes, looked stunning.Despite these great parts, the movie fell short of the great potential it could have had. Though touting that the movie would make you believe in god, I found nothing in it doing so. While he did touch upon the idea of ""choosing what we want to believe"", I feel the idea was undeveloped. He could have developed a strong overarching universal message about life or choice, but he failed to pull through. The movie definitely set the stage and enabled him to do so if he really tried. Despite this, there really was no clear universal or moral message - it was way too ambiguous. For this reason, while this movie was good, it could have been even greater.","

"sidin","24 November 2012","When I read the book, I understood why Life of Pi was pronounced unfilmable. Most of the plot revolves around a boy and a tiger on a boat. This is one of those cases where most would say ""nothing happens"". This story which isn't blatantly cinematic didn't exactly have a formula for a great film. Its production was also jinxed as it changed directors from M. Night Shyamalan to Jean Pierre-Jeunet, an Indian-American and a Frenchman. These choices made sense since the book was written by a French-Canadian but set in the Indian backdrop. Finally, the job was handed over to Ang Lee who is neither French nor Indian. This told me how judgments could really throw you off sometimes and prevent you from discovering beauty. Lee takes on this crouching tiger and truly gives us a hidden dragon. He has always been expert at subtle drama and handling unspoken/ unfulfilled relationships with poignancy. It all ultimately fits. I would even go as far as saying the book was waiting to be filmed by him. Nobody else could have made it.Visually, the film is unlike anything your eyes have seen before. It is just utterly magnificent. Avatar, Hugo, Tintin and now Life of Pi. Few films have exhibited actual use 3D and not thanklessly indulge in shoddy gimmickry. The images composed are so strikingly rich and alive that it would work even without 3D. There would be at least 10 instances where my mouth opened and I couldn't bring myself to let out a gasp since I was choked with amazement.As most fables do, they transport you into a fantastical world while being an allegory on life. I personally love the character of Pi. He is relentless, a child of god who never ceases to give up hope. There is another character you take home with you: Richard Parker, the Royal Bengal Tiger. He isn't a cute dog that everybody in the audience falls for but a fearsome presence like King Kong. There are other wondrous creatures like a bioluminescent whale, an island swarming with meerkats and flying dorados. Magic realism on film has never been this good.Suraj Sharma is soulful as Pi. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes onto become a Hollywood movie star like Freida Pinto. Although, the performance that blew me away was that of Irrfan Khan as the older Pi. In the scene where he talks about Richard Parker, two teardrops from his eyes moved me ever so deeply. The film will be getting several nominations at the Oscars, including the big ones. But if there is any justice in Hollywood (which there isn't, as we know), Irrfan Khan should be on his way to getting an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.Mychael Danna's music is simply unbelievable. He uses Indian flutes, French accordions along with classical western violins. Pi's Lullaby (in Tamil) is achingly beautiful and it is accompanied with a gorgeous credits sequence that will make A. R. Rahman sit up with envy.I was a bit concerned about a few sub-plots in the novel and especially the preface which deals with Yann Martel talking about how he came to write this story. This preface is now a sub-plot in the film as Pi gives the story to the writer and tells him to do whatever he wants with it. That writer is Ang Lee who has taken Martel's story and improved upon it. He squeezes out certain moments from the source material and gives it a new life. The ending of the film is classic Ang Lee and stands tall as one of his best closing moments alongside Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Lust, Caution (2007). It is safe to say he is one of those few filmmakers who can film any story of any genre and still make it better than the genre's luminaries. He is one of cinema's modern masters.The question everybody will come out with after watching the film is whether it was real or not? I don't wish to go into this at all as I wholeheartedly believe Pi's tale without a single speck of doubt (I find it easier to believe than many films based on true stories). It isn't exactly believable how Sense and Sensibility, a Jane Austen novel that was fundamentally British was also perfectly filmed, not by a Briton, but by a Taiwanese filmmaker. It may seem far-fetched but it's the truth. Truth cannot be truth if it only comes out of knowledge and not experience. Life of Pi is that transcendental experience. There are many who will have issues with the film's thematic elements. Believe in god or not, but if you believe in cinema, you will surely be blessed with a gift. The word I would use to concisely describe Life of Pi is: ""beautiful"". This is most definitely one of my most favorite films of the year.","

"bevanmortimer","31 January 2013","Life of Pi is one of those films that almost immediately draws you in to the world it has created. I watched the film with a permanent smile on my face and surely that is all you can ask of any film! OK, so we all know the film is about a young man who is cast adrift with a tiger in the Pacific ocean in a small life boat. But, inevitably the story is so much more than that. Told largely in flashback, questions of faith and the human spirit are asked and sometimes answered. Almost uniquely in the day of the big Hollywood blockbusters, the film allows its audience to draw their own conclusions and not to be preached at. I'm sure the film says different things to different people, showing that what you bring in to a film will determine what you take out of it. The cast are excellent, especially the various actors who play our hero Pi Patel through various stages of his life. The different actors are all engaging and make his character believable and likable.The visuals are stunning and some of the 3D adds to the story and doesn't totally detract from it. I'm not a fan of 3D and this is the highest compliment I can pay to any 3D film. But, I think the visuals would be stunning in 2D. To be honest, I wish 3D would go away as it doesn't add very much and is a novelty at best. But, to be fair to director Ang Lee, he used it pretty well.I haven't read the book on which this film is based, so I can't say how true to the book the film is. But, the highest compliment I can pay to the film is it made me want to read the book.All in all a great film that I can highly recommend.","

"anirudhjaura","25 November 2012","I often try to use the movie name or something about it as part of my blog title. However, nothing short of 'spell-binding' does justice to this one. Ang Lee brings to life practically the impossible – a supposedly unfilmable book is presented in a manner that is a treat for the senses making Life of Pi a must-watch all the way!! Life of Pi starts off slow and after a time you begin wondering where's all the water, animals and action you saw in the trailer - but patience bears fruit. Once the adventure begins you are completely swept away and by the time the film reaches its abrupt intermission (since there's really no intermission in a Hollywood movie) you are well entrenched in the adventure and in no mood for a break. There's a lot of talk about the 3D of Life of Pi being better than Avatar. I'd just say that Life of Pi is presented in 3D in an Avatar of its own, the kind that perfectly suits the story that is told. The 3D isn't as extravagant, but peaks up at exactly the right moments and some scenes are sure to give you the thrills you would seek from a 3D movie. Clearly some lessons for all and sundry on how to use 3D in a movie However, while its a visual spectacle, Life of Pi is a real winner more because of the kind of depth its storyline offers. On the face of it, its an adventure, a tale of courage, hope and survival all very well but peel the layers and you find profound depth and meaning to everything you've witnessed in an entirely different light. I myself believe that I have only scratched the surface of what Life of Pi has to offer apart from its visual treat and best of all the director doesn't push you to think in any given direction. Its for you to think, explore and ponder or not The performances are top notch too, Suraj Sharma the protagonist does a decent job and pulls off a difficult role. The treatment to his character and his visual appearance is thoughtful and consistent, making his unbelievable story come to life. Irrfan Khan delivers yet again and though his initial accent is a little unbecoming, his emotional delivery later in the movie takes the cake. So does Adil Hussain impress with his impeccable accent and delivery in the earlier part of the movie. The only one wasted, is Tabu who given her range of performance is given a rather simple and short role The real star of the show is however, Ang Lee – first for believing that such a movie was possible and secondly for presenting it so wondrously - with scenes shot under and over water, at close quarters with a royal Bengal tiger and a host of other superb sequences. After one has almost given up here comes a real winner. One should never lose hope..so is the case with God, and Hollywood too I guess ;)To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com","

"Pedro_H","2 January 2014","Told in the style of a story-within-a-story (very Heart of Darkness, the original novel) a middle aged man tells two stories (to a visiting journalist) of how he - as a teenager - survived a shipwreck thanks to a lifeboat. But which does the listener believe? The standard version or a very bizarre version involving circus animals? In the ""bizarre"" a boy (Suraj Sharma) is set adrift on a lifeboat with only a wild tiger for proper company. The tiger being part of a zoo being transported to Canada. The tale of how they get along and/or both survive takes over most of the rest of the film.What an unlikely premise for a film this is! I came to it with an open mind and left it with a bit of an open mind too. Lots of thrills and spills and the usual special effects wham-bams which modern cinema has to offer (I didn't see it in 3D) but I am not sure what this was supposed to be about (other than basic survival) or why it needed to be structured the way it was.The set-up is simply tedious and since the production seemed to want to shout its central novelty from the rooftops it became a bit of a wrist glancer as it worked its way towards this - inevitable - central novelty. Either we get to know the people well (think The Deer Hunter) or don't bother at all. I mean Gérard Depardieu in a cameo role? For what purpose? The central character is mad as a bat anyway. He goes out on deck in a storm with nothing on but a shirt. Do you know how cold it is in the middle of an ocean? He dances about as the cross waves crash over him. Oh what fun it is to have ice cold waves crash over you! Laugh a minute.Given there is little else to see or talk about (and I don't want to start spoilers) how does a wild tiger (who only feeds on land anyway) catch anything from a boat. And how much fresh water does it need a day. Apart from lots? Not very realistic to nature is it? Like War and Peace is something about Russia this is something about religion. I suppose people who escape disaster tend to believe in God more than those who don't. Might just be luck though.The good thing is that I found it generally entertaining. And Shama is solid, although he doesn't have to do much other than be thrown around in front of a green screen. Would be very tedious to watch twice (apart from seeing in its intended 3D on a big screen) and that is the best acid test of a good movie.","

"Quietb-1","21 November 2012","Ang Lee makes good looking movies. Here again, he is meticulous in his craft and it shows on the screen.The problem with the Life of Pi is it starts too soon and ends too late. Because it is a story in flash back you know PI survives. If you have seen a trailer you know the movie should start with a great ship wreck scene. It takes to long to get there. End after the rescue. That interesting shaggy dog story from the hospital bed that was heard, not seen, was not needed and not cinematic. The movie looks and sounds good but it is redundant. How many storms at sea are enough? The movie might have trouble finding an audience. It looks like a family movie, but it is too violent and intense for younger children. If you go to see it, take your lead from the tiger. When the tiger leaves, you should too.","

"inkblot11","17 April 2013","Pi (Suraj Sharma as a teen, Irrpan Khan as an adult), has quite a story to tell a Canadian writer (Rafe Spall) when he comes calling. As it were, Pi was named after the longer word for swimming pool, Piscine, in French but an obvious, objective nickname became the norm until he demanded to be called Pi. His father and mother ran a small zoo in their Indian city and loved swimming pools, too. Pi got in dreadful trouble one day when he attempted to feed a Bengal tiger through skimpy bars. His father and mother made him watch the animal, named Richard Parker, long story, kill and eat a goat, as a lesson. Pi understood quickly the power of this beast. Later, due to financial difficulties, the family decided to move to Canada, where they would sell the remaining animals, including RP. Alas, on the boat, where the cook (Gerard Depardieu) belittled their vegetarian needs, a storm arose. A Japanese vessel, everyone sunk except Pi, Richard P, a zebra, a hyena and a monkey. These five managed to make a lifeboat, but because of the laws of nature, soon the only ones left were Pi and the tiger. For awhile, Pi hooked up a few life rings, by rope, to the small boat, whenever Richard Parker didn't get enough to eat and was on the prowl. Miraculously, this went on for weeks but when would they be rescued? Would they be? Bravo, dear Ang Lee, for making a film out of a complex novel, albeit a great one. There is much talk of religion and other philosophical matters in the book, as the story unfolds, and a great deal of this is captured. The first part, where the family life in India appears, is lovely, with great scenery and acting. Once on the waters, too, the imagery is likewise fantastic, as the story turns to the fight for survival. There are also flashbacks to the present, where the older, married Pi tries to elaborate any peculiar details. The acting is also wonderful, with no familiar stars except Monsieur D, in a rather small role, but no matter. All are compelling. The varied direction is enchanting, with its use of cutting techniques to keep the viewers involved in the action. Alas, I chose not to see this in 3-D at the theater, what a mistake of the decade! But, even on a small screen with no bells and whistles, this is an enthralling piece of cinema.","

"DJRMewzique","23 November 2012","First and foremost, I'd like to set the record straight. If you're one of those people who think ""Life of Pi"" is pretty much just a movie about a dude in a boat with a tiger, well, I have news for you......you're right.Ang Lee's latest feature, an adaptation of the book by Yann Martel which, after numerous attempts by other directors including M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Curon and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was deemed ""unfilmable,"" is indeed the story of a shipwrecked boy who survives for weeks on a lifeboat he shares with a Bengali tiger. As told to a reporter (Rafe Spall) by an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) from his Montreal home (Canada REPRESENT!), the story starts off with Pi's childhood and religious awakening before spending much time at sea...on a boat...with a big cat.Religion is the overpowering theme of the film, there is no doubt, but not in a preachy sort of way. Rather than being some sort of moralistic tale, the point I believe the narrative is trying to make is that personal spirituality is important, no matter what you may believe, and we should all just respect each other's points of view. And although I am a non-believer, that is something I cannot fault. If only, right? When a young Pi finds an interest in Christianity after having been raised Hindu and discovering the Muslim religion, his father brilliantly exclaims ""I'd rather you believe in something I do not agree with than accept all religions blindly."" Excuse me if I am paraphrasing slightly there, but the line was very powerful and one I can respect a great deal.However, despite the lovely religious equilibrium and the cute ferocious animal, ""Life of Pi"" never quite managed to enrapture me. The filming style, with its cuts and edits, came across almost amateurish and TV_movie-like while I found the script slightly underwhelming and the performances merely acceptable. Nothing more.But who am I kidding...I did not see the movie for the story. What intrigued me about the film was the talk of the visual effects. THAT is what I went for. Having been heralded as the most visually captivating film since ""Avatar,"" I was full of anticipation for this film for that reason and that reason only.And it is indeed a beautiful movie to watch on the largest screen possible. Definitely in 3D. The scenes are so incredibly drawn and meticulously brought to 3D life, you will almost forget what is going on in the film at times because you're busy staring too long at the CGI tiger going ""wow, how did they do that?"" Don't worry, it's not like you'll miss an important plot point. And you will find yourself asking that exact question many times during this film. However, it is no ""Avatar,"" which remains the most visually magnificent film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing (although I am sure many of you will see elements which have been borrowed from it at certain moments). To be honest, I didn't even find it as visually captivating as ""Cloud Atlas,"" as the beauty of the images hinder rather than help the audience personally connect with a story which seems a tad bit far-fetched as it is.No doubt Lee, a two-time Oscar nominee for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" for which he won, will undoubtedly get an invitation back to the ceremonies this year for his visual epic, but it's best chances at gold will be strictly technical, as the film itself leaves one a little underwhelmed. That time you spent the night with someone astonishingly beautiful but not terribly interesting? Yeah, kinda like that.","

"kunalkhandwala","12 December 2012","For years, a best-selling novel was deemed to be non-filmable due to its sheer scale of fantasy involving a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck. Until a visionary film-maker adapted every element and enriched it with today's latest computer-generated imagery to give us yet another masterpiece. In what could be one of the best adaptations of a fantasy novel, director Ang Lee celebrates with the modernity of cinema to tell a compelling tale that captivates one's imagination. Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi' is brilliantly visualized while maintaining a powerful narrative in spiritual and emotional harmony. The writer (Rafe Spall) meets Piscine Patel (Irrfan Khan) in the charming backdrop of Pondicherry where he inquires about Piscine's origins. In a most natural manner, Khan narrates his childhood and upbringing, including the origins of his eccentric name, how it evolved to 'Pi', his religious explorations and his father's principles. ]The writer then inquires about the most interesting part of Pi's life. In the tumultuous period of emergency that was declared in India, Pi's father decides to move to Canada while selling off all their animals from the zoo they managed.They set sail on the Tsimtsum with its kind Buddhist sailor and brash cook. Woken by a thunderstorm, Pi's initial enthusiasm about it is soon turned into a nightmare as the ship begins to capsize and he is left stranded on a boat, watching the vessel take his family down into the ocean with it. Pi has no time to react to such tragedy in the storm as soon enough, he realizes that he isn't alone on the lifeboat. While the Hyena kills off the zebra and orangutan, the Tiger named Richard Parker (clerical error at the Zoo) overcomes the vile creature and becomes the King of the boat. Pi's struggle to survive off the boat, safely distant from Richard Parker poses emotional, logistical and mental challenges. Below that surface level though, we witness Pi's determination to get rescued, his will to keep the tiger alive to give purpose to his own existence and his mental strength that made him resourceful in every circumstance. Spiritually, Pi suffers it all and through hunger, pain, fear, dejection and eventually determination, he sees the work of God in everything around him. Yet, Ang Lee's version does not dive deep into the spiritual realm. Nor does it portray the extreme harshness of being stranded in the middle of the Pacific ocean. The film's strength is in its tender moments of silence between Pi and Richard Parker as they witness the different tides together. Ang Lee chose to overpower the viewer by immersing into the sea of visual artistry rather than have a debate over God and food on a boat; And it worked.Ang Lee has most effectively used three elements to dazzle the viewer. Water, light and life. Never before has the ocean looked so daunting, rough, dark, transparent and serene, all in one movie. Through Pi's rigorous struggle to survive storms, we witness the ocean take on a ferocious form which is captured in a spectacular manner by Claudio Miranda. Then we witness the beautiful marine life in tranquil waters that are phosphorescent (the whale shot was phenomenal) and the serene waters when the Tiger and Pi are simply staring into the depths of the ocean. Then of course, the CGI of the animals and especially that of the Bengal Tiger. Someone would have to tell you that it wasn't real. That's how good the CGI work on Richard Parker was and every expression, reaction and movement was very real-like. A refinement that we had last witnessed in 'The Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. The hyena, the millions of meerkats on the carnivorous island and the flying fish were equally stunning creations. In the midst of all this, there were some beautiful 3D elements that were dancing and moving on the screen which gave us a sense of 'Avatar'. Overall, the film is a must watch in 3D because there is just so much creativity that sets a benchmark for future productions that indulge in fantasies. Irrfan Khan is just splendid. His narrative comes so naturally as though it was his personal story. The narrative is so finely balanced between fact and allegory and Khan never gives you a chance to choose one over the other, thus leaving an Inception kind of ending to ponder over. Adil Hussain was impressive as Pi's father with a versatile performance whereas Tabu did not have a role that would challenge her by any means. Andrea Di Stefano as the priest who introduces Pi to the son of God was remarkable in a cameo. But the film is heavily dependent on Suraj Sharma to carry the various emotions that a survivor of a shipwreck would have to exhibit in various circumstances at sea. Suraj easily relates to Pi's trauma upon being stranded, his desperation to live, his fear of the Tiger, his anger with the Tiger, his determination to survive, his despair at losing hope and his regaining of hope. His is one of the finest debut performances we have seen in a very long time and the credit goes to Ang Lee and David Magee's screenplay for extracting such brilliance from him.""Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed,"" Pi tells himself, ""but with God's will he can be trained."" Ang Lee refrains from being preachy about Pi's religious sentiments in a storm or in solitude. Instead, he highlights the face of humanity in adversity. He touches upon various religions but the importance of having one is seldom the focus. The older Pi may have narrated the story of him and the Tiger to the writer to make him believe in God but the audience is never driven to it. Spirituality lingers in the background, never being direct. Perhaps that subtlety is the reason Life of Pi is such a universally enjoyable film. 8.85 on a scale of 1-10.","

"seaview1","11 March 2013","Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible. He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe. It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father. The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship. During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker. An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast. As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies. When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience. He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character. Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion. His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story. He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, ""Do animals have souls?"" In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul. Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.There are unanswered questions. What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth? Is there a more plausible explanation? Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear. Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life. And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful.","

"rubenm","19 January 2013","Stunning. That's the only appropriate word to describe this film. Almost every minute, Ang Lee has some visual treat in store that makes you wonder: how did he do it? Already during the opening credits, with paradise-like scenes from a zoo, you know that this film is going to be a feast of spectacular images. It's not just the scenes with the boy and the tiger on the lifeboat. That in itself is a marvelous accomplishment for a film maker. But it's so much more. The way Lee uses visual effects makes this film a sort of cinematographic fairytale. Everything is colourful, bright, beautiful and a bit unreal. Of course, we know how Ang Lee did it: with computers. But the fact that a lot of what you see is computer generated, doesn't make it less impressive. Lee is able to tell a story with computer generated images that can make the audience laugh, shiver, an perhaps even cry. At the end of the film, the audience understands how Pi feels about the tiger. And that's not because of the special effects, but because of the way Lee has told the story. You could argue that it's just that: a sort of fairytale. There's no deeper meaning, no link to the real world. 'Life of Pi' is a visual showcase, not a gripping realistic drama. But that didn't bother me. I was awed by what I saw. Perhaps the film could have been more focused. The references to religion ('thank you Vishnu, for letting me know Jesus') are a bit out of place. I suppose the philosophical and religious aspects of the story are much more elaborated in the book than in the film. Also, the visit to the floating island with the meerkats could just as well have been left out, because it isn't really necessary for the story. That was the only part of the film I thought was a bit overdone. But then again, without it we would have missed some spectacular visual effects. And that's what it's all about in this film.","

"Junreviews","16 December 2012","The title of this review may seem offensive to some people, especially those who exceptionally enjoy the marvelous and emotional performance by Tom Hanks. As much as my affinity towards ""Cast away"" still vividly remains in my memory after 12 years, I can honestly say ""Life of Pie"", based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel is impressive in terms of both staging and acting.The plot is simply about a French-Indian boy, Pie, encounters a life-threatening shipwreck during immigration to Canada with his family and a herd of Family-run Zoo animals caged in the Japanese cargo ship to start a new life. However, the main story focuses on Pie and the tiger, aka Richard Parker, trying to survive after being stranded in middle of the ocean. The two who consider each other as enemies developing a heartwarming friendship by going through all sorts of conflicts with hand-to-mouth supplements on the rescue boat is what makes this movie adventurous and distinguished. The Visual effects consists of computer generated animals that interact with people. The magnificent underwater scene amuses me with a detailed presentation along with a giant wave where tremendous storm devours the ship. The most amazing part of the movie is to be able to witness the surreal CG tiger who steals the thunder of other animals using its fierce eye and charisma.On top of that, a young and novice actor, Suraj Sharma should get nominated for an Award for his incredible performance. Despite there are hardly anyone around him while shooting due to the large amount of CG used in the movie, he executes his role without being awkward. Endeavoring to engage with imaginary CG animals and trying to stay focused while being surrounded by the sea hazards must be as challenging as what Tom Hanks did in ""Cast away."" I can see a bright future ahead of him.Overall, this is an emotional and inspiring film for everyone who loves watching the nature and survival stories. One flaw of this movie would be a slow-paced storytelling. Things that transpire in the beginning is partially incoherent. However, that does not negate the fact that this is worth watching as it also contains a lot of hidden messages that are worth learning.","

"capone666","14 March 2013","The best thing about being on a lifeboat with a tiger is that by the end you'll have an amazing Vegas magic act. Surprisingly, the survivor in this drama isn't practicing prestidigitation with his feral shipmate. Pi (Irrfan Khan) recants for a writer his time on a dinghy with a menagerie. Sailing with family (Tabu, Adil Hussain, Ayan Khan) from India to Winnipeg, Pi is set adrift on the Pacific Ocean with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.Each animal finds its fate until only Pi and Richard remain. Forced to live in close confines, Pi must tame the tiger if he hopes to survive.Based on the bestseller, Life of Pi is a multifaceted and compelling half-truth told with superlative F/X and innocuous spiritualism.Incidentally, if Pi only knew the invigorating potency of crushed tiger bones, he could've speed rowed to shore.

"lordjord96","5 January 2013","Wow. Simply, Wow. 'Life of Pi' is on of those films which will always stay at the front of your mind. Every scene is so beautifully done, every theme so well interwoven. This film is exactly what I was looking for and more.The cast (albeit small) performed brilliantly. About a third of the film has more than 3 characters involved in it, while the rest is really just 2 (if you count the tiger as a character). The acting in those solitary scenes out at sea are done brilliantly. You really feel an emotional attachment to both Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's rather humorous name). Every struggle between them makes you feel scared, every pain makes you feel for them. I have never left the cinema missing every character as much as I did with Life of Pi (OK, maybe spirited away was just as heart-tugging).The plot is very well strung together. Ang Lee has tied in the themes of the book absolutely superbly. What annoys me about some films is that if they do have a meaning they try to hide it, but Life of Pi really doesn't. The meaning is related clearly to discovering God, and how we are really more animal-like than we think (it turns out the story with animals is more human than the story with humans). What also amazes me is how Ang Lee managed to put in sequences which served no purpose to the plot, just there to be purely beautiful, and get away with it! Many films annoy me when they include visually-superb sequences because they detract from the feeling of the film too much, but not this one. The fact that the entire film just looks SO GOOD means that these scenes ,made just to look good, really work. I saw this film in 3D and, despite my hatred of 3D (no film has really justified the price increase), Life of Pi actually looked great in 3D. Every scene had noticeable 3D in it. Whether this was just going further into the screen or, in many cases surprisingly, popping out of the screen, it really did work.So, #Life of Pi', is it the best film of 2012? No, but then again if it was then there must be something wrong with the world. I say that because this films' meaning is just so brilliant, so emotionally spectacular, that it just cannot be considered to be a film like any other. I actually feel bad about ranking it out of 10, but obviously I have to keep track of it somehow. Really, I would rank it as 'Pure Emotional Brilliance/10', but I'm afraid my IMDb vow prevents me from doing that. 'Life of Pi' offers a superb character ensemble, visuals which , dare I say rival those in 'Prometheus', and a plot so emotional, so perfect that it truly deserves it's 9.5/10 rating.P.S; I miss Richard Parker","

The 3d animations were extraordinary and it was just as I had imagined when I read the book. It was very realistic and the scenes were calming to the mind.The actors, where do I begin? Amazing just like how I remember them acting like in the book. I never really cry in films, but I did in this one. Very touching, very realistic and very exciting.I don't remember blinking or breathing at times threw the film. It's an exciting adventure that takes you threw the journey in the eyes of Pi Patel.

"jboothmillard","20 January 2013","From Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain), I saw the trailer and reviews for this film, most said it was a films that you had to see in 3D, so I went to see it in the hope it would be worth it. Basically, a Writer (Rafe Spall, Timothy's son) has been told that immigrant Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Irrfan Khan) from Pondicherry, India, now living in Montreal, Canada, has an amazing story to tell, and he is keen to hear it for his next book, and it starts by explaining that he was named after a swimming pool, Piscine Molitar, his first name being pronounced ""pissing"", so he changed it to Pi, like the maths term. In flashback, we see his family owned a zoo, five year old Pi (Gautam Belur) gained an interest in animals, especially Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger named due to a clerical error, he even puts himself in danger trying to feed it, his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) forcing him to watch it kill a goat to show its carnivorous nature. Twelve year old Pi (Ayush Tandon) is raised Hindu and vegetarian, but he finds interest in the Christian and Islam religions as well, he follows all three at once, and later in life he would lecture in Kabbalah at university. Aged sixteen Pi (Orange Rising Star Award nominated Suraj Sharma) is devastated when the family closing the zoo to move to Canada, meaning the animals will be sold, so they all board a Japanese freighter called Tsimtsum, with a rude cook (Gérard Depardieu) on board. One night the ship encounters a heavy storm, causing it to sink, Pi tries to find his family, but he is thrown into a lifeboat by the crew, all he can do is watch the ship go down with the crew and his family drowning. Alone in the middle of the ocean he is joined by an injured zebra and an orangutan, but he gets a shock from a spotted hyena who jumps out and kills the zebra and mortally wounds the orangutan, but the real shock is Richard Parker jumping out and killing the hyena. To keep himself safe from the tiger Pi finds food rations and builds himself a smaller raft to float a safe distance next to the lifeboat, and he feeds the tiger caught fish to protect himself from the animal, and he collects rain water for both of them to drink, and he shows compassion putting a ladder on the lifeboat to help the tiger out of the ocean when it jumps in. One night a large whale comes out of the water, and it causes many of the supplies to disappear, and starving he can only eat raw fish, and he realises to survive he should be able to get in the boat with the tiger, so over time he trains Richard Parker to let him in, and he finds that helping the tiger is keeping him alive. Near the point of exhaustion and with hardly any strength the lifeboat drifts during the night onto a floating island with a forest, edible plants, fresh water pools and hundreds of meerkats, so Pi and the tiger can regain their strength, but time passes and water turns acidic killing the fish, and he finds the plants are carnivorous, so collecting supplies they leave the island. After a long time at the sea the lifeboat finally reaches land, the coast of Mexico, Pi crawls onto land and rests on the sand, and he sees tiger Richard Parker walking towards the jungle and briefly stopping, he expects it to look back and acknowledge him, but he eventually walks through and is never seen again, while Pi is rescued by people who take him to hospital, he weeps because of the tiger leaving him. In hospital the sinking of the freighter is causing concern for some insurance agents, and they want to hear the account from the only known survivor, he tells the story he has which they do not believe, so then he fabricates a tale that is less fantastic but believable that he was in the lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg, and the cook. In present day the Writer is asked by adult Pi which story he believes and prefers, he finds the parallels in the story that he concocted for the insurance guys, and he answers that he finds the story with the tiger much more incredible, 227 days at sea was a remarkable feat, and he is allowed to take this story to use for a novel. Also starring Tabu as Gita Patel, Andrea Di Stefano as the Priest and Shravanthi Sainath as Anandi. Newcomer Sharma gives a very endearing performance as the young man struggling against the odds to survive, computer animated tiger Richard Parker is a convincing character because he is so realistic looking, I completely agree that this has to be seen in 3D, for the appearance of the tiger, the exciting sequences with storms, whales and underwater moments, you could argue it is similar to Cast Away, but on a boat, and there should be a little more plot, but it has the moments of tension, you sympathise with the characters, and it really feels like a journey to watch, a great fun adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music, Original Score for Mychael Danna, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Song for ""Pi's Lullaby"", Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Music, Best Production Design, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

"gbacquet","5 January 2013","Amidst movies like The Hobbit, Jack Reacher and Skyfall, all packed with action, fighting, shooting, killing and breaking, comes ""Life of Pi"", from director Ang Lee, someone who brings a different kind of cinema to audiences.I should tell you that I'm a fan of Ang Lee's and he's only let me down once (Hulk, anyone?), but I went into this film with an open mind and ready for whatever came my way.""Life of Pi"" follows the life of Pi Patel from his very early childhood to his grown up years as he tells it to a writer interested in his unusual life story. We get a glimpse of Patel's life as a boy in India, his relationship with his parents, brother, God and.....animals. As a teenager and after surviving a shipwreck, Patel will experience loss, faith and the loss of it as well, but he will also develop a bond with a Bengal tiger that will change and shape him forever, and challenge everything he knew about life.Most of the movie is spent in showing this relationship and its effects in the leading character. Nothing can really prepare you for what's in store for you: I suggest you abandon any preconceptions you might have and simply enjoy the experience because as simple as it sounds, this story is absolutely surprising and there's no way to tell where it will go and how it will end.In fact, the characters in the movie didn't know it either and this helps your own disbelief.Additionally, the film is a visual feast. Unlike some other visually stunning films, however, the effects here are used to tell a story and to actually enhance it, not to dazzle the audience with outstanding visual effects. As beautiful as it is, the story is the most compelling part and though it might not be 100% original (we've seen movies of human befriending animals before), I guarantee you, as a movie junkie that I am, that you have never seen one like this; I think the fact that the protagonist is Indian and the director Taiwanese helps this film to be culturally and philosophically very different to what we're used to and this factor made the experience all the more rewarding. As a side note, this movie is ideal for families: the movie theater was full of kids and they all enjoyed it. There are no scary scenes, no brutality, no cursing: just life, with its share of sadness, love and happiness.I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best film of the year, but I can say for sure that you will not see another film that even slightly resembles this one in terms of story, visuals and life lessons. Go see it, you won't regret it.",NA
"aequus314","23 January 2013","First of all; Life of Pi has very little appeal for movie goers unfamiliar with Yann Martel's novel. They will have to glean from whatever information is available before deciding whether to watch it in the cinema or buy on DVD.Second; movie poster is a ""big heads in the sky over tiny people on the sea"" type, and it doesn't stand out among the ones with catchier designs.Third; it casts two virtual unknowns--fierce looking Bengal feline and plain looking Indian boy (newcomer, Suraj Sharma). Which means there will be no attractive Hollywood celebs to ogle at and no sex scenes to anticipate.Fourth; the movie tagline is cliché--""The Journey of a Lifetime."" It is so generic that it can easily apply to any movie off the top of my head: Castaway, Chronicles of Narnia, Titanic, Alexander, PathfinderLastly; the movie poster underplays two things that will most certainly sell the film, Ang Lee and 3D.**************************** But watch it anyway because Life of Pi is unlike any film Ang Lee (Taking Woodstock, Brokeback Mountain) has ever made, yet it is the most profoundly moving piece of cinema in his twenty years as a filmmaker. From the very beginning; lush evergreen and a mellow giraffe fade in before enchanting melody drifts across the airwaves--it instantly captivates, right until the very last frame. I would have liked to describe Life of Pi as a genteel; romantic cousin of Slumdog Millionaire but that would be off base. Both exude different energies. One is extroverted and dynamic, while the other is intuitive and intensely dramatic.Adapted from Yann Martel's 2001 novel, this film is a 3D adventure fantasy drama based on adapted screenplay by David Magee (Finding Neverland). In broad terms, it tells the story of a 16 year old boy named (after a swimming pool in Paris) Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel; and his journey as a shipwreck survivor, adrift on Marianas Trench--deepest part of the world's ocean.Story is told from one narrative viewpoint—an older, middle aged Piscine in a flashback as he recounts his 227 days ordeal stranded on the Pacific Ocean.He lives with his parents (they run a private zoo) and elder brother, Ravi. After an unforeseen land dispute, the family boards a Japanese ship in an attempt to sell their zoo animals around the world before settling as migrants in Canada. But a storm hits and passes; with his family gone, Pi finds himself stranded with a lifeboat and some animals. Hours turn into days; as he contemplates the difficult situation, thematic focus of this film unfolds. Separation, survival, self- discovery, the will to live, hunger and thirst, faith and belief all culminate in one of the most impeccably crafted bildungsroman I have ever seen.No one in recent years has improvised upon French Impressionism so spectacularly as cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Tron: Legacy, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) did in this film. We see a cloud filled sky blazing with azure before young, curious Pi plunges into the pool but imageries are never indulged for its own sake. Frame after frame; photography continues to fascinate by embodying important symbolic ideas and emotions of the story. Visual poetry in this film is mesmerizing, and I'll be damned if Miranda fails to bag an Oscar for it.There is a scene in the final act that brought me to snot dribbling tears. When Richard Parker stopped in his tracks at the edge of the jungle, right before he enters it. The fact that he has no human characteristics makes it poignant; the emotional impact came very suddenly, I wasn't at all prepared for it. cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",NA

"johnnyboyz","25 August 2019","Have you ever actually physically seen a tiger? I had the tremendous fortune to see one once, at a zoo, concealed behind what I presume was a fairly thick wall of glass. They are sprightly animals: expressive faces, strangely full of both confidence and apprehension; eyes which cut right through you when they stare you down. Their agility is quite striking, gracious, but of course deadly, in their hopping and pouncing to and from their chosen platforms. Between the open-air monkey enclosure; the penguin performance and the tarantula on one of the zoo keeper's arms, the tiger was certainly one of the highlights.Broadly speaking, the premise to ""Life of Pi"" is that someone, a teenager, is stuck on a small life raft with one of these beasts in the middle of the ocean. The tiger cannot eat the boy, otherwise it will starve, but of course it doesn't know this, and the boy, who is of course stranded, must fish for food to sustain both his own life but also to keep the tiger at bay. Ang Lee, directing, spins a nimble tale out this idea, borrowing, in terms of imagery and general approach, from some of the more successful films of this stock from recent years: ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Amélie"", for instance, while the sense of being stranded in one place and having to rely on resourcefulness calls to mind ""Cast Away"". You know the types I mean: slick, good looking and colourful dramas which glide along at their own pace. Fans of its genre will enjoy it, but there is a little bit more in there besides in terms of its exploring things to do with morality; evolution and where exactly God sits in the world.The film begins in the present-day, and so broadly speaking consists of one, long flashback, with the titular Pi, a man of Indian descent, in his Canadian home speaking to a struggling author (Rafe Spall). The author is looking for something with some spark to put down into a book, and he seems to think he's found it in the titular Pi, who experienced what can only be described as a unique experience in his younger life. We flash right the way back to India during Pi's youth, wherein his family runs, in actual fact, a zoo. But amidst all the animals on display, hypnotically put to us via the opening credits sequence, it is the tiger which attracts Pi's attention the most - beautiful but deadly, elegant in its movement and monitoring of its surroundings; fur like velvet you can only stroke when it is under anaesthetic.In a sense, much of what Pi encounters during this opening act in India has little to do with what the film will come to depict, in that he excels somewhat at mathematics at school; has difficulty communicating with girls and swims a bit, but it presents him as a human-being and a boy who, like any boy, has these experiences at school and home. At the zoo, his father forces him to watch the aforementioned tiger consume a goat when Pi becomes a little too enamoured with the creature, and this kills something inside of him he cannot quite define, although to what extent it had to do with anything later on is unclear. Perhaps his experience at sea was the catharsis he needed to rekindle his lost feelings, but it couldn't be as simple as that, could it?Lee moves the film into the second act with a dramatic shipwreck sequence when Pi's father feels the family set-up and all involved must move across the ocean to Canada; the going down of the liner and our perspective of it eerily, and I'm sure not wholly accidentally, calling to mind the earlier imagery of Pi's father swimming in the crystal-clear waters of a Parisian pool with the bright blue sky in the background. From here, the meat of the film unfolds as Pi and a scatter-shot crew of animals from varying points on the food-chain uneasily congregate on a lifeboat and are left to float on their own. The passage allows the film to mediate on a variety of things, but only via the perspective of a young boy who has happened to read up on the world's religion, but has also lost everything he had.Consequently, the film teases us with a Darwinian plight involving the animals which, unsurprisingly, goes the way of the fittest. There is a tantalising moment whereby an Orangutan, the closest to human-beings in an evolutionary sense, seems to realise it needs to put on a life-jacket. Pi confronts God via prayer when he is forced into terminating the life of a fish to survive, something which drags us back to the world of the Old Testament when people were forced into the barbarous action of slaughtering bovine animals in order to live before using God to justify it and writing it all down in Leviticus, a sort of apology to themselves. He then does so again via a means he at least thinks is more physical when a tropical storm strikes the boat and we are, again, reminded of how people in dire situations used to put their circumstance and the natural world around them down to a deity punishing and/or testing them.The film is all at once a disaster movie; a comedy; a biography and a rumination on life and the world, but it is never enough of any one of these things to have it feel contained or constricted to the generic demands of either of these things. Instead, ""Life of Pi"" is a refreshing and often exhilarating drama with a bite as powerful as any wild cat's.",NA
"davidmvining","26 November 2019","Let's get this out of the way: This movie is beautiful to look at. That's not nothing, but it's far from the movie's sole strength. Performances from human and animated creature alike are very good, but it's the interplay of the central story and the framing device that engages me the most.A novelist visits a middle-aged Indian-Canadian at the advice of the Indian's uncle. Pi, a nickname stemming from his full name of Piscine, the French word for swimming pool, lives a small and quiet life but lived an experience that, he says, will convince the novelist of the existence of God. That's no small feat.Pi's family owned and operated a zoo in India until it became financially untenable. Pi's father determined that they would move to India, transport the animals with them on the ship, and sell them in Canada. On the trip, the ship sinks for never explained reasons and Pi finds himself alone on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena, and a zebra. The zebra dies due to a leg injury, the hyena kills the orangutan, and as the hyena is about to lunge at Pi, a tiger, Richard Parker, leaps out from the covered half of the boat and kills the hyena. Pi uses his wits to establish a raft roped to the end of the lifeboat where he can rest without fear of the tiger getting to him.Through adversity, the two learn how to live together. Pi figures out how to net fish large enough for Richard Parker to eat. They survive a large storm together. They find a mysterious island populated with roots that Pi can eat and meerkats that Richard Parker can feast on. This island is an oasis in the middle of the ocean. They can live forever on its fruits, but Pi discovers a human tooth in one of the island's flowers at the same time he sees the pool of fresh water fill with dead fish as it turns to acid. He sees this temporal haven as toxic. He packs up his supplies, gets Richard Parker back on the boat (who seemed to understand the island's dangers before Pi did), and they leave.I think one of the wonderful things about this narrative is how the novelist finds the metaphor in the story and spells it out. It's the sort of easy metaphor that audiences love because it doesn't require a whole lot of thought and can be easily discerned. The novelist saying, ""the hyena was the cook, the orangutan was your mother, the zebra was the sailor, and Richard Parker was you"" is a great way to cut through the obviousness of the metaphor while also lifting the narrative to be about more than a simple series of symbols. The narrative at the core of the film, the time on the lifeboat, is all about survival. It's pretty straightforward, but Pi had promised a narrative that would convince his audience of the existence of God. A thin metaphor of a story about a boy who survives on the ocean isn't going to do it.What is meant to convince is the framing device itself. This comes out most forcefully in a scene after Pi gets rescued where he is interviewed by two representatives from the shipping company out of Japan. The rest of the story within the story had been bright and full of color. First there was India in all its visual splendor, then the bright blues of the ocean up against the bright orange of the tiger's fur. The interview is in a small white room with white sheets. It's a simple back and forth cut between Pi telling his story and a couple of reaction shots. It's so flat in comparison to the bright and colorful story we had gotten. It's also much more grounded as he tells was really happened. The sailor died of his wounds. The cook killed Pi's mother in a pique of rage. Pi killed the cook and then survived for 9 months on a lifeboat alone. There was no island, and he simply survived.""Which story do you like more?"" Pi asks the novelist. ""The one with the tiger,"" he replies.How is that supposed to make one believe in God? Well, Pi frames the belief in God as a choice. You can chose to believe in the mundane, or you can open yourself up to the grandeur of the unknowable. Life with a God in it is much more interesting and full of meaning than one without it. That concept is conveyed wonderfully by building on a simple story and imbuing it with real meaning.The movie is, of course, a wonder to behold, but it's also wonderful that it's got so much thematic and character driven depth.",NA
"the_grand_lebowski","2 December 2012","It is a rare opportunity to see a film in which every frame evokes miraculous imagery. So it is with Life of Pi: Director Ang Lee translated the bestselling novel by Yann Martel into one of the most visually arresting cinematic events of this year. Like a fever dream that occasionally transforms into a nightmare, before delivering you back into a state of nirvana, Life of Pi is at its best breathtaking, but also looms with a mysterious energy prepared to pounce when you become comfortable.The story of Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Suraj Sharma) unfolds through the narration of the elder Pi, who recounts his story for the benefit of a writer, in search of a story that will ""make him believe in God."" It is unlikely that Pi's engrossing story will have any effect on your religious inclinations, but it will certainly entertain. Pi's life is completely upended when a cargo ship carrying Pi and his family, as well as numerous animals from their zoo, is lost at sea. Being the sole human survivor, Pi is forced to contend with a troop of animals that also managed to seek refuge on his lifeboat. As the days pass, the group of four animals is cut down to a single animal: an adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The two survivors are faced with serious challenges on their journey across the ocean, and none is more terrifying than the close proximity they share. What develops is a volatile relationship that ultimately saves Pi's life.The entire weight of Life of Pi is balanced on newcomer Suraj Sharma's back. The true beauty of this film may be its cinematography, but considering how much of this movie focuses on a solitary human in a boat with a tiger, casting a weak actor in the role of Pi would have been as disastrous as flinging acetone on a painting. The range of emotions conveyed by Sharma makes it difficult to believe that he earned this role accidentally (He only attending the casting call to support his brother's audition, and ended up winning the role out of 3,000 actors.), and has no previous acting credits. If Life of Pi is any indication of what Sharma is capable of, we shall be seeing a great deal of this talented young man in the coming years.Life of Pi is substantial achievement in storytelling. The film covers a variety of topics: spirituality, mortality, maturity, death, and survival. The film is incredibly dense, and having little knowledge of the novel beforehand, I was not prepared for how intense a film this would be. The quality of trailers shown before the movie seemed to indicate that many might treat Pi as a children's film; it is most certainly not. While a story of a young man on a boat with a tiger might sound like the beginning of a children's fable, the substance of this film would be difficult for a child to stomach. Ang Lee has proved himself a master of stylized film and Life of Pi is possibly his most visually stunning motion picture to date. Life of Pi illustrates the ability of a story to captivate our imaginations, and attests to the wonderment of storytelling.http://flickermotion.blogspot.com/",NA
"georgep53","24 December 2012","Ang Lee's ""Life Of Pi"" is a remarkable film. Adapted from Yann Martel's book it tells a story of an idealistic young man who finds himself stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger after the ship carrying him and his family sinks in a storm. Like Ernest Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" it is an allegorical tale that wrestles with some of the most fundamental issues confronting mankind. Suraj Sharma is excellent as the titled character. Beginning life as ""Piscine Molitor"" he shortens his name to simply ""Pi"" after the other schoolchildren start referring to him as ""Pissing"". He frustrates his Hindu father by professing a belief in Christianity and Islam as well as Hinduism despite his father's protests that it is irrational to do so. When the father decides that their future financial prospects in India are not good the family packs up and sets sail for Canada and a new life. Following a catastrophic storm Pi is forced to reconcile his idealism with the primal desire for self-preservation. This is a gorgeous looking picture thanks to Claudio Miranda's cinematography and the 3D is outstanding. ""Life Of Pi"" is a triumph and one of the best films of 2012.",NA
"planet11","8 January 2013","It's the one of two best IMAX 3D movie I've ever seen(the other one is AVATAR). I really think IMAX should take a serious consideration to use this film's clip as the demo tape. Not to mention the various meaning behind this film the reviews here said it about 100 times. I found one of the interesting part of this film is too see how the 3D effect can be used in a drama movie to tell a story, not just for those special-effect-kind film. Plus the sound editing and mixing is also well above the standard and cinematography is a lock in many awards. Ang Lee is known to bring out the best from new actors ,Ziyi Zhang of CTHD,Wei Tang of Si Jie, and Suraj Sharma of this one. They all deliver award-winning performance in their first international big screen role.I plan to see it again in IMAX 3D while it's still showing there, and I highly recommended anyone go to feel the real power of IMAX 3D if you haven't done so.",NA
"leonblackwood","9 July 2013","Review: This is a visual spectacular, with a great storyline which touches the heart. The director used today's technology to the fullest to bring the movie to life. You really believe that the tiger, and other animals like the hyena and zebra, are really there, which makes the movie even more enjoyable. The leading character was a great choice and he also put n a convincing performance, which must have been hard with so much graphics being used. This is a bit weird to say, but the relationship between Pi and the tiger was brilliant. It reminded me a lot like Wilson and Tom Hanks in Castaway. Anyway, this movie should definitely not be missed because there won't be another movie with such a deep and meaningful storyline for some time. Brilliant!Round-Up: I did find the ending a bit corny, after going through such an emotional ride, but it doesn't take away the greatness in the film. Although the storyline is great, it's the visual effects that must have taken a hell of a long time because of its precise and believable realism. The whole shipwreck scene will put Titanic to shame, but in some ways, its not the type of movie that you will watch time and time again, for a some unknown reason. With all that aside, this movie must look excellent in 3D, which is the format that I recommend to everyone who watches this movie and check out the wicked names for the animals.Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $609million (Well Deserved!)I recommend this movie to people who like there emotional, fantasy/adventure movies with a touching storyline. 8/10",NA
"patsworld","29 December 2012","Just got back home from watching Life of Piand I am stunned! This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen – and I've seen a lot of them. The closest that comes to this picture was seeing Avatar in 3D. This movie will take your breath away. One the way home, we all played the, ""What was your favorite scene"" thingand this is giving nothing awaybut at one point this little boat is floating out in the middle of the ocean with the sky reflected on the water, the same brilliant colors above and below so you can hardly tell which is up and which is down. To say that it's beautiful doesn't come close to doing it justice. And that is only one scene that will leave you amazed. This picture has so many Oscar's in store for it that, frankly, the rest of the list should simply pack up and stay home. There was not one single word, not one single scene that should have been any different than what it was. And Suraj Sharma who is Pi Patel carries so much of this movie brilliantly, playing against nothing but the ocean and a tiger, that it's nothing short of amazing. Nobody should miss this film. It's one you will never forget!",NA
"octopusluke","20 December 2012","With its' poetic realism and sickly, spiritual subtext, Yann Martel's international bestselling novel Life of Pi was once declared unfilmable. Until now. Directed by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Ang Lee, even if the plot stinks; this beautiful adventure movie is an absolute must-see.Newcomer Suraj Sharma stars as Piscine Molitor Patel, aka Pi; a well-educated, wistful teenager growing up on the grounds of his family's zoo in Pondicherry, India. The curious son of liberal parentage, Pi is fascinated by the religions of the world, studying them in detail but undecided, what is the correct path for him. Finding the answer and his soul mate, his father declares that the family are broke and must relocate to Canada. Boarding a cargo ship with his family and the anaesthetised exotic animals resting in the hull underneath, their journey across the Pacific is disrupted by the perfect storm; sending the vessel plunging to the seabed. The only human survivor, orphaned Pi is left stranded aboard a lifeboat with a hysterical hyena, wounded zebra, benevolent orangutan and a Bengalese Tiger called Richard Parker.You don't have to be an ethologist to see that Pi's predicament would cause an infinite number of problems. Once the animals clash, our hero is left as the carnivorous Richard Parker's final prey. But through his resourcefulness and spirituality, Pi manages to survive the fatal claws of his feline shipmate and, over a period of 227 days, the pair end up forming a remarkable relationship, built on companionship, fear and the mutual hope that they will one day be rescued.Words cannot describe how stunning this movie is to look at. With the help of cinematographer Claudio Miranda and a committed special effects team, the Oscar-Winning filmmaker behind Brokeback Mountain and the ill-fated comic-book hero Hulk has directed the first ever 3-D Art film. A bottomless box of visual delights, colours have never been so vivid, landscapes so luscious or 3D so fantastic. Instead of distancing us from the action on-screen, causing light-loss and nausea, the once-dreaded stereoscopic glasses deepen our engagement with Pi & Parker's ordeal. An extraordinary quest where they encounter millions of flying fish skittering past them, phosphorescent jellyfish glowing underneath, a breaching whale gliding across the starry skyline and an island inhabited by 60,000 Meerkats.In his debut role, Sharma is fantastic as Pi, able to balance religious fervour, comical flourish and irrepressible charm, even if his supporting catty cast member was almost entirely a digital creation, blended into the live action seamlessly. It's incredibly refreshing to see the ironically named Richard Parker never anthropomorphized. He doesn't talk, nor even exist in the real world, yet his presence in Pi's is what saves him, and ultimately the film, from excessive ""is there a god?"" ruminations.Adapted by screenplay writer David Magee (Finding Neverland), the cinematic spectacle does it's best to cloak what is ostensibly a very corny plot, but elements of the baggy original novel still creep in. In typical Forest Gump style, most of the story unravels through recollection, with a present day Pi (played by Irrfan Khan), living in Montreal and narrating the tale to a curious Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). It's a telling-over-showing narrative compromise lifted directly from Martel's novel. A thorny branch that jolts the audience back into the mundane world we are all used to, and away from the wonderful realm where we'd rather be.Whilst my atheism was left unscathed, the rapturous aestheticism rekindled my passion for big blockbuser cinema. Life of Pi is a much-needed bit of heart-warming magic during this frosty festive season.Find more reviews at www.366movies.com",NA
"BeneCumb","26 February 2013","Although the movie has a nice balanced approach of visual and spiritual, the plot is still hectic and with too long scenes and repetitions - its duration of about 2 hours could have been avoided. Directing and camera work are, of course, excellent, and powerful nature (the sea, above all) and animals are catchy to follow, but this shipwreck story becomes a bit annoying soon (thanks to the tiger, not totally boring though). Moreover, the flashbacks and recollections could easily be shorter. And the ending, well... Just the joy of storytelling.As for actors, they are not so memorable, typical Bollywood, and Gerard Depardieu has too small part. Speaking of India-related movies, I would definitely prefer Slumdog Millionaire or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.",NA

"caseymoviemania","29 November 2012","Once deemed ""unfilmable"" by three directors (M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuaron and Jean-Pierre Jeunet) who came and exited the big-screen adaptation of Yann Martel's award-winning novel, LIFE OF PI, Taiwanese director Ang Lee takes up the challenge and he succeeds beautifully. LIFE OF PI is one of the year's most cinematic motion pictures ever seen -- it's visually stunning, emotionally gripping and thematically inspiring adventure drama that pushes (almost) all the right buttons.From the first moment itself, the movie is intoxicating enough to hold your attention. The way how director Ang Lee establishes a serenity, Zen-like tone with a variety shots of the animals in Pi's father's exotic zoo is truly a sight to behold. With the help of Claudio Miranda's lush cinematography and Mychael Danna's soothing score, the opening scene evokes the kind of popular nature documentaries you found in TV's Planet Earth. While the opening act is undeniably slow, it's also crucial that Lee takes his time to establish his characters and the tone before he gets to the main point. At the hand of a lesser director, such approach can be a test of patience but Lee and screenwriter David Magee knows how to endear the viewers to Pi's life story, which is told in such elegant and poignant manner. And like how interesting life story is meant to be told, there's a healthy dosage of gentle humors and heartbreaking moments that feel so vivid, yet involving enough to make you care. By the time the movie reaches midway, Lee hits full gear ahead, beginning with one of the most terrifying storm sequences ever seen in a long time and of course, the subsequent sequence where Pi has to survive with a bunch of animals in the lifeboat. Here, Lee has also delivered some of the most breathtaking visual spectacles ever created in a movie -- at times it feels magical and stunning. Among them are the night scene where Pi encounters a swarm of jellyfish illuminating under the ocean as well as a run-in with a giant whale, and of course the unlikely battle scene with a school of flying fish passing through.All the cast (mostly unknowns) are exceptionally top-notch. Newcomer Suraj Sharma is a real gem, and definitely a teen prodigy. Prior to this movie, he has no acting experience at all but thanks to his sheer determination and personal guidance by Lee himself, Sharma is very convincing as a teenager struggling against all odds while stranded in the middle of the ocean. Like Tom Hanks' magnificent one-man performance in 2000's CAST AWAY, there's the similar acting impact echoes within Sharma as well. No doubt he can handle both physically and emotionally-demanding scenes like a seasoned actor. Then there's Irrfan Khan, who plays adult Pi with such poignancy. The way he narrates his life story to the young writer is truly mesmerizing, as he captures the tone of a voice filled with enthusiasm and heartfelt emotions. What a remarkable storyteller, he is. Adil Hussain, in the meantime, is perfectly cast as Pi's strict father. Lastly of course, Richard Parker the Bengal tiger itself. You will have a hard time trying to differentiate between the real and fake tiger, thanks to the startlingly photorealistic CGI ever put in a movie. Not only that, Lee also successfully made that tiger a compelling character to watch for.LIFE OF PI is almost a pitch-perfect movie experience, but Lee stumbles a bit during the finale. The particular finale, especially where it concerns the aftermath of Pi's survival in the ocean, is unnecessarily overlong. That excessive fat aside, LIFE OF PI remains a must-see movie for everyone.",NA

I haven't felt that sort of magic in a movie theater in a long, long time.I read the book and liked it and the film may even improve upon it which is kind of a miracle considering it's kids, animals and water just about all the time. The spiritual themes are simple and deep and raise more questions about faith and belief than answer anything. No preaching going on here and there could be.

"uttiyo-sarkar56","7 February 2013","My Rating: 9/10Enchanting, Spiritual, Great Acting and with Incredible Visual effects, Life of Pi is an amazing story of survival and courage and is backed up with some amazing visual effects, great acting, superb background score and some brilliant presentation of a movie by Ang Lee who has made a perfect move from a novel which was labelled as one from which a movie cannot be made out of, and Lee Deserves a lot of applaud for his devotion and brilliant contribution to this movie.The Story which is based on the novel written by Yann Martel is about a young spiritual boy named Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) who is the boy of a zookeeper who lives in Pondicherry, but after some issues with their zoo in pondicherry, they decide to move to Canada and take the animals with them, but when they board the ship and after staying in it for sometime, it starts to sink and only Pi barely manages to survive in a boat along with a zebra, hyena, an orangotan and a Tiger named Richard Parker, and after the other animals kill themselves, it's only Pi and the Tiger who survive and Pi must find a way to tame Richard Parker and save himself from the gruel Pacific Ocean and somehow survive through this crises.Their are'nt many actors in this movie and the cast is quite small compared to most movies, but everyone has done their job's superbly, starting from Suraj Sharma who has portrayed the young Pi brilliantly and his acting throughout the crises time is amazing and he plays his character quite perfectly and has done a lot of good to his career with this. Irfan Khan also does brilliantly as the Present Pi who is grown up after that survival in the ocean and although much of his role is to narrate the story, he has done it superbly and its good to see the Indian Actors do well in this movie. Even Tabu( Pi's Mother) and Adil Hussain(Pi's Father) have done well to ensure that everyone in the cast has done extremely well with their roles. Last But Not the least the Tiger aka Richard Parker deserves a huge amount of credit and although i don't really know if its animated or not, but if its real then hats off to the trainer who trained him. Well, before this movie was released or was poised to release, there was a lot of talk of how the book cannot be depicted into a film, but Ang Lee has silenced those critics by making one of the most beautiful and visually thrilling movies of the past years which also consists of some great acting and some really brilliant presentation of survival and courage of Pi and Lee has done amazingly in all the aspects of the film starting from the cast(which is quite small and inexperienced) in which he has made Sharma act to his full potential, to the visual effects(for which although the visual effects team deserve the most credit) which are absolutely amazing and I really regret not watching this in the movie theatre, and the presentation of the movie is absolutely amazing starting from the first scene to the last, and the scene's of Pi and Richard Parker are absolutely amazing and visually enthralling. He Deserves the Best Director Oscar award this year and I'm Sure Life of Pi will get awards from many other categories as well.The Visual effects of this movie is one of the best visual effects i've seen in a movie and this movie was difficult to make mainly because of these quite impossible visual effects in the story, but it's perfectly shown by the visual effects team who have done an amazing job with the sequences after the ship sinks and this movie is bound to get many awards from the visual categories. The Cinematography In the Movie is also superb and the scene's shown of the pacific ocean are simply mind- blowing and the cinematographer Claudio Miranda has done a really brilliant job with the cinematography which also adds to the brilliant visual effects of the movie. The Screenplay of the movie written by David Magee is quite great and the dialogues are brilliantly delivered by the actors and the novel was quite brilliantly depicted in this movie with the help of the screenplay and Magee has done a great job with the screenplay of the movie. The Background music in each and every sequence is amazing and the survival scene's are really superbly backed up with the background score mainly consisting of Indian Instuments and the background music goes brilliantly with the visual effects of the movie which leave many awestruck throughout the movie and the Mychael Danna has done brilliantly with the background score of the movie.Well, I Really DO regret not watching this in the movie theatre and this probably has everything in it to please the audience and the visual effects and heart-warming story keeps one awestruck throughout the movie.",NA

This is the first of his films that I have watched. and I swear I will not see any more of his films in my lifetime.And that terrible accent. For those of you who don't know, its not how we Indians speak English. Seems Irfan had to imitate the young guys accent for the sake of creating the impression, that he was the grown up version of that awful guy in the boat. I wonder how can anyone relate to this horrible character. I just wished Richard Parker lunged at him and finished him off in a single strike. But the tiger is just as lame as the lead character.Usually Tigers show up well on screen. But they managed to undo that too. So we get a cartoonish Tiger.When you see the guy reading out some text on surviving sea wrecks, while riding a raft, having just lost his entire family. and the fact that the director has chosen to devote 10 minutes to all that crap, you know you are in for a nightmarish movie.The only question, the only emotion that the movie evoked in me was, how could anyone make such a movie, and how did it manage to make the money it made. I am ashamed of being a part of this population of 7+ billion, the majority of which found this movie worthy of praise.This movie and its story is so dumb, I need to make a few clarifications. Wish they had had the sense of consulting some experts before making a movie on religion and philosophy. The first thing is the vegetarian-turns-meateater sermon. For the record, there are vegetarians and non vegetarians residing peacefully and in harmony in India. But the people who are vegetarians don't try to turn the non-veggies into veggies. and vice versa. Now the point that the movie seems to make. That a boy stranded on a boat without food, abandons being a vegetarian and starts eating fish. Well, its OK for him, he is such a lousy character anyway. I don't mind seeing him eat fish. But you cant use such an example for making ur point. There are people who would rather die of hunger than eat fish. I am not talking about those celebrities who turn to vegetarianism for the sake of their boyfriends/girlfriends, or being fashionable and trendy. I may write more late on. I conclude for now.",NA
