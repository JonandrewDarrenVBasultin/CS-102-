"1","Will GPT-4 Run DOOM?","Adrian de Wynter","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","We show that GPT-4's reasoning and planning capabilities extend to the 1993 first-person shooter Doom. This large language model (LLM) is able to run and play the game with only a few instructions, plus a textual description--generated by the model itself from screenshots--about the state of the game being observed. We find that GPT-4 can play the game to a passable degree: it is able to manipulate doors, combat enemies, and perform pathing. More complex prompting strategies involving multiple model calls provide better results. While further work is required to enable the LLM to play the game as well as its classical, reinforcement learning-based counterparts, we note that GPT-4 required no training, leaning instead on its own reasoning and observational capabilities. We hope our work pushes the boundaries on intelligent, LLM-based agents in video games. We conclude by discussing the ethical implications of our work.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 17:30:41 UTC (1,688 KB)"

Our findings contribute to establishing new global well-posedness results for the associated master equations, also in the case of potentially degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Additionally, we show that recent advancements in global well-posedness results, specifically those related to displacement semi-monotone and anti-monotone data, can be easily obtained as a consequence of our main results.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 16:22:04 UTC (19 KB)"
"3","Trust Recognition in Human-Robot Cooperation Using EEG","Caiyue Xu, Changming Zhang, Yanmin Zhou, Zhipeng Wang, Ping Lu, Bin He","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","Collaboration between humans and robots is becoming increasingly crucial in our daily life. In order to accomplish efficient cooperation, trust recognition is vital, empowering robots to predict human behaviors and make trust-aware decisions. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a generalized approach to recognize human-robot trust. This study addresses this need by introducing an EEG-based method for trust recognition during human-robot cooperation. A human-robot cooperation game scenario is used to stimulate various human trust levels when working with robots. To enhance recognition performance, the study proposes an EEG Vision Transformer model coupled with a 3-D spatial representation to capture the spatial information of EEG, taking into account the topological relationship among electrodes. To validate this approach, a public EEG-based human trust dataset called EEGTrust is constructed. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy of 74.99% in slice-wise cross-validation and 62.00% in trial-wise cross-validation. This outperforms baseline models in both recognition accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, an ablation study demonstrates a significant improvement in trust recognition performance of the spatial representation. The source code and EEGTrust dataset are available at this https URL.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 11:28:51 UTC (1,624 KB)"
"4","Using Machine Learning to Separate Cherenkov and Scintillation Light in Hybrid Neutrino Detector","Ayse Bat","Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)","This research investigates the separation of Cherenkov and Scintillation light signals within a simulated Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector, utilizing the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The simulation data were gathered using the Rat-Pac software, which was built on the Geant4 architecture. The use of the WbLS medium has the capability to generate both Scintillation and Cherenkov light inside a single detector. To show the separation power of these two physics events, we will use the supervised learning approach. The assessment utilized a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve, with the ROC curve indicating a performance result of $0.96 \pm 1.2\times 10^{-4}$. The research also aimed to identify essential parameters for effectively distinguishing these physics events through machine learning. For this, the study also introduced the SHAP methodology, utilizing game theory to assess feature contributions. The findings demonstrated that the number of hits has a significant effect on the trained model, while the mean hit time has a somewhat smaller impact. This research advances the utilization of AI and simulation data for accurate Cherenkov and Scintillation light separation in neutrino detectors","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 09:51:09 UTC (1,723 KB)"
"5","Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games","Anthony DiGiovanni, Jesse Clifton","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 07:07:47 UTC (74 KB)"
"6","Deep Backward and Galerkin Methods for the Finite State Master Equation","Asaf Cohen, Mathieu Laurière, Ethan Zell","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","This paper proposes and analyzes two neural network methods to solve the master equation for finite-state mean field games (MFGs). Solving MFGs provides approximate Nash equilibria for stochastic, differential games with finite but large populations of agents. The master equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) whose solution characterizes MFG equilibria for any possible initial distribution. The first method we propose relies on backward induction in a time component while the second method directly tackles the PDE without discretizing time. For both approaches, we prove two types of results: there exist neural networks that make the algorithms' loss functions arbitrarily small, and conversely, if the losses are small, then the neural networks are good approximations of the master equation's solution. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments on benchmark problems from the literature up to dimension 15, and a comparison with solutions computed by a classical method for fixed initial distributions.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 01:12:11 UTC (942 KB)"

To resolve this fundamental question, we consider superstars, positions first introduced in Winning Ways where all options are nimbers. Extending Morris' classic result with hot games to tepid games, we prove that disjunctive sums of superstars are intractable to solve. This is striking as sums of nimbers can be computed in linear time. Our analyses also lead to a family of elegant board games with intriguing complexity, for which we present web-playable versions of the rulesets described within.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 23:44:13 UTC (266 KB)"
"8","Stochastic Games for Interactive Manipulation Domains","Karan Muvvala, Andrew M. Wells, Morteza Lahijanian, Lydia E. Kavraki, Moshe Y. Vardi","Robotics (cs.RO)","As robots become more prevalent, the complexity of robot-robot, robot-human, and robot-environment interactions increases. In these interactions, a robot needs to consider not only the effects of its own actions, but also the effects of other agents' actions and the possible interactions between agents. Previous works have considered reactive synthesis, where the human/environment is modeled as a deterministic, adversarial agent; as well as probabilistic synthesis, where the human/environment is modeled via a Markov chain. While they provide strong theoretical frameworks, there are still many aspects of human-robot interaction that cannot be fully expressed and many assumptions that must be made in each model. In this work, we propose stochastic games as a general model for human-robot interaction, which subsumes the expressivity of all previous representations. In addition, it allows us to make fewer modeling assumptions and leads to more natural and powerful models of interaction. We introduce the semantics of this abstraction and show how existing tools can be utilized to synthesize strategies to achieve complex tasks with guarantees. Further, we discuss the current computational limitations and improve the scalability by two orders of magnitude by a new way of constructing models for PRISM-games.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 21:46:18 UTC (3,215 KB)"
"9","The SIDO Performance Model for League of Legends","Amy X. Zhang, Parth Naidu","Applications (stat.AP)","League of Legends (LoL) has been a dominant esport for a decade, yet the inherent complexity of the game has stymied the creation of analytical measures of player skill and performance. Current industry standards are limited to easy-to-procure individual player statistics that are incomplete and lacking context as they do not take into account teamplay or game state. We present a unified performance model for League of Legends which blends together measures of a player's contribution within the context of their team, insights from traditional sports metrics such as the Plus-Minus model, and the intricacies of LoL as a complex team invasion sport. Using hierarchical Bayesian models, we outline the use of gold and damage dealt as a measure of skill, detailing players' impact on their own-, their allies'- and their enemies' statistics throughout the course of the game. Our results showcase the model's increased efficacy in separating professional players when compared to a Plus-Minus model and to current esports industry standards, while metric quality is rigorously assessed for discrimination, independence, and stability. Readers might also find additional qualitative analytics which explore champion proficiency and the impact of collaborative team-play. Future work is proposed to refine and expand the SIDO performance model, offering a comprehensive framework for esports analytics in team performance management, scouting and research realms.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 19:46:33 UTC (434 KB)"

Williamson, Michael Foss-Feig, Rahul Nandkishore","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Many-body quantum games provide a natural perspective on phases of matter in quantum hardware, crisply relating the quantum correlations inherent in phases of matter to the securing of quantum advantage at a device-oriented task. In this paper we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging mid-circuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition - witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage - on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed GHZ states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 19:00:01 UTC (1,188 KB)"

PixArt-\Sigma represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, PixArt-\alpha, offering images of markedly higher fidelity and improved alignment with text prompts. A key feature of PixArt-\Sigma is its training efficiency. Leveraging the foundational pre-training of PixArt-\alpha, it evolves from the `weaker' baseline to a `stronger' model via incorporating higher quality data, a process we term ""weak-to-strong training"". The advancements in PixArt-\Sigma are twofold: (1) High-Quality Training Data: PixArt-\Sigma incorporates superior-quality image data, paired with more precise and detailed image captions. (2) Efficient Token Compression: we propose a novel attention module within the DiT framework that compresses both keys and values, significantly improving efficiency and facilitating ultra-high-resolution image generation. Thanks to these improvements, PixArt-\Sigma achieves superior image quality and user prompt adherence capabilities with significantly smaller model size (0.6B parameters) than existing text-to-image diffusion models, such as SDXL (2.6B parameters) and SD Cascade (5.1B parameters). Moreover, PixArt-\Sigma's capability to generate 4K images supports the creation of high-resolution posters and wallpapers, efficiently bolstering the production of high-quality visual content in industries such as film and gaming.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 17:41:37 UTC (26,363 KB)"

This leads to a new class of regret-minimization algorithms that are stepsize-invariant, in the same sense as the Regret Matching and Regret Matching$^+$ algorithms for the simplex. Our modular framework can be combined with any existing regret minimizer over cones to compute a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum EFGs with perfect recall, through the self-play framework. Leveraging predictive online mirror descent, we introduce Predictive Treeplex Blackwell$^+$ (PTB$^+$), and show a $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium in self-play. We then show how to stabilize PTB$^+$ with a stepsize, resulting in an algorithm with a state-of-the-art $O(1/T)$ convergence rate. We provide an extensive set of experiments to compare our framework with several algorithmic benchmarks, including CFR$^+$ and its predictive variant, and we highlight interesting connections between practical performance and the stepsize-dependence or stepsize-invariance properties of classical algorithms.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 17:24:50 UTC (980 KB)"

Walsh, Giuseppe Casalicchio","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes (GP) has become an indispensable algorithm for black box optimization problems. Not without a dash of irony, BO is often considered a black box itself, lacking ways to provide reasons as to why certain parameters are proposed to be evaluated. This is particularly relevant in human-in-the-loop applications of BO, such as in robotics. We address this issue by proposing ShapleyBO, a framework for interpreting BO's proposals by game-theoretic Shapley values.They quantify each parameter's contribution to BO's acquisition function. Exploiting the linearity of Shapley values, we are further able to identify how strongly each parameter drives BO's exploration and exploitation for additive acquisition functions like the confidence bound. We also show that ShapleyBO can disentangle the contributions to exploration into those that explore aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Moreover, our method gives rise to a ShapleyBO-assisted human machine interface (HMI), allowing users to interfere with BO in case proposals do not align with human reasoning. We demonstrate this HMI's benefits for the use case of personalizing wearable robotic devices (assistive back exosuits) by human-in-the-loop BO. Results suggest human-BO teams with access to ShapleyBO can achieve lower regret than teams without.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 16:13:32 UTC (2,583 KB)[v2] Fri, 8 Mar 2024 07:52:32 UTC (2,583 KB)"

Some of important general solution concepts of choice problems when the set of best alternatives does not exist (this problem occurs when the preferences yielded by an economic process are cyclic) is the Stable Set (Von Neumann-Morgenstern set) and its variants (Generalized Stable set, Extended Stable set, m-Stable set and w-Stable set). The theory of w-stable sets solution is more realistic because: (1) It solves the existence problem of solution; (2) It expands the notions of maximal alternative set and (3) The concept of stability is defined in such a way as to prevent a chosen alternative from being dominated by another alternative and sets this stability within the solution. In this paper, we present a topological characterization of the existence of w-Stable sets solution of arbitrary binary relations over non-finite sets of alternatives.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 14:15:09 UTC (12 KB)"

However, due to the vast state space and computational complexity in IIEFGs, existing methods often rely on fixed abstractions, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In response, we introduce RL-CFR, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for dynamic action abstraction. RL-CFR builds upon our innovative Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, with states corresponding to public information and actions represented as feature vectors indicating specific action abstractions. The reward is defined as the expected payoff difference between the selected and default action abstractions. RL-CFR constructs a game tree with RL-guided action abstractions and utilizes counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) for strategy derivation. Impressively, it can be trained from scratch, achieving higher expected payoff without increased CFR solving time. In experiments on Heads-up No-limit Texas Hold'em, RL-CFR outperforms ReBeL's replication and Slumbot, demonstrating significant win-rate margins of $64\pm 11$ and $84\pm 17$ mbb/hand, respectively.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 09:12:23 UTC (440 KB)"

We investigate the dynamics of such Hedge-myopic system by defining a metric $Q(\textbf{x}_t)$, which measures the distance between the stage strategy $\textbf{x}_t$ and Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy of player X. We analyze the trend of $Q(\textbf{x}_t)$ and prove that it is bounded and can only take finite values on the evolutionary path when the payoff matrix is rational and the game has an interior NE. Based on this, we prove that the stage strategy sequence of both players are periodic after finite stages and the time-averaged strategy of player Y within one period is an exact NE strategy. Accordingly, we propose an asymmetric paradigm for solving two-player zero-sum games. For the special game with rational payoff matrix and an interior NE, the paradigm can output the precise NE strategy; for any general games we prove that the time-averaged strategy can converge to an approximate NE. In comparison to the NE-solving method via Hedge self-play, this HBR paradigm exhibits faster computation/convergence, better stability and can attain precise NE convergence in most real cases.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 09:01:58 UTC (2,261 KB)"

We consider ideals $\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal J$ on $\omega$ and standard ideal orderings $KB, K$. Relations between cardinality of a base of a bornology with certain selection principles related to bornological covers are established using cardinal invariants such as modified pseudointersection number, the unbounding number and slaloms numbers. When $\mathcal I \leq_\square \mathcal J$ for ideals $\mathcal I, \mathcal J$ and $\square\in \{1\text{-}1,KB,K\}$, implications among various selection principles related to bornological covers are established. Under the assumption that ideal $\mathcal I$ has a pseudounion we show equivalences among certain selection principles related to bornological covers. Finally, the $\mathcal I\text{-}\mathfrak B^s$-Hurewicz property of $X$ is investigated. We prove that $\mathcal I\text{-}\mathfrak B^s$-Hurewicz property of $X$ coincides with the $\mathfrak B^s$-Hurewicz property of $X$ if $\mathcal I$ has a pseudounion.

In this paper, we present a novel framework called the 3DTextureTransformer that enables us to generate high-quality textures without deforming the original, high-resolution input mesh. Our solution, a hybrid of geometric deep learning and StyleGAN-like architecture, is flexible enough to work on arbitrary mesh topologies and also easily extensible to texture generation for point cloud representations. Our solution employs a message-passing framework in 3D in conjunction with a StyleGAN-like architecture for 3D texture generation.

This paper presents a systematic overview of patent-related tasks and popular methodologies with a special focus on evolving and promising techniques. Language processing and particularly large language models as well as the recent boost of general generative methods promise to become game changers in the patent field. The patent literature and the fact-based argumentative procedures around patents appear almost as an ideal use case.

The paper introduces fundamental aspects of patents and patent-related data that affect technology that wants to explore or manage them. It further reviews existing methods and approaches and points out how important reliable and unbiased evaluation metrics become. Although research has made substantial progress on certain tasks, the performance across many others remains suboptimal, sometimes because of either the special nature of patents and their language or inconsistencies between legal terms and the everyday meaning of terms. Moreover, yet few methods have demonstrated the ability to produce satisfactory text for specific sections of patents.

Firstly, we find among all the models we employed, GPT-4 stands out in effectiveness, followed by Claude-2.1, with GPT-3.5, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-2-70b lagging behind. Specifically, we compare three different prompting techniques and a divide-and-conquer approach, we find that the latter was the most effective. Our divide-and-conquer approach breaks down play-by-play data into smaller, more manageable segments, solves each piece individually, and then aggregates them together. Besides the divide-and-conquer approach, we also explore the Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy, which markedly improves outcomes for certain models, notably GPT-4 and Claude-2.1, with their accuracy rates increasing significantly. However, the CoT strategy has negligible or even detrimental effects on the performance of other models like GPT-3.5 and Gemini-Pro. Secondly, to our surprise, we observe that most models, including GPT-4, struggle to accurately count the total scores for NBA quarters despite showing strong performance in counting NFL quarter scores. This leads us to further investigate the factors that impact the complexity of analytical reasoning tasks with extensive experiments, through which we conclude that task complexity depends on the length of context, the information density, and the presence of related information.

Heemels, Mauro Salazar","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","When users access shared resources in a selfish manner, the resulting societal cost and perceived users' cost is often higher than what would result from a centrally coordinated optimal allocation. While several contributions in mechanism design manage to steer the aggregate users choices to the desired optimum by using monetary tolls, such approaches bear the inherent drawback of discriminating against users with a lower income. More recently, incentive schemes based on artificial currencies have been studied with the goal of achieving a system-optimal resource allocation that is also fair. In this resource-sharing context, this paper focuses on repeated weighted congestion game with two resources, where users contribute to the congestion to different extents that are captured by individual weights. First, we address the broad concept of fairness by providing a rigorous mathematical characterization of the distinct societal metrics of equity and equality, i.e., the concepts of providing equal outcomes and equal opportunities, respectively. Second, we devise weight-dependent and time-invariant optimal pricing policies to maximize equity and equality, and prove convergence of the aggregate user choices to the system-optimum. In our framework it is always possible to achieve system-optimal allocations with perfect equity, while the maximum equality that can be reached may not be perfect, which is also shown via numerical simulations.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:16:57 UTC (285 KB)"

These functions, parameterized by neural networks, are trained using a mean squared error regression objective to match bootstrapped target values. However, scaling value-based RL methods that use regression to large networks, such as high-capacity Transformers, has proven challenging. This difficulty is in stark contrast to supervised learning: by leveraging a cross-entropy classification loss, supervised methods have scaled reliably to massive networks. Observing this discrepancy, in this paper, we investigate whether the scalability of deep RL can also be improved simply by using classification in place of regression for training value functions. We demonstrate that value functions trained with categorical cross-entropy significantly improves performance and scalability in a variety of domains. These include: single-task RL on Atari 2600 games with SoftMoEs, multi-task RL on Atari with large-scale ResNets, robotic manipulation with Q-transformers, playing Chess without search, and a language-agent Wordle task with high-capacity Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results on these domains. Through careful analysis, we show that the benefits of categorical cross-entropy primarily stem from its ability to mitigate issues inherent to value-based RL, such as noisy targets and non-stationarity. Overall, we argue that a simple shift to training value functions with categorical cross-entropy can yield substantial improvements in the scalability of deep RL at little-to-no cost.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:55:47 UTC (2,577 KB)"

We leverage the convex analysis method to derive the optimal strategies of agents in the limit as the number of agents goes to infinity. These strategies yield a Nash equilibrium for the limiting model. The model is then applied to interbank markets, focusing on optimizing lending and borrowing activities to assess systemic and individual bank risks when reserves drop below a critical threshold. We employ Fokker-Planck equations and the first hitting time method to formulate the overall probability of a bank or market default. We observe that the risk-averse behavior of agents reduces the probability of individual defaults and systemic risk, enhancing the resilience of the financial system. Adopting a similar approach based on stochastic Fokker-Planck equations, we further expand our analysis to investigate the conditional probabilities of individual default under specific trajectories of the common market shock.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:27:18 UTC (1,756 KB)"

This paper examines the potential of mouse movement dynamics as a consistent metric for continuous authentication. By analyzing user mouse movement patterns in two contrasting gaming scenarios, ""Team Fortress"" and Poly Bridge we investigate the distinctive behavioral patterns inherent in high-intensity and low-intensity UI interactions. The study extends beyond conventional methodologies by employing a range of machine learning models. These models are carefully selected to assess their effectiveness in capturing and interpreting the subtleties of user behavior as reflected in their mouse movements. This multifaceted approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of user interaction patterns. Our findings reveal that mouse movement dynamics can serve as a reliable indicator for continuous user authentication. The diverse machine learning models employed in this study demonstrate competent performance in user verification, marking an improvement over previous methods used in this field. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance computer security and highlights the potential of leveraging user behavior, specifically mouse dynamics, in developing robust authentication systems.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 16:18:02 UTC (472 KB)"

The principal and the agent have misaligned objectives and the choice of action is only left to the agent. However, the principal can influence the agent's decisions by offering incentives which add up to his rewards. The principal aims to iteratively learn an incentive policy to maximize her own total utility. This framework extends usual bandit problems and is motivated by several practical applications, such as healthcare or ecological taxation, where traditionally used mechanism design theories often overlook the learning aspect of the problem. We present nearly optimal (with respect to a horizon $T$) learning algorithms for the principal's regret in both multi-armed and linear contextual settings. Finally, we support our theoretical guarantees through numerical experiments.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 16:00:46 UTC (597 KB)"

Criminal enterprises, like legitimate businesses, balance visibility and security to thrive. This study uses evolutionary game theory to analyze criminal networks' dynamics, resilience to interventions, and responses to external conditions.

Stricter punishment doesn't always deter organized crime linearly. Network structure, particularly link density and skill assortativity, significantly influences organization formation and stability.

Due to the large costs of concealing identity, it is crucial to understand the extent of anti-LGB sentiments and reactions to coming out. However, disclosing one's sexual orientation is a personal choice, complicating data access and introducing endogeneity issues. This paper tackles these challenges by using an innovative data source from a popular online video game together with a natural experiment. We exploit exogenous variation in the identity of a playable character to identify the effects of disclosure on players' revealed preferences for that character. Leveraging detailed daily data, we monitor players' preferences for the character across diverse regions globally and employ synthetic control methods to isolate the effect of the disclosure on players' preferences. Our findings reveal a substantial and persistent negative impact of coming out. To strengthen the plausibility of social stigma as the primary explanation for the estimated effects, we systematically address and eliminate several alternative game-related channels.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 12:15:49 UTC (230 KB)"

Through simulation-based analysis, the research explores the evolution of various indicators during the game: 1) the mass of CO2 sequestration, 2) forest stands biodiversity, 3) the harvested wood volume, 4) native species fraction, and 5) protective functions. The results underscore the importance of considering diverse objectives and balancing competing interests in forestry decision processes. The forest stands designated for harvesting in the Toruń Forest District were defined as the initial strategy, and indicators for all objectives were calculated accordingly. A Nash equilibrium was identified through a game involving five players representing individual objectives with partially conflicting aims. The final strategy was obtained by modifying specific forest stands designated for harvesting, thereby maintaining the planned wood volume extraction while simultaneously reducing biodiversity loss by nearly 40%, preserving protective functions across over 600 hectares of forested areas, enhancing decadal carbon sequestration in the forest district by 100,000 tons, and additionally improving species suitability by nearly 10%. The findings suggest the potential for further research and refinement of Nash equilibrium-based optimization approaches to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of forest management practices.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 08:59:54 UTC (414 KB)"

Through the design of an additional inner-loop replay buffer, the agents can effectively learn to achieve Nash equilibrium from any distribution, mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

We identify the set of equilibrium allocations using deviator-reporting mechanisms (DRMs) on the path and single transfer schedules off the path. We design a lab experiment implementing DRMs. We observe that implemented outcomes are efficient more often than random. A majority of the time, Agents do tell the truth on the identity of a deviating Principal, despite potential gains from (tacit) collusion on false reports. As play progresses, Agents learn to play with their counterparty Agent with the average predicted probability of collusion on false reports across groups increasing from about 9% at the beginning of the experiment to just under 20% by the end.

To address this problem, we introduce Mad Lib Aug (MLA), a novel generative DocEAE data augmentation framework. Our approach leverages the intuition that Mad Libs, which are categorically masked documents used as a part of a popular game, can be generated and solved by LLMs to produce data for DocEAE. Using MLA, we achieve a 2.6-point average improvement in overall F1 score. Moreover, this approach achieves a 3.9 and 5.2 point average increase in zero and few-shot event roles compared to augmentation-free baselines across all experiments. To better facilitate analysis of cross-domain DocEAE, we additionally introduce a new metric, Role-Depth F1 (RDF1), which uses statistical depth to identify roles in the target domain which are semantic outliers with respect to roles observed in the source domain.

By introducing the concept of soliton solutions, we present a novel approach to understanding stable patterns of health improvement behaviors over time. Additionally, we delve into the role of tellurium nanoparticles and their plasmonic properties in adsorbing fake news, thereby influencing user interactions and engagement levels. Through a theoretical framework that combines nonlinear dynamics with the unique characteristics of tellurium nanoparticles, we aim to provide new insights into the dynamics of user engagement in digital health environments. Our analysis highlights the potential of soliton theory in capturing the complex, nonlinear dynamics of user behavior, while the application of plasmonic phenomena offers a promising avenue for enhancing the sensitivity and effectiveness of digital health platforms. This research ventures into an uncharted territory where optical phenomena such as Brewster's Angle and Snell's Law, along with the concept of spin solitons, are metaphorically applied to address the challenge of fake news dissemination. By exploring the analogy between light refraction, reflection, and the propagation of information in digital platforms, we unveil a novel perspective on how the 'angle' at which information is presented can significantly affect its acceptance and spread. Additionally, we propose the use of tellurium nanoparticles to manage 'information waves' through mechanisms akin to plasmonic resonance and soliton dynamics. This theoretical exploration aims to bridge the gap between physical sciences and digital communication, offering insights into the development of strategies for mitigating misinformation.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 16:07:57 UTC (904 KB)"

Jazz improvisation is a particularly noteworthy example for further investigation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we introduce a novel mathematical game theory model for jazz improvisation, providing a framework for studying music theory and improvisational methodologies. We use computational modeling, mainly reinforcement learning, to explore diverse stochastic improvisational strategies and their paired performance on improvisation. We find that the most effective strategy pair is a strategy that reacts to the most recent payoff (Stepwise Changes) with a reinforcement learning strategy limited to notes in the given chord (Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning). Conversely, a strategy that reacts to the partner's last note and attempts to harmonize with it (Harmony Prediction) strategy pair yields the lowest non-control payoff and highest standard deviation, indicating that picking notes based on immediate reactions to the partner player can yield inconsistent outcomes. On average, the Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning strategy demonstrates the highest mean payoff, while Harmony Prediction exhibits the lowest. Our work lays the foundation for promising applications beyond jazz: including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models to extract data from audio clips to refine musical reward systems, and training machine learning (ML) models on existing jazz solos to further refine strategies within the game.","Sun, 25 Feb 2024 16:46:15 UTC (466 KB)"

In this work, we propose the General Computer Control (GCC) setting: building foundation agents that can master any computer task by taking only screen images (and possibly audio) of the computer as input, and producing keyboard and mouse operations as output, similar to human-computer interaction. The main challenges of achieving GCC are: 1) the multimodal observations for decision-making, 2) the requirements of accurate control of keyboard and mouse, 3) the need for long-term memory and reasoning, and 4) the abilities of efficient exploration and self-improvement. To target GCC, we introduce Cradle, an agent framework with six main modules, including: 1) information gathering to extract multi-modality information, 2) self-reflection to rethink past experiences, 3) task inference to choose the best next task, 4) skill curation for generating and updating relevant skills for given tasks, 5) action planning to generate specific operations for keyboard and mouse control, and 6) memory for storage and retrieval of past experiences and known skills. To demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and self-improvement of Cradle, we deploy it in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption II, serving as a preliminary attempt towards GCC with a challenging target.

It is therefore important to understand what factors determine people's vaccination decisions. To this end, previous behavioural research made use of, (i) controlled but often abstract or hypothetical studies (e.g., vignettes) or, (ii) realistic but typically less flexible studies that make it difficult to understand individual decision processes (e.g., clinical trials). Combining the best of these approaches, we propose integrating real-world Bluetooth contacts via smartphones in several rounds of a game scenario, as a novel methodology to study vaccination decisions and disease spread. In our 12-week proof-of-concept study conducted with $N$ = 494 students, we found that participants strongly responded to some of the information provided to them during or after each decision round, particularly those related to their individual health outcomes. In contrast, information related to others' decisions and outcomes (e.g., the number of vaccinated or infected individuals) appeared to be less important.

The goal of Player 1 is to minimize his payoff without violating the constraints, while that of Player 2 is to either violate the state constraints, or otherwise, to maximize the payoff. One example of the game is a man-to-man matchup in football. Without state constraints, Cardaliaguet (2007) showed that the value of such a game exists and is convex to the common belief of players. Our theoretical contribution is an extension of this result to differential games with state constraints and the derivation of the primal and dual subdynamic principles necessary for computing the behavioral strategies. Compared with existing works on imperfect-information dynamic games that focus on scalability and generalization, our focus is instead on revealing the mechanism of belief manipulation behaviors resulted from information asymmetry and state constraints.

To elaborate this observation, we propose a model where individuals choose just some selected neighbors from the complete set to form a group for public goods. We explore the potential consequences by using a pair-approximation approach in a weak-selection limit. We theoretically analyze how the number of total neighbors and the actual size of the restricted group influence the critical enhancement factor where cooperation becomes dominant over defection. Furthermore, we systematically compare our model with the traditional setup and show that the critical enhancement factor is lower than in the case when all players are present in the social dilemma. Hence the suggested restricted interaction mode offers a better condition for the evolution of cooperation.

Moreover, another extension is made to the AI-Economist to include teaching with possible misalignment, again a variant of signalling game, by letting half the agents as teachers who know how to use mutually complement material resources to build houses but are not capable of building actual houses, and the other half as students who do not have this information but are able to actually build those houses if teachers teach them. I found a strong evidence that collectivistic environment such as Full-Utilitarian system is more favourable for the emergence of communication and teaching, or more precisely, evolution of language alignment. Moreover, I found some evidence that evolution of language alignment through communication and teaching under collectivistic governing systems makes individuals more advantageously inequity averse. As a result, there is a positive correlation between evolution of language alignment and equality in the society.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 14:49:14 UTC (4,347 KB)"

Focusing on the least-cost routing problem, the discussion is organized with respect to the use of Metzler functions and Metzler matrices to model the dynamics of information propagation among news providers. With this approach, we designed a strategy to minimize the spread of fake news, which is detrimental to informational health, while at the same time maximizing the spread of credible information. In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into issues related to fake news and fact-checking, and will be examined against improving informational health and public digital health.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 18:26:50 UTC (2,520 KB)"

The next stage is expected to be Human-AI collaboration; however, the research on this subject has been mixed and is in need of additional data points. We add to this nascent literature by studying Human-AI collaboration on a common administrative educational task. Education is a special domain in its relation to AI and has been slow to adopt AI approaches in practice, concerned with the educational enterprise losing its humanistic touch and because standard of quality is demanded because of the impact on a person's career and developmental trajectory. In this study (N = 22), we design an experiment to explore the effect of Human-AI collaboration on the task of tagging educational content with skills from the US common core taxonomy. Our results show that the experiment group (with AI recommendations) saved around 50% time (p < 0.01) in the execution of their tagging task but at the sacrifice of 7.7% recall (p = 0.267) and 35% accuracy (p= 0.1170) compared with the non-AI involved control group, placing the AI+human group in between the AI alone (lowest performance) and the human alone (highest performance). We further analyze log data from this AI collaboration experiment to explore under what circumstances humans still exercised their discernment when receiving recommendations. Finally, we outline how this study can assist in implementing AI tools, like ChatGPT, in education.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 17:45:52 UTC (411 KB)"

Given players' stabilizing feedback laws, the goal is to find cost function parameters that lead to a game for which the observed game dynamics are at a Nash equilibrium. Using the given feedback laws, we introduce a model-based algorithm that generates cost function parameters solving the above inverse problem. We introduce a correction procedure that at each iteration of the algorithm guarantees the existence of the feedback laws, which addresses a key challenge of output-feedback control designs. As an intermediate stage of the algorithm, we have developed a procedure for the initial stabilization of the multiple-input system with output-feedback information structure. We prove convergence and stability of the algorithm, and show the way to generate new games with necessary properties without requiring to run the complete algorithm repeatedly. Then the algorithm is extended to a model-free version that uses data samples generated by unknown dynamics and has the same converging and stabilizing properties as the model-based version. Finally, we show how the inverse problem can be solved in a distributed manner and provide possible extensions.

Most approaches consist of an iterative scheme alternating the application of the Bellman operator and a subsequent projection step onto a considered function space. However, we observe that these algorithms can be improved by considering multiple iterations of the Bellman operator at once. Thus, we introduce iterated $Q$-Networks (iQN), a novel approach that learns a sequence of $Q$-function approximations where each $Q$-function serves as the target for the next one in a chain of consecutive Bellman iterations. We demonstrate that iQN is theoretically sound and show how it can be seamlessly used in value-based and actor-critic methods.

However, most prior works on multimodal social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not densely aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. They are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper, we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore, we propose a novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with densely aligned multimodal representations in modeling social interactions.

This dual construction is used to simplify the proof of aperiodicity by considering the tiling as a colouring game on a Rhombille tiling. A simple recursive substitution system is then introduced to show the existence of a non-periodic tiling without the need for computer-aided verification. A new cut-and-project style construction linking the Turtle tiling with 1-dimensional Fibonacci words provides a second proof of non-periodicity, and an alternative demonstration that the Turtle can tile the plane. Deforming the Turtle into the Hat tile then provides a third proof for non-periodicity by considering the effect on the lattice underlying the Rhombille tiling. Finally, attention turns to the Spectre tile. In collaboration with Erhard Künzel and Yoshiaki Araki, we present two new substitution rules for generating Spectre tilings. This pair of conjugate rules show that the aperiodic monotile tilings can be considered as a 2-dimensional analog to Sturmian words.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 10:19:03 UTC (15,893 KB)"

Especially, since the lane change scenarios do not have traffic signals and traffic rules, the interactions between vehicles need to be considered for the autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative and interaction-aware decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles that stochastically considers the future behavior of surrounding vehicles based on actual driving data. The algorithm is designed for both lane changing and lane keeping vehicles, and effectively considers interaction by using an interaction model based on relative information between vehicles with fewer states. To design the decision-making, the interaction model is defined as Markov decision process, and stochastic dynamic programming is used to solve the Markov decision process. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in lane change scenarios that require interaction. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables cooperative and interaction-aware decision-making while accommodating various driving styles. Additionally, by comparing it with other methods, such as the intelligent driver model and game theory-based decision-making, we validate the safety and comfortable decision-making of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, through driving with a human-driven vehicle, it is confirmed that the proposed decision-making enables to cooperatively and effectively drive with humans.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 06:12:15 UTC (9,513 KB)"

Energy-based models~(EBMs) define a flexible energy function to parameterize unnormalized densities efficiently but are notorious for being difficult to train. Adversarial EBMs introduce a generator to form a minimax training game to avoid expensive MCMC sampling used in traditional EBMs, but a noticeable gap between adversarial EBMs and other strong generative models still exists. Inspired by diffusion-based models, we embedded EBMs into each denoising step to split a long-generated process into several smaller steps. Besides, we employ a symmetric Jeffrey divergence and introduce a variational posterior distribution for the generator's training to address the main challenges that exist in adversarial EBMs. Our experiments show significant improvement in generation compared to existing adversarial EBMs, while also providing a useful energy function for efficient density estimation.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 01:33:53 UTC (6,702 KB)"

We formulate a pair-wise logit dynamic in a continuous action space with a generalized exponential function, which we call a generalized pair-wise logit dynamic, depicted by a new evolution equation nonlocal in space. We prove the well-posedness and approximability of the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic to show that it is computationally implementable. We also show that this dynamic has an explicit connection to a mean field game of a controlled pure-jump process, with which the two different mathematical models can be understood in a unified way. Particularly, we show that the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic is derived as a myopic version of the corresponding mean field game, and that the conditions to guarantee the existence of unique solutions are different from each other. The key in this procedure is to find the objective function to be optimized in the mean field game based on the logit function. The monotonicity of the utility is unnecessary for the generalized pair-wise logit dynamic but crucial for the mean field game.

These games are often studied through the characteristic function form with transferable utility, which represents the value obtainable by each coalition. In the presence of externalities, there are many ways to define this value. Various models that account for different levels of player cooperation and the influence of external players on coalition value have been studied. Although there are different approaches, typically, the optimistic and pessimistic approaches provide sufficient insights into strategic interactions. This paper clarifies the interpretation of these approaches by providing a unified framework. We show that making sure that no coalition receives more than their (optimistic) upper bounds is always at least as difficult as guaranteeing their (pessimistic) lower bounds. We also show that if externalities are negative, providing these guarantees is always feasible. Then, we explore applications and show how our findings can be applied to derive results from the existing literature.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 08:34:38 UTC (41 KB)"

Hence, blocking the devastating cascades is an important issue in real world networks. One of the ways to control the cascade is to use protective measures, so that the agents decide to be protected against failure. Here, we consider a coevolution of the linear threshold model for the spread of cascading failures and a decision-making game based on the perceived risk of failure. Protected agents are less vulnerable to failure and in return the size of the cascade affects the agent's decision to get insured. We find at what range of protection efficiency and cost of failure, the global cascades stop. Also we observe that in some range of protection efficiency, a bistable region emerges for the size of cascade and the prevalence of protected agents.

All agents are coupled through the average state of the population appearing in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each agent involves the state, control, and the average state processes.

Classical models of reinforcement learning (e.g., MDPs, POMDPs, Dec-POMDPs, and POMGs) assume a very simple and highly regular information structure, while more general models like predictive state representations do not explicitly model the information structure. By contrast, real-world sequential decision-making problems typically involve a complex and time-varying interdependence of system variables, requiring a rich and flexible representation of information structure. In this paper, we argue for the perspective that explicit representation of information structures is an important component of analyzing and solving reinforcement learning problems. We propose novel reinforcement learning models with an explicit representation of information structure, capturing classical models as special cases. We show that this leads to a richer analysis of sequential decision-making problems and enables more tailored algorithm design. In particular, we characterize the ""complexity"" of the observable dynamics of any sequential decision-making problem through a graph-theoretic analysis of the DAG representation of its information structure. The central quantity in this analysis is the minimal set of variables that $d$-separates the past observations from future observations. Furthermore, through constructing a generalization of predictive state representations, we propose tailored reinforcement learning algorithms and prove that the sample complexity is in part determined by the information structure. This recovers known tractability results and gives a novel perspective on reinforcement learning in general sequential decision-making problems, providing a systematic way of identifying new tractable classes of problems.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 21:28:19 UTC (492 KB)"

Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces Off-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework.

The game is unique due to the way that language and coordination between teammates play important roles. Previous approaches to designing agents for this game have utilized a single internal language model to determine action choices. This often leads to good performance with some teammates and inferior performance with other teammates, as the agent cannot adapt to any specific teammate. In this paper we present the first adaptive agent for playing Codenames. We adopt an ensemble approach with the goal of determining, during the course of interacting with a specific teammate, which of our internal expert agents, each potentially with its own language model, is the best match. One difficulty faced in this approach is the lack of a single numerical metric that accurately captures the performance of a Codenames team. Prior Codenames research has utilized a handful of different metrics to evaluate agent teams. We propose a novel single metric to evaluate the performance of a Codenames team, whether playing a single team (solitaire) game, or a competitive game against another team. We then present and analyze an ensemble agent which selects an internal expert on each turn in order to maximize this proposed metric. Experimental analysis shows that this ensemble approach adapts to individual teammates and often performs nearly as well as the best internal expert with a teammate. Crucially, this success does not depend on any previous knowledge about the teammates, the ensemble agents, or their compatibility. This research represents an important step to making language-based agents for cooperative language settings like Codenames more adaptable to individual teammates.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 23:15:07 UTC (276 KB)"

To fill this gap in the literature, we present NetPlay, the first LLM-powered zero-shot agent for the challenging roguelike NetHack. NetHack is a particularly challenging environment due to its diverse set of items and monsters, complex interactions, and many ways to die. NetPlay uses an architecture designed for dynamic robot environments, modified for NetHack. Like previous approaches, it prompts the LLM to choose from predefined skills and tracks past interactions to enhance decision-making. Given NetHack's unpredictable nature, NetPlay detects important game events to interrupt running skills, enabling it to react to unforeseen circumstances. While NetPlay demonstrates considerable flexibility and proficiency in interacting with NetHack's mechanics, it struggles with ambiguous task descriptions and a lack of explicit feedback.

Each player aims to maximize the cumulative number of objectives they control, weighted by their criticality. To solve this large-scale stochastic game, we derive properties of its Markov perfect equilibria by leveraging the logistics and military operational command and control structure. We show the consequential isotonicity of the optimal value function with respect to the partially ordered state space, which in turn leads to a significant reduction of the state and action spaces.

If the problems lie in the framework, and many do, then the computational complexity can be described for all monotone classes defined by a finite set of omitted subgraphs. It is known that certain homomorphism problems, e.g. $C_5$-Colouring, do not sit in the framework. By contrast, we show that the more general problem of Graph Homomorphism does sit in the framework. The original framework had examples where hard versus easy were NP-complete versus P, or at least quadratic versus almost linear. We give the first example of a problem in the framework such that hardness is in the polynomial hierarchy above NP. Considering a variant of the colouring game as studied by Bodlaender, we show that with the restriction of bounded alternation, the list version of this problem is contained in the framework. The hard cases are $\Pi_{2k}^\mathrm{P}$-complete and the easy cases are in P. The cases in P comprise those classes for which the pathwidth is bounded. Bodlaender explains that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is in P on classes with bounded vertex separation number, which coincides with bounded pathwidth on unordered graphs. However, these graphs are ordered with a playing order for the two players, which corresponds to a prefix pattern in a quantified formula. We prove that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is Pspace-complete on some class of bounded pathwidth, using a celebrated result of Atserias and Oliva. We consider several locally constrained variants of the homomorphism problem. Like $C_5$-Colouring, none of these is in the framework. However, when we consider the bounded-degree restrictions, we prove that each of these problems is in our framework.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 12:29:37 UTC (32 KB)"

We interpret the model in a competitive environment, hence we set it in the framework of Mean Field Games. We rephrase the problem in an infinite dimensional setting, in order to obtain the associated Mean Field Game system.

In these games, one player, referred to as the system, declares his strategy upfront. The other players, composing the environment, then rationally make their moves according to their objectives. The rational behavior of these responding players is captured through two models: they opt for strategies that either represent a Nash equilibrium or lead to a play with a Pareto-optimal cost tuple.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 09:38:22 UTC (263 KB)"

Kohn and Serfaty (2006) give a deterministic two-person zero-sum game whose value functions approximate the solution to the level set mean curvature flow equation without obstacle functions. We prove that moving curves governed by the mean curvature flow converge in time to the boundary of the convex hull of obstacles under some assumptions on the initial curves and obstacles. Convexity of the initial set, as well as smoothness of the initial curves and obstacles, are not needed. In these proofs, we utilize properties of the game trajectories given by very elementary game strategies and consider reachability of each player. Also, when the equation has a driving force term, we present several examples of the asymptotic behavior, including a problem dealt in Giga, Mitake and Tran (2016).","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 08:38:16 UTC (104 KB)"

In this paper, we focus on finding an unexploitable equilibrium in large team games. An unexploitable equilibrium is a worst-case policy, where members in the opponent team cannot increase their team reward by taking any policy, e.g., cooperatively changing to other joint policies. As an optimal unexploitable equilibrium in two-team zero-sum games, correlated-team maxmin equilibrium remains unexploitable even in the worst case where players in the opponent team can achieve arbitrary cooperation through a joint team policy. However, finding such an equilibrium in large games is challenging due to the impracticality of evaluating the exponentially large number of joint policies. To solve this problem, we first introduce a general solution concept called restricted correlated-team maxmin equilibrium, which solves the problem of being impossible to evaluate all joint policy by a sample factor while avoiding an exploitation problem under the incomplete joint policy evaluation. We then develop an efficient sequential correlation mechanism, and based on which we propose an algorithm for approximating the unexploitable equilibrium in large games. We show that our approach achieves lower exploitability than the state-of-the-art baseline when encountering opponent teams with different exploitation ability in large team games including Google Research Football.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 03:40:34 UTC (13,433 KB)"

There are two key challenges in the application of the well-known Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck (HJB-FP) approach to our problems: the path-dependence due to the conditional mean-field interaction and the time-inconsistency due to the general discounting cost. To overcome the difficulties, a theory for a class of systems of path-dependent equilibrium Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations (HJBs) is developed. Then closed-loop equilibrium strategies can be identified through a two-step verification procedure. It should be noted that the closed-loop equilibrium strategies obtained satisfy a new form of local optimality in the Nash sense. The theory obtained extends the HJB-FP approach for classical MFGs to more general conditional MFGs with general discounting costs.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 02:11:14 UTC (32 KB)"

In many such two-agent systems, each agent learns separately and the rewards of the two agents are not perfectly aligned. To better understand such cases, we examine the learning dynamics of the two-agent system and the implications for each agent's objective. We model these systems as Stackelberg games with decentralized learning and show that standard regret benchmarks (such as Stackelberg equilibrium payoffs) result in worst-case linear regret for at least one player. To better capture these systems, we construct a relaxed regret benchmark that is tolerant to small learning errors by agents. We show that standard learning algorithms fail to provide sublinear regret, and we develop algorithms to achieve near-optimal $O(T^{2/3})$ regret for both players with respect to these benchmarks. We further design relaxed environments under which faster learning ($O(\sqrt{T})$) is possible. Altogether, our results take a step towards assessing how two-agent interactions in sequential and decentralized learning environments affect the utility of both agents.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 23:38:28 UTC (66 KB)"

Despite their significant potential, the implications for public health have been largely overlooked, highlighting a critical gap in recognition and preparation. This oversight necessitates immediate action, as public health remains largely unaware of quantum technologies as a tool for advancement. The application of quantum principles to epidemiology and health informatics, termed quantum health epidemiology and quantum health informatics, has the potential to radically transform disease surveillance, prediction, modeling, and analysis of health data. However, there is a notable lack of quantum expertise within the public health workforce and educational pipelines. This gap underscores the urgent need for the development of quantum literacy among public health practitioners, leaders, and students to leverage emerging opportunities while addressing risks and ethical considerations. Innovative teaching methods, such as interactive simulations, games, visual models, and other tailored platforms, offer viable solutions for bridging knowledge gaps without the need for advanced physics or mathematics. However, the opportunity to adapt is fleeting as the quantum era in healthcare looms near.

We find that with a surprisingly modest resource budget, this simple Monte Carlo optimization strategy yields informative questions that mirror human performance across varied Battleship board scenarios. In contrast, LLM-only baselines struggle to ground questions in the board state; notably, GPT-4V provides no improvement over non-visual baselines.

Despite this achievement, however, it is not readily applicable to developing interactive applications. Real-time applications like XR apps and games require functions such as animation, UV-mapping, and model editing simultaneously manipulated through the usage of a 3D model. We propose a modeling that is analogous to typical 3D models, which we call 3D Gaussian Model (3DGM); it provides a manipulatable proxy for novel animation and texture transfer. By binding the 3D Gaussians in texture space and re-projecting them back to world space through implicit shell mapping, we show how our 3D modeling can serve as a valid rendering methodology for interactive applications. It is further noted that recently, 3D mesh reconstruction works have been able to produce high-quality mesh for rendering. Our work, on the other hand, only requires an approximated geometry for rendering an object in high fidelity. Applicationwise, we will show that our proxy-based 3DGM is capable of driving novel animation without animated training data and texture transferring via UV mapping of the 3D Gaussians. We believe the result indicates the potential of our work for enabling interactive applications for 3D Gaussian Splatting.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:43:43 UTC (24,864 KB)"

In this paper, we investigate whether multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms can be used to understand iterative combinatorial auctions, given that these algorithms have recently shown empirical success in several other domains. We find that MARL can indeed benefit auction analysis, but that deploying it effectively is nontrivial. We begin by describing modelling decisions that keep the resulting game tractable without sacrificing important features such as imperfect information or asymmetry between bidders. We also discuss how to navigate pitfalls of various MARL algorithms, how to overcome challenges in verifying convergence, and how to generate and interpret multiple equilibria. We illustrate the promise of our resulting approach by using it to evaluate a specific rule change to a clock auction, finding substantially different auction outcomes due to complex changes in bidders' behavior.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:16:13 UTC (1,679 KB)"

In order to investigate the decision making process in the heterogeneous mixing population regarding whether to be vaccinated or not, we propose the modeling framework which includes the epidemic models and the game theoretical analysis. We consider two sources of heterogeneity in this paper: the different activity levels and the different relative vaccination costs. It is interesting to observe that, if both sources of heterogeneity are considered, there exist a finite number of Nash equilibria (evolutionary stable strategies (ESS)) of the vaccination game. While if only the difference of activity levels is considered, there are infinitely many Nash equilibira. For the latter case, the initial condition of the decision making process becomes highly sensitive. In the application of public health management, the inclusion of population heterogeneity significantly complicates the prediction of the overall vaccine coverage level.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:19:59 UTC (42 KB)"

However, little research has been conducted on whether this applies to mobile games played by adolescents. Therefore, we examined the influence of color stimuli hue and saturation on mobile game play. Adolescents (n=21) played a mobile platformer game with varying hue and saturation per level for about 25 minutes. We gathered data on emotional states after each level using the Self-Assessment Manikin questionnaire, recorded time spent in each level, and collected participant self-reports on their video game experience. We performed statistical tests, such as ANOVA, which depict no significant influence of hue and/or saturation on the emotional state of our players. We conclude that it is possible that color alone is not an effective measure for eliciting emotion in mobile games, and further research is needed to consider measures such as time spent in the game and screen size, as these are unique to mobile games. There was a noticeable variance in emotional response between male and female players, with a significant interaction of hue and saturation among male players for valence ratings. This may be an indication that color preference influences perceived pleasantness.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:47:13 UTC (657 KB)"

In the considered system model, UAVs are divided into multiple swarms, with each swarm consisting of a leader UAV and several follower UAVs to provide computing services to end-users. Unlike existing work, we allow UAVs to dynamically cluster into different swarms, i.e., each follower UAV can change its leader based on the time-varying spatial positions, updated application placement, etc. in a dynamic manner. Meanwhile, UAVs are required to dynamically schedule their energy replenishment, application placement, trajectory planning and task delegation. With the aim of maximizing the long-term energy efficiency of the UAV swarm assisted MEC system, a joint optimization problem of dynamic clustering and scheduling is formulated. Taking into account the underlying cooperation and competition among intelligent UAVs, we further reformulate this optimization problem as a combination of a series of strongly coupled multi-agent stochastic games, and then propose a novel reinforcement learning-based UAV swarm dynamic coordination (RLDC) algorithm for obtaining the equilibrium. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the RLDC algorithm and demonstrate its superiority over counterparts.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:05:23 UTC (1,407 KB)"

We study entanglement via the lens of computational complexity by considering quantum generalizations of the class NP with multiple unentangled quantum proofs, the so-called QMA(2) and its variants. The complexity of QMA(2) is a longstanding open problem, and only the trivial bounds QMA $\subseteq$ QMA(2) $\subseteq$ NEXP are known. In this work, we study the power of unentangled quantum proofs with non-negative amplitudes, a class which we denote $\text{QMA}^+(2)$. In this setting, we are able to design proof verification protocols for problems both using logarithmic size quantum proofs and having a constant probability gap in distinguishing yes from no instances. In particular, we design global protocols for small set expansion, unique games, and PCP verification. As a consequence, we obtain NP $\subseteq \text{QMA}^+_{\log}(2)$ with a constant gap. By virtue of the new constant gap, we are able to ``scale up'' this result to $\text{QMA}^+(2)$, obtaining the full characterization $\text{QMA}^+(2)$=NEXP by establishing stronger explicitness properties of the PCP for NEXP. One key novelty of these protocols is the manipulation of quantum proofs in a global and coherent way yielding constant gaps. Previous protocols (only available for general amplitudes) are either local having vanishingly small gaps or treat the quantum proofs as classical probability distributions requiring polynomially many proofs thereby not implying non-trivial bounds on QMA(2). Finally, we show that QMA(2) is equal to $\text{QMA}^+(2)$ provided the gap of the latter is a sufficiently large constant. In particular, if $\text{QMA}^+(2)$ admits gap amplification, then QMA(2)=NEXP.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 01:35:46 UTC (75 KB)"

To address these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (\textsc{col}), an online method for generic \textsc{aisg}s. \textsc{col} uses a forecaster-actor-critic (\textsc{fac}) architecture where subjective forecasts is used to conjecture the opponents' strategies and break belief hierarchies (forecaster), online rollout is used to adapt strategies to nonstationary environments (actor), Monte-Carlo simulation is used to estimate costs (critic), and Bayesian learning is used to calibrate conjectures. We prove that the conjectures produced by \textsc{col} are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency.

Within such networks, roadside units (RSUs) serve as intermediates in facilitating communication. Therefore, the deployment of RSUs is of utmost importance in ensuring the quality of communication services. However, the optimization objectives, such as time delay and deployment cost, are commonly developed from diverse perspectives. As a result, it is possible that conflicts may arise among the objectives. Furthermore, in urban environments, the presence of various obstacles, such as buildings, gardens, lakes, and other infrastructure, poses challenges for the deployment of RSUs. Hence, the deployment encounters significant difficulties due to the existence of multiple objectives, constraints imposed by obstacles, and the necessity to explore a large-scale optimization space. To address this issue, two versions of multi-objective optimization algorithms are proposed in this paper. By utilizing a multi-population strategy and an adaptive exploration technique, the methods efficiently explore a large-scale decision-variable space. In order to mitigate the issue of an overcrowded deployment of RSUs, a calibrating mechanism is adopted to adjust RSU density during the optimization procedures. The proposed methods also take care of data offloading between vehicles and RSUs by setting up an iterative best response sequence game (IBRSG). By comparing the proposed algorithms with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the results demonstrate that our strategies perform better in both high-density and low-density urban scenarios. The results also indicate that the proposed solutions substantially improve the efficiency of vehicular networks.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 05:02:12 UTC (43,854 KB)"
"106","Play like a Vertex: A Stackelberg Game Approach for Streaming Graph Partitioning","Zezhong Ding, Yongan Xiang, Shangyou Wang, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","In the realm of distributed systems tasked with managing and processing large-scale graph-structured data, optimizing graph partitioning stands as a pivotal challenge. The primary goal is to minimize communication overhead and runtime cost. However, alongside the computational complexity associated with optimal graph partitioning, a critical factor to consider is memory overhead. Real-world graphs often reach colossal sizes, making it impractical and economically unviable to load the entire graph into memory for partitioning. This is also a fundamental premise in distributed graph processing, where accommodating a graph with non-distributed systems is unattainable. Currently, existing streaming partitioning algorithms exhibit a skew-oblivious nature, yielding satisfactory partitioning results exclusively for specific graph types. In this paper, we propose a novel streaming partitioning algorithm, the Skewness-aware Vertex-cut Partitioner S5P, designed to leverage the skewness characteristics of real graphs for achieving high-quality partitioning. S5P offers high partitioning quality by segregating the graph's edge set into two subsets, head and tail sets. Following processing by a skewness-aware clustering algorithm, these two subsets subsequently undergo a Stackelberg graph game. Our extensive evaluations conducted on substantial real-world and synthetic graphs demonstrate that, in all instances, the partitioning quality of S5P surpasses that of existing streaming partitioning algorithms, operating within the same load balance constraints. For example, S5P can bring up to a 51% improvement in partitioning quality compared to the top partitioner among the baselines. Lastly, we showcase that the implementation of S5P results in up to an 81% reduction in communication cost and a 130% increase in runtime efficiency for distributed graph processing tasks on PowerGraph.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 12:57:22 UTC (1,367 KB)"
"107","The Cost of Permissionless Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers","Julian Ma, Davide Crapis","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Automated market makers (AMMs) allocate fee revenue proportional to the amount of liquidity investors deposit. In this paper, we study the economic consequences of the competition between passive liquidity providers (LPs) caused by this allocation rule. We employ a game-theoretic model in which $N$ strategic agents optimally provide liquidity. In this setting, we find that competition drives LPs to provide excess liquidity. In the limit, the excess liquidity converges to a constant that linearly increases with the amount of base demand, demand that is insensitive to trading costs. Providing excess liquidity is costly as more capital is exposed to adverse selection costs, leading to a loss in welfare. Our main result is that the price of anarchy, defined over the liquidity provider performance, is $O(N)$, implying that the welfare loss scales linearly with the number of liquidity providers. We show that this result is still observable when using richer aggregate demand models.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 11:37:09 UTC (361 KB)"

In this work, we focus on the recently introduced class of constrained Markov Potential Games. While centralized algorithms have been proposed for solving such constrained games, the design of converging independent learning algorithms tailored for the constrained setting remains an open question. We propose an independent policy gradient algorithm for learning approximate constrained Nash equilibria: Each agent observes their own actions and rewards, along with a shared state. Inspired by the optimization literature, our algorithm performs proximal-point-like updates augmented with a regularized constraint set. Each proximal step is solved inexactly using a stochastic switching gradient algorithm. Notably, our algorithm can be implemented independently without a centralized coordination mechanism requiring turn-based agent updates. Under some technical constraint qualification conditions, we establish convergence guarantees towards constrained approximate Nash equilibria. We perform simulations to illustrate our results.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 20:57:35 UTC (370 KB)"

However, as with finite games, mixed strategies are often desired, both from an equilibrium existence perspective as well as a competitive perspective. To that end, this work investigates a chance-constraint-based approach to coupled constraints in generalized Nash equilibrium problems which are solved over pure strategies and mixing weights simultaneously. We motivate these constraints in a discrete setting, placing them on tensor games ($n$-player bimatrix games) as a justifiable approach to handling the probabilistic nature of mixing. Then, we describe a numerical solution method for these chance constrained tensor games with simultaneous pure strategy optimization. Finally, using a modified pursuit-evasion game as a motivating examples, we demonstrate the actual behavior of this solution method in terms of its fidelity, parameter sensitivity, and efficiency.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 20:20:53 UTC (419 KB)"

In the framework of evolutionary game theory, public goods games (PGGs) are used to analyse scenarios where individuals can cooperate or defect, and can predict when and how these behaviours emerge.

Here, we focus on PGGs arising in disease modelling of cancer evolution and the spread of infectious diseases. We use these two systems as case studies for the development of the theory and applications of PGGs, which we succinctly review and compare. We also posit that applications of evolutionary game theory to decision-making in cancer, such as interactions between a clinician and a tumour, can learn from the PGGs studied in epidemiology, where cooperative behaviours such as quarantine and vaccination compliance have been more thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, instances of cellular-level cooperation observed in cancers point to a corresponding area of potential interest for modellers of other diseases, be they viral, bacterial or otherwise. We aim to demonstrate the breadth of applicability of PGGs in disease modelling while providing a starting point for those interested in quantifying cooperation arising in healthcare.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 19:09:49 UTC (323 KB)"

We use double-boundary hyper-boxes to represent granules, and customize the adaptation procedures to enhance the robustness of outer boxes for data coverage and noise suppression, while ensuring that inner boxes remain flexible to capture drifts. The classifier evolves from scratch, incorporates new classes on the fly, and performs local incremental feature weighting. As an application, we focus on the classification of emotion-related patterns within electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Emotion recognition is crucial for enhancing the realism and interactivity of computer systems. We extract features from the Fourier spectrum of EEG signals obtained from 28 individuals engaged in playing computer games -- a public dataset. Each game elicits a different predominant emotion: boredom, calmness, horror, or joy. We analyze individual electrodes, time window lengths, and frequency bands to assess the accuracy and interpretability of resulting user-independent neural models. The findings indicate that both brain hemispheres assist classification, especially electrodes on the temporal (T8) and parietal (P7) areas, alongside contributions from frontal and occipital electrodes. While patterns may manifest in any band, the Alpha (8-13Hz), Delta (1-4Hz), and Theta (4-8Hz) bands, in this order, exhibited higher correspondence with the emotion classes. The eGNN-C+ demonstrates effectiveness in learning EEG data. It achieves an accuracy of 81.7% and a 0.0029 II interpretability using 10-second time windows, even in face of a highly-stochastic time-varying 4-class classification problem.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:11:41 UTC (674 KB)"

This study investigates the neural correlates of interacting with intentional versus artificial agents in a simulated tennis game scenario. Employing functional near-infrared imaging spectroscopy (fNIRS), we analyzed brain activity in 50 male participants during gameplay against both types of opponents. Our methodological approach ensures ecological validity by simulating real-world decision-making scenarios while participants undergo fNIRS scanning, avoiding the constraints of traditional neuroimaging methods. We focus on six prefrontal cortex channels, leveraging the 10-20 system, to capture nuanced differences in brain activity. Utilizing wavelet analysis, we dissected the data into frequency-specific differences, revealing subtle variations across different channels and frequency bands. Moreover, we quantified activity by comparing average data signals between rest and play modes across all points. Our findings unveil significant differences in neural activation patterns, particularly in one specific channel and frequency range, suggesting distinct cognitive processing when interacting with intentional agents. These results align with previous neuroimaging studies and contribute to understanding the neural underpinnings of human-agent interactions in naturalistic settings. While acknowledging study limitations, including sample homogeneity and spatial accuracy constraints, our findings underscore the potential of fNIRS in exploring complex cognitive phenomena beyond laboratory confines.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:20:46 UTC (5,268 KB)"

However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios e.g., large interactive games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy. Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, fine-tuning its irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold'em, outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits numerous LLM-based applications.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:09:20 UTC (2,597 KB)"

Before the game starts, each edge of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is removed independently with probability $1-p$. After that, Maker chooses a vertex $v_0$ to protect. Then, in each round Maker and Breaker claim respectively $m$ and $b$ unclaimed edges of $G$. Breaker wins if after the removal of the edges claimed by him the component of $v_0$ becomes finite, and Maker wins if she can indefinitely prevent Breaker from winning. We show that for any $p < 1$, Breaker almost surely has a wining strategy for the $(1,1)$ game on $(\mathbb{Z}^2)_p$. This fully answers a question of Day and Falgas-Ravry, who showed that for $p = 1$ Maker has a winning strategy for the $(1,1)$ game. Further, we show that in the $(2,1)$ game on $(\mathbb{Z}^2)_p$ Maker almost surely has a winning strategy whenever $p > 0.9402$, while Breaker almost surely has a winning strategy whenever $p < 0.5278$. This shows that the threshold value of $p$ above which Maker has a winning strategy for the $(2,1)$ game on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is non-trivial. In fact, we prove similar results in various settings, including other lattices and biases $(m,b)$. These results extend also to the most general case, which we introduce, where each edge is given to Maker with probability $\alpha$ and to Breaker with probability $\beta$ before the game starts.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 14:40:36 UTC (38 KB)"
"117","PureLottery: Fair and Bias-Resistant Leader Election with a Novel Single-Elimination Tournament Algorithm","Jonas Ballweg","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Leader Election (LE) is crucial in distributed systems and blockchain technology, ensuring one participant acts as the leader. Traditional LE methods often depend on distributed random number generation (RNG), facing issues like vulnerability to manipulation, lack of fairness, and the need for complex procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS). This Bachelor's thesis presents a novel approach to randomized LE, leveraging a game-theoretic assumption that participants, aiming to be chosen as leaders, will naturally avoid actions that diminish their chances. This perspective simplifies LE by eliminating the need for decentralized RNG. Introducing PureLottery, inspired by single-elimination sports tournaments, this method offers a fair, bias-resistant, and efficient LE solution for blockchain environments. It operates on the principle of two participants competing in each match, rendering collusion efforts useless. PureLottery stands out for its low computational and communication complexity, suitable for smart contract implementation. It provides strong game-theoretic incentives for honesty and is robust against adversaries, ensuring no increase in election chances through dishonesty. The protocol guarantees that each honest player has at least a 1/n chance of winning, irrespective of adversary manipulation among the other n-1 participants. PureLottery can also address related problems like participant ranking, electing multiple leaders, and leader aversion, showcasing its versatility across various applications, including lotteries and blockchain protocols.

Our main result is that the compiler proposed by Kalai et al. is sound for any two-player XOR game. A celebrated theorem of Tsirelson shows that for XOR games, the quantum value is exactly given by a semidefinite program, and we obtain our result by showing that the SDP upper bound holds for the compiled game up to a negligible error arising from the compilation.

The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter that is subject to a generalized net energy metering (NEM) tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community manager and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renewable generation.

However, the process is often time-consuming and demands a high level of skill. In this paper, we present a novel approach to create volumetric representations of 3D characters from consistent turnaround concept art, which serves as the standard input in the 3D modeling industry. While Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has been a game-changer in image-based 3D reconstruction, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known research that optimizes the pipeline for concept art.

Motivated by this tension and drawing from bounded rationality, we introduce a dynamic model of candidate positioning based on a simple behavioral heuristic: candidates imitate the policy of previous winners. The resulting model is closely connected to evolutionary replicator dynamics and exhibits complex behavior, despite its simplicity. For uniformly-distributed voters, we prove that when there are $k = 2$, $3$, or $4$ candidates per election, any symmetric candidate distribution converges over time to a concentration of candidates at the center. With $k \ge 5$, however, we prove that the candidate distribution does not converge to the center. For initial distributions without any extreme candidates, we prove a stronger statement than non-convergence, showing that the density in an interval around the center goes to zero when $k \ge 5$. As a matter of robustness, our conclusions are qualitatively unchanged if a small fraction of candidates are not winner-copiers and are instead positioned uniformly at random. Beyond our theoretical analysis, we illustrate our results in simulation; for five or more candidates, we find a tendency towards the emergence of two clusters, a mechanism suggestive of Duverger's Law, the empirical finding that plurality leads to two-party systems. Our simulations also explore several variations of the model, including non-uniform voter distributions and other forms of noise, which exhibit similar convergence patterns. Finally, we discuss the relationship between our model and prior work on strategic equilibria of candidate positioning games.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 01:04:07 UTC (4,073 KB)"

The Agents are non-myopic, and so a mechanism for the Principal induces a $T$-round extensive form game amongst the Agents. We give several results aimed at understanding an under-explored aspect of contract theory -- the game induced when choosing an Agent to contract with. First, we show that this game admits a pure-strategy \emph{non-responsive} equilibrium amongst the Agents -- informally an equilibrium in which the Agent's actions depend on the history of realized states of nature, but not on the history of each other's actions, and so avoids the complexities of collusion and threats. Next, we show that if the Principal selects Agents using a \emph{monotone} bandit algorithm, then for any concave contract, in any such equilibrium, the Principal obtains no regret to contracting with the best Agent in hindsight -- not just given their realized actions, but also to the counterfactual world in which they had offered a guaranteed $T$-round contract to the best Agent in hindsight, which would have induced a different sequence of actions. Finally, we show that if the Principal selects Agents using a monotone bandit algorithm which guarantees no swap-regret, then the Principal can additionally offer only limited liability contracts (in which the Agent never needs to pay the Principal) while getting no-regret to the counterfactual world in which she offered a linear contract to the best Agent in hindsight -- despite the fact that linear contracts are not limited liability. We instantiate this theorem by demonstrating the existence of a monotone no swap-regret bandit algorithm, which to our knowledge has not previously appeared in the literature.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 01:01:59 UTC (46 KB)"

These memristors operate in a non-filamentary, low conductance regime, which enables stable and energy efficient operation. They can act as multi-functional hardware synapses in a class of bio-inspired deep neural networks (DNN) that make use of both long- and short-term synaptic dynamics and are capable of meta-learning or ""learning-to-learn"". The resulting bio-inspired DNN is then trained to play the video game Atari Pong, a complex reinforcement learning task in a dynamic environment. Our analysis shows that the energy consumption of the DNN with multi-functional memristive synapses decreases by about two orders of magnitude as compared to a pure GPU implementation.

We consider a particular case of time scales s between the interactions of the agents and the strategy update. We find the cooperative effects is affected by the noise level and the group distribution,consequently it induces different dynamic behavior.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 05:50:23 UTC (91 KB)"
"130","Polynomial-Time Computation of Exact $Φ$-Equilibria in Polyhedral Games","Gabriele Farina, Charilaos Pipis","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","It is a well-known fact that correlated equilibria can be computed in polynomial time in a large class of concisely represented games using the celebrated Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm (Papadimitriou and Roughgarden, 2008; Jiang and Leyton-Brown, 2015). However, the landscape of efficiently computable equilibria in sequential (extensive-form) games remains unknown. The Ellipsoid Against Hope does not apply directly to these games, because they do not have the required ""polynomial type"" property. Despite this barrier, Huang and von Stengel (2008) altered the algorithm to compute exact extensive-form correlated equilibria. In this paper, we generalize the Ellipsoid Against Hope and develop a simple algorithmic framework for efficiently computing saddle-points in bilinear zero-sum games, even when one of the dimensions is exponentially large. Moreover, the framework only requires a ""good-enough-response"" oracle, which is a weakened notion of a best-response oracle. Using this machinery, we develop a general algorithmic framework for computing exact linear $\Phi$-equilibria in any polyhedral game (under mild assumptions), including correlated equilibria in normal-form games, and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. This enables us to give the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing exact linear-deviation correlated equilibria in extensive-form games, thus resolving an open question by Farina and Pipis (2023). Furthermore, even for the cases for which a polynomial time algorithm for exact equilibria was already known, our framework provides a conceptually simpler solution.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 05:44:24 UTC (62 KB)"
"131","Catch Me If You Can: Combatting Fraud in Artificial Currency Based Government Benefits Programs","Devansh Jalota, Matthew Tsao, Marco Pavone","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","Artificial currencies have grown in popularity in many real-world resource allocation settings, gaining traction in government benefits programs like food assistance and transit benefits programs. However, such programs are susceptible to misreporting fraud, wherein users can misreport their private attributes to gain access to more artificial currency (credits) than they are entitled to. To address the problem of misreporting fraud in artificial currency based benefits programs, we introduce an audit mechanism that induces a two-stage game between an administrator and users. In our proposed mechanism, the administrator running the benefits program can audit users at some cost and levy fines against them for misreporting their information. For this audit game, we study the natural solution concept of a signaling game equilibrium and investigate conditions on the administrator budget to establish the existence of equilibria. The computation of equilibria can be done via linear programming in our problem setting through an appropriate design of the audit rules. Our analysis also provides upper bounds that hold in any signaling game equilibrium on the expected excess payments made by the administrator and the probability that users misreport their information. We further show that the decrease in misreporting fraud corresponding to our audit mechanism far outweighs the administrator spending to run it by establishing that its total costs are lower than that of the status quo with no audits. Finally, to highlight the practical viability of our audit mechanism in mitigating misreporting fraud, we present a case study based on the Washington D.C. federal transit benefits program. In this case study, the proposed audit mechanism achieves several orders of magnitude improvement in total cost compared to a no-audit strategy for some parameter ranges.","Sun, 25 Feb 2024 17:48:21 UTC (961 KB)"

However, making such real-time predictions is challenging due to unpredictable variables within the game involving diverse player strategies and decision-making. Our work attempts to enhance audience engagement within video game tournaments by introducing a real-time method of predicting wins. Our Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTMs) based approach enables efficient predictions of win-lose outcomes by only using the health indicator of each player as a time series. As a proof of concept, we evaluate our model's performance within a classic, two-player arcade game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo. We also benchmark our method against state of the art methods for time series forecasting; i.e. Transformer models found in large language models (LLMs).

"134","Statistical Games","Jozsef Konczer","Statistics Theory (math.ST)","This work contains the mathematical exploration of a few prototypical games in which central concepts from statistics and probability theory naturally emerge. The first two kinds of games are termed Fisher and Bayesian games, which are connected to Frequentist and Bayesian statistics, respectively. Later, a more general type of game is introduced, termed Statistical game, in which a further parameter, the players' relative risk aversion, can be set. In this work, we show that Fisher and Bayesian games can be viewed as limiting cases of Statistical games. Therefore, Statistical games can be viewed as a unified framework, incorporating both Frequentist and Bayesian statistics. Furthermore, a philosophical framework is (re-)presented -- often referred to as minimax regret criterion -- as a general approach to decision making. The main motivation for this work was to embed Bayesian statistics into a broader decision-making framework, where, based on collected data, actions with consequences have to be made, which can be translated to utilities (or rewards/losses) of the decision-maker. The work starts with the simplest possible toy model, related to hypothesis testing and statistical inference. This choice has two main benefits: i.) it allows us to determine (conjecture) the behaviour of the equilibrium strategies in various limiting cases ii.) this way, we can introduce Statistical games without requiring additional stochastic parameters. The work contains game theoretical methods related to two-player, non-cooperative games to determine and prove equilibrium strategies of Fisher, Bayesian and Statistical games. It also relies on analytical tools for derivations concerning various limiting cases.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 19:59:15 UTC (8,427 KB)"
"135","Reward Design for Justifiable Sequential Decision-Making","Aleksa Sukovic, Goran Radanovic","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Equipping agents with the capacity to justify made decisions using supporting evidence represents a cornerstone of accountable decision-making. Furthermore, ensuring that justifications are in line with human expectations and societal norms is vital, especially in high-stakes situations such as healthcare. In this work, we propose the use of a debate-based reward model for reinforcement learning agents, where the outcome of a zero-sum debate game quantifies the justifiability of a decision in a particular state. This reward model is then used to train a justifiable policy, whose decisions can be more easily corroborated with supporting evidence. In the debate game, two argumentative agents take turns providing supporting evidence for two competing decisions. Given the proposed evidence, a proxy of a human judge evaluates which decision is better justified. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in learning policies for prescribing and justifying treatment decisions of septic patients. We show that augmenting the reward with the feedback signal generated by the debate-based reward model yields policies highly favored by the judge when compared to the policy obtained solely from the environment rewards, while hardly sacrificing any performance. Moreover, in terms of the overall performance and justifiability of trained policies, the debate-based feedback is comparable to the feedback obtained from an ideal judge proxy that evaluates decisions using the full information encoded in the state. This suggests that the debate game outputs key information contained in states that is most relevant for evaluating decisions, which in turn substantiates the practicality of combining our approach with human-in-the-loop evaluations. Lastly, we showcase that agents trained via multi-agent debate learn to propose evidence that is resilient to refutations and closely aligns with human preferences.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 14:29:30 UTC (1,038 KB)"

We refer to these multi-principal, multi-agent scenarios as delegation games. In such games, there are two important failure modes: problems of control (where an agent fails to act in line their principal's preferences) and problems of cooperation (where the agents fail to work well together). In this paper we formalise and analyse these problems, further breaking them down into issues of alignment (do the players have similar preferences?) and capabilities (how competent are the players at satisfying those preferences?). We show -- theoretically and empirically -- how these measures determine the principals' welfare, how they can be estimated using limited observations, and thus how they might be used to help us design more aligned and cooperative AI systems.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 14:17:41 UTC (17,188 KB)"

As LLM-driven agents learn to negotiate and act like real humans, how to evaluate agents' bargaining abilities remains an open problem. For the first time, we formally described the Bargaining task as an asymmetric incomplete information game, defining the gains of the Buyer and Seller in multiple bargaining processes. It allows us to quantitatively assess an agent's performance in the Bargain task. We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance. To address the challenge, we propose a novel approach called OG-Narrator that integrates a deterministic Offer Generator to control the price range of Buyer's offers, and an LLM Narrator to create natural language sentences for generated offers. Experimental results show that OG-Narrator improves the buyer's deal rates from 26.67% to 88.88% and brings a ten times of multiplication of profits on all baselines, even a model that has not been aligned.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 13:36:58 UTC (468 KB)[v2] Thu, 29 Feb 2024 13:04:11 UTC (468 KB)"

We leverage the law of large deviations and degree theory to establish the almost sure convergence of the offline learning solution to the true solution as the number of data samples increases.

Departing from previous benchmarks focusing on simplistic tasks and individual model capability, PCA-Bench introduces three complex scenarios: autonomous driving, domestic robotics, and open-world games. Given task instructions and diverse contexts, the model is required to seamlessly integrate multiple capabilities of Perception, Cognition, and Action in a reasoning chain to make accurate decisions. Moreover, PCA-Bench features error localization capabilities, scrutinizing model inaccuracies in areas such as perception, knowledge, or reasoning. This enhances the reliability of deploying MLLMs. To balance accuracy and efficiency in evaluation, we propose PCA-Eval, an automatic evaluation protocol, and assess 10 prevalent MLLMs. The results reveal significant performance disparities between open-source models and powerful proprietary models like GPT-4 Vision. To address this, we introduce Embodied-Instruction-Evolution (EIE), an automatic framework for synthesizing instruction tuning examples in multimodal embodied environments. EIE generates 7,510 training examples in PCA-Bench and enhances the performance of open-source MLLMs, occasionally surpassing GPT-4 Vision (+3\% in decision accuracy), thereby validating the effectiveness of EIE.

While prior works have focused on generating motion guided by text, music, or scenes, these typically result in isolated motions confined to short durations. Instead, we address the generation of long, continuous sequences guided by a series of varying textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce FlowMDM, the first diffusion-based model that generates seamless Human Motion Compositions (HMC) without any postprocessing or redundant denoising steps. For this, we introduce the Blended Positional Encodings, a technique that leverages both absolute and relative positional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically, global motion coherence is recovered at the absolute stage, whereas smooth and realistic transitions are built at the relative stage. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy, realism, and smoothness on the Babel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single description per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention, which makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time. Finally, to address the limitations of existing HMC metrics, we propose two new metrics: the Peak Jerk and the Area Under the Jerk, to detect abrupt transitions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:59:40 UTC (15,139 KB)"

One of the important questions to be answered is how to conduct credit assignment in a multi-agent system. There have been many schemes designed to conduct credit assignment by multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Although these credit assignment schemes have been proved useful in improving the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning, most of them are designed heuristically without a rigorous theoretic basis and therefore infeasible to understand how agents cooperate. In this thesis, we aim at investigating the foundation of credit assignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning via cooperative game theory. We first extend a game model called convex game and a payoff distribution scheme called Shapley value in cooperative game theory to Markov decision process, named as Markov convex game and Markov Shapley value respectively. We represent a global reward game as a Markov convex game under the grand coalition. As a result, Markov Shapley value can be reasonably used as a credit assignment scheme in the global reward game. Markov Shapley value possesses the following virtues: (i) efficiency; (ii) identifiability of dummy agents; (iii) reflecting the contribution and (iv) symmetry, which form the fair credit assignment. Based on Markov Shapley value, we propose three multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms called SHAQ, SQDDPG and SMFPPO. Furthermore, we extend Markov convex game to partial observability to deal with the partially observable problems, named as partially observable Markov convex game. In application, we evaluate SQDDPG and SMFPPO on the real-world problem in energy networks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:43:15 UTC (58,384 KB)"

Open ad hoc teamwork further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. The state-of-the-art solution to this problem is graph-based policy learning (GPL), leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents and effectively address open teams. GPL's performance is superior to other methods, but its joint Q-value representation presents challenges for interpretation, hindering further development of this research line and applicability. In this paper, we establish a new theory to give an interpretation for the joint Q-value representation employed in GPL, from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm based on GPL framework, to complement the critical features that facilitate learning, but overlooked in GPL. Through experiments, we demonstrate the correctness of our theory by comparing the performance of the resulting algorithm with GPL in dynamic team compositions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:04:33 UTC (8,391 KB)"

Discrete strategies involve deterministic actions with a fixed probability of one, whereas continuous strategies employ intermediate probabilities to convey the extent of cooperation and emphasize expected payoffs. Mixed strategies, though akin to continuous ones, calculate immediate payoffs based on the action chosen at a given moment within intermediate probabilities. Although previous research has highlighted the distinct impacts of these strategic approaches on fostering cooperation, the reasons behind the differing levels of cooperation among these approaches have remained somewhat unclear. This study explores how these strategic approaches influence cooperation in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game, particularly in networked populations with varying clustering coefficients. Our research goes beyond existing studies by revealing that the differences in cooperation levels between these strategic approaches are not confined to finite populations; they also depend on the clustering coefficients of these populations. In populations with nonzero clustering coefficients, we observed varying degrees of stable cooperation for each strategic approach across multiple simulations, with mixed strategies showing the most variability, followed by continuous and discrete strategies. However, this variability in cooperation evolution decreased in populations with a clustering coefficient of zero, narrowing the differences in cooperation levels among the strategies. These findings suggest that in more realistic settings, the robustness of cooperation systems may be compromised, as the evolution of cooperation through mixed and continuous strategies introduces a degree of unpredictability.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 04:34:05 UTC (12,957 KB)"

Given the discrete nature of RL algorithms, they are oblivious to the effects of the choice of control rate: finding the correct control rate can be difficult and mistakes often result in excessive use of computing resources or even lack of convergence. We propose Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (SEAC), a novel off-policy actor-critic algorithm to address this issue. SEAC implements elastic time steps, time steps with a known, variable duration, which allow the agent to change its control frequency to adapt to the situation. In practice, SEAC applies control only when necessary, minimizing computational resources and data usage. We evaluate SEAC's capabilities in simulation in a Newtonian kinematics maze navigation task and on a 3D racing video game, Trackmania. SEAC outperforms the SAC baseline in terms of energy efficiency and overall time management, and most importantly without the need to identify a control frequency for the learned controller. SEAC demonstrated faster and more stable training speeds than SAC, especially at control rates where SAC struggled to converge. We also compared SEAC with a similar approach, the Continuous-Time Continuous-Options (CTCO) model, and SEAC resulted in better task performance. These findings highlight the potential of SEAC for practical, real-world RL applications in robotics.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 20:49:04 UTC (7,525 KB)"
